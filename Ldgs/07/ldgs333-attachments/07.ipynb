      "['\"If you like ridiculous plots, shallow characters, exploding cars, this is the movie for you.  Cruise spent all this money producing this vehicle for himself, and his taste is in his butt.  The female lead is one of the most interesting parts.  I can\\'t remember a single line she said, though the few she had should have stuck if only because of their scarcity.  Find a better way to spend a couple of hours.\"', '\"I see Mission: Impossible 2 as \"Hulk 03\" of M:I movies. Both were hated and bashed by moviegoers, although those were excellent. For example Hulk 03 still has the best CGI and it has lots of action, but people remember the first 40 minutes, being very boring for them while the real boring one with bad CGI was the second one. People say that this sequel with a boring first half has a different style than the original first film, but wasn\\'t it supposed to be like that? If you ask me, the first film was an exclusively stylish, low key espionage thriller, but it was little boring and slow paced at times. I liked and very enjoyed even the third movie with magical JJ Abrams touch! However, this second film perfectly delivers as an action packed and believe me that clichÃ© virus story and the dated romance is not the point. This is a John Woo movie! In this sequel, now Ethan Hunt is a trained martial artist, a gunfighter, what would be the best that could happen? In this movie, the mission teller device does not terminate itself by smoldering, because this is a John Woo movie! In the second half, you are awarded with some incredible stunt work and action sequences! Also I think the best soundtrack for a M:I movie is here, too. The things that Hunt performs by that motorbike is amazing. If you expect a Bullitt type of a movie, of course you will be disappointed, but it is pure action and pure entertainment. If you look at the posters of the first two films, you can see that while the first one looks like a classical, old school spy thriller, the second one prepares you for a hell ride! We watch a different, tricky Ethan Hunt here equipped with lots of skills, almost like a single army and I love that! This is not a sophisticated or intellectual action film, but it is definitely not an empty or dumb summer blockbuster. The tone of the movie is just perfect for a M:I movie of course with a different touch by Woo! The mountain scene of the film is a hilarious and pure joy! The last 20 minutes of the film is an awesome action packed! Is it exaggerating? Yes. Is it overblown? No. Is it hilarious and cool? Definitely Yes! John Woo is a great action filmmaker and he doesn\\'t make movies like this anymore.\"', '\"The reviews that I read of this movie didn\\'t prepare me for it at all. It\\'s a hoot. The audience laughed and cheered at all the \"right\" places, so it wasn\\'t just me. It\\'s an action-comedy, no matter what the reviews say. And Samuel Jackson is terrific, as always.\"', '\"\"a low down dirty shame\" - that\\'s the name of the movie this movie was based on, originally directed & starring Keenan Wayans (1994). But that film is as much comedy as action film. This is... well, obviously, Samuel Jackson wanted to show that he could play \"black\"; but I don\\'t know who ever doubted that.The original Shaft suffered from a lack of proper pacing, due largely to the editor\\'s uncertainty as to where that film was going.This film suffers from the fact that - being a borrowed story all around - the story itself isn\\'t sure where it\\'s going.Well, it\\'s nice to see Richard roundtree on the big screen again - a wholly underrated and type-cast actor, he deserves more and better roles.\"', '\"The first time I saw the movie (in the cinema) I was impressed with great mountain view where Ethan was subjugating the rocky height. Accompanying song was selected carefully. You just want to be there too. Then the fun begins. Characters were developed precisely. Wise boss, two antagonistic heroes, highly trained, with 6th sense and mastered playing, beautiful smart lady and talent actor Luther Stickell. Everything is involved - humour, up-to-date action, high technology and. humanity and love. I have seen it 4 times in all. Thanks to all Creators of this film.\"', '\"I LOVED the original, and found this sequel much less brilliant, but still a decent movie. Some good critics have slammed it for not being a work of originality and genius, but that is unfair. True, sequels, by definition, must be taken along with the first movie that inspired them, and put in the overall context. But, can\\'t sequels also be judged, at least somewhat, as movies in their own right?Given the \"entire franchise\" context, and the \"stand alone\" criterion, \"Men in Black II\" has its moments, but clearly isn\\'t as good as \"MIB.\" One nice thing to say in its favor, though, is the evident fact that the director and producers did NOT populate the second movie with 50,000 more aliens, puppets, and cartoons, as so often happens in sequels. That showed a bit of restraint. Also, the plot didn\\'t \"undo\" all the achievements of the characters and the story in the original. That is, whatever we as the audience might have enjoyed in the make-believe world of the first movie remains intact. Note the difference in some franchises, where virtually ALL of the gains, wins, achievements, etc. obtained by the characters in the original are essentially wiped out, nullified by some lame-brained Hollywood Suit who can only see the dollar signs of the sequels. \"Back to the Future\" comes to mind--- a brilliant, sweet, and innocently spiritual movie wherein characters changed their destinies and overcame fear, limitations, etc.--- only to have all of that completely undone in the opening frames of the second movie.\"MIB II\" at least takes up where the first one left off--- (although I\\'d have loved to have seen the gorgeous and interesting Linda Fiorintino return as agent \"L.\")---and that alone is worth high praise, given the crap that \"summer blockbuster\" movie producers often deliver via sequels. \"MIB II\" is true to the theme, although not very well done. It is a bit dim, a bit shoddy-- but at least it is an honest sequel! And that is, indeed, cause for praise and admiration.Bottom line: decent. Not bad. \"B-,\" or a 6 out of 10.\"', '\"Princess is being shipped out of China to U.S.A so when they find out that she\\'s been kidnapped 5 Men the Uncle and the Soldiers one of them Jackie Chan going after to rescue her with the gold .Meanwhile Owen Wilson with this cowboy thief look he and his crew get on the train to rob everybody with everything and the new guy on the group from Texas kills Jackie\\'s Uncle which he gets after them for revenge while fighting with each other Owen And Jackie find themselves partnering of course Owen trying in the beginning he\\'s in for the gold and Jackie to rescue the Princess Pei-Pei.In other side Jackie is lost headed in the wrong direction by Owen which he fights this people who are trying to pick on this little girl which he saves her and then he is taken to the Indian\\'s where he gains a wife and new experiences .And in the end Owen and Jackie reunites after a conflict about Owen saying he\\'s not friend with Jackie he doesn\\'t ride with me .

I grew up watching this . Another Classy Jackie :)\"', '\"I\\'ve just finished a \"Mission Impossible\" marathon and to my dismay, can\\'t figure why this sequel rated so poorly. If all those who voted over the years had an opportunity (or the patience or the time) to watch all four episodes back to back, I think this rating thing would fare differently.Is there anyone who can honestly say the scene 2 of this movie, where Tom Cruise is free solo climbing in The Grand Canyon, jumping from one escarpment to another, slipping to an almost certain death and hanging from one hand like even Alex Honnold would not dare to try (Google that guy), is not an absolutely stunning piece of action footage. For good measure, the music playing in the background of that scene, the song \\'Iko Iko\\', was, for those who know the story or origin of the song, a brilliant choice. The cinematography in that movie was superior to the original movie, in my not all that humble opinion, and certainly as good as the following two sequels. Critics, including music critics, all agree the OST (original sound track) in M I-2 is the best; I could not reproduce, at home, the sound I heard at the cinema, at least not without my neighbors getting very upset. I remember, twelve years after the fact, the excitement I felt walking out of the cinema; the others were also exciting, just not quite as much for me. The franchise does so well because many other \\'moviegoers\\' walk out of the cinema with that very same excitement.I must acknowledge that, as with all big Hollywood action features, the story as well as the stunts defy reality and it\\'s mostly fantasy, so the \\'M.I.\\' films are aimed at thrill seekers and who isn\\'t one from time to time. Anyone trying to judge these movies, comparing them to classics or award winning novel based dramas, is farting downwind.The first three \\'M.I.\\' had renowned directors, but John Woo was unquestionably the best at action sequences, which abound in M I-2. The motorcycle chase scene is one hell of a superbly choreographed and edited action scene. Dougray Scott is the best villain of all the four M.I.; argue that one if you can. The best female co-star of all four \\'M.I.\\', for my liking, is Thandie Newton. I know I am completely counter majority opinion here, but I maintain that back to back viewing of the four movies, or viewing in the same year would generate far different results.\"', '\"I really didn\\'t like this film. I felt bad for Mr. Brosnan. The following is all IMO. I didn\\'t like the title song. Thought is was not good. I still think Ursula Andress looked better in a bikini. The plot was bizarre to the nth degree. John Cleese was annoying as the new Q. I would add more It would take way to long. I did like 2 things: 1. The new Aston Martin and 2. The cigar/factory.\"', '\"Thief wants his girl back and plan a job to rob his rival. He gathers a team. The robbery is a success and the girl goes back with him. A rather superficial story set in the colourful and well illuminated Las Vegas. The actors play well but not all are convincing. The robbery is ingenious and is the core of the movie. But towards the end there was this feeling of unfinished business. As if a piece was missing. Or maybe a too superficial movie. The trailer was more attractive than the movie itself. Nevertheless, it is still enjoyable to watch.\"', '\"This movie was a big hit when it first came out in theaters, especially with it\\'s budget. It\\'s actually pretty obvious why this movie was so popular, mainly because of the suped up cars with girls and some aggressive racing and bits of action. In another words this is a popcorn flick for most guys and despite the plot not being that good, it still has elements which keeps the movie from being boring or dull. It\\'s one of those movies where it\\'s better to shut off your brain and just accept that entertaining and yet stupid stuff happening on screen in order to have a good time with it. This is also the movie where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker got their big break, and so this movie is the biggest thing that has probably ever happened to them especially when it comes to being in the movie industry. So yeah basically to sum it up, this is a film with a passable plot but has some thrill rides to go with it. Overall the execution was well done, it\\'s a stupid/cheesy flick and yet it\\'s cool and entertaining. Like one of Vin\\'s line in this movie \"You break her heart, I\\'ll break your neck\" it\\'s lame but stands out although most of this movie is pretty cheesy for the most part.7.4/10\"', '\"At the request of my friends & family over the recent holidays I went to see this film.  Though it\\'s not my usual M.O., I really enjoyed this movie. I\\'ve not seen the original \\'Rat Pack\\' version of the movie (except bits and pieces), so a comparison between the two is not possible on my part. This version I found playful and relatively harmless, and the plot twists are undeniably clever.  The comradery between the actors is the most entertaining part of this film in my opinion. Elliot Gould\\'s part had to be my favorite character if forced to pick, followed in close order by Clooney, Pitt & Damon.  Actually all of the actors did an excellent job with their roles.This movie won\\'t change the world, or probably change your mind about anything significant, but the plot is fun, the cinematography is excellent, the actors all shine in their roles, and on occasion that is enough.\"', '\"My Rating: ** out of ****.Bonds fans should watch Die Another Day for two reasons: 1) It is the 20th Bond and marked the 40th Anniversary of the series, 2)To Try and figure out what the 142 million was spent on. Die Another Day was a disappointment, one of the biggest disappointments of 2002. I was expecting something good, maybe too good, for the 40th anniversary of the longest action series.\\nDie Another Day starts out good, it has an opening scene that immediately caught my attention. As much as some people hated Madonnas song, I liked it, its definitely not the best theme song but I was satisfied by it. The scenes in Cuba werent bad they were kind of interesting, except for Halle Berry but I\\'ll explain that later. There is a nice action scene in Iceland, with Bond driving around in his Invisible Aston Martin (I have to admit) being chased by an evil hench man in his Jaguar.Unfortunately, the chase scene I just mentioned was about the only good scene in Iceland. The Ice Lair (Bad Guys Lair or something like that) looks extremely cheap from the outside and doesnt look much better from the inside. Also, theres a scene when Bond is parasurfing, where it shows some of the worst special effects I have ever seen. Which makes me wonder how in the hell this movie could have cost 142 million?This is where DAD really starts to disappoint. Pierce Brosnan looks like he is already getting to old to do this, hes lost some of his charisma and charm. Halle Berry looks good and is pretty leathal in a fight scene is annoying everytime she opens her mouth. She also seemed to be a rip off of Michelle Yeoh\\'s superior Wai Lin. Rosamund Pike also looks good but isn\\'t really effective either. Toby Stephens (I think thats his name) is one of the worst bad guys in Bond History. The only two that even have an impact is Rick Yune, who is quite effective and scary looking as the bad guys henchman, and John Cleese who has a brief but funny role as Q. Judy Dench has also lost her certain wit as M.Die Another Day ranks among the worst of Bond. It is not quite the worst but its not that far away. It is worth seeing once just because its the 20th bond, but never to be seen again.\"', '\"A masterpiece of an action movie is what you get indeed. I recently bought the 2 disc special edition and I must say it\\'s worth every cent. I wish I could have seen it on the silver screen, but you\\'ll still be thrilled with excitement when watching this one! Michael Bay (I know lots of users here don\\'t like him) is in my opinion the God of action movies and one of my personal favorite directors to be walking on this earth. If you have seen The Rock, with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, you have to admit you weren\\'t exactly falling asleep.I can\\'t quite remember what the first Bad Boys movie was about, but that\\'s not necessary to understand this one though. The sequel is a whole new story, but fortunately with the same 2 main characters. I wish I could explain what the sequel is about... The fact is, it\\'s about so many things that you might start to think (after you\\'ve seen it) that they were like 3 movies in one. Read the plot outline for more information :) Another thing that\\'s rather unusual for an action movie is that it goes on for 147 minutes!! That\\'s just wow, because i can\\'t stand 90 minute movies with lots of action and poor characters. This is a great ride, filled with exciting characters, humor, unexpected plot turns and of course, lots of car chases and crashing cars and so on. Just sit back, turn on your surround system and enjoy the show.And then Amir Mokri. I bet you\\'ve never heard of this man, but o.m.g., he is (in my eyes) the *best* director of photography in Hollywood. He also did The Salton Sea, with Val Kilmer. What I personally like so much about him, is his very effective use of colors and camera angles. If you compare, let\\'s say Romeo Must Die, to Bad Boys 2, you\\'ll laugh at the poor cinematography of the first one. In the end, Mokri and Bay are both responsible for the look of the movie, the intensity of the characters, the surroundings, the feelings you get and the overall atmosphere. I\\'d say that\\'s a big responsibility! Luckily they\\'re so talented to make it all look very professional and very \\'never-seen-before\\'-like.I have little to say about the actor\\'s performances. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith do as usual, a bit better even. ;-) Maybe a bit over-acting by Jordi MollÃ\\xa0, the main bad guy. Peter Stormare is as freaky as he usually is ;-) One last piece of advice, don\\'t switch off your DVD player before the first half hour. I turned mine off when i rented BB2 the first time, regretting it now, of course. You might expect a story about people doing drugs in night clubs, but it\\'s not. Give it (Bay + BB2) a chance, keep an open mind, don\\'t go criticize the movie when watching it, just look. Keep your brain locked in a closet. If you\\'re into romantic comedies or drama\\'s, don\\'t give it a low rating just because you don\\'t like action movies. And if you\\'re a professional critic, at least try to appreciate the work that\\'s been done behind the scenes. It\\'s a masterpiece in it\\'s genre. 10/10\"', '\"Directed by John Singleton. Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jeffrey Wright, Christian Bale, Vanessa Williams, Toni Collette, Richard Roundtree, Busta Rhymes, Dan Hedaya, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Daniel von Bargen. (R)Reboot of the iconic blaxploitation franchise (or is it a far-flung sequel?) with Jackson as John Shaft\\'s nephew, a detective focused on taking down smug, murderous \"rich kid\" Bale. Connections to the original series are tenuous; Roundtree shows up in character, but Jackson rarely exhibits the same silky swagger that the private eye was known for (it\\'s just the typical cruise-control Sam Jackson performance). Perhaps in a nod to changing audience sensibilities, the \"sex machine to all the chicks\" is more or less neutered here (all the lovin\\' takes place offscreen or during the messily stylized opening credits), but he still roughs up and guns down his fair share of punks. Wright and Bale at least manage to leave impressions as the main villains (though the latter is sidelined for most of the second half). Singleton brings energy but not much style or coherency to the project; Isaac Hayes\\' title song is milked for all its worth, but a good tune is a good tune. A few famous faces can be spotted making cameos, including Gordon Parks, who directed the original; Mekhi Phifer, Gloria Reuben and Elizabeth Banks have bit parts.50/100\"', '\"You could perhaps make collectible trading cards out of the unnecessary, overly-long sequences that exist in Bad Boys II. Is it possible that a mildly pretentious, ridiculous, dim-witted film could get a sequel that is even more pretentious, ridiculous, and dim-witted? When you have a film with Michael Bay\\'s name firmly stamped on the cover, one thing is for certain; there will be booms and a lot of them.This is a tiresome sequel, that becomes long and winded after the first half hour because of its oppressive consumption of self-importance from very early on. This is a film that looks cocky and has nothing to hide. There is a scene in the very beginning of the film where Martin Lawrence gets shot on the cheek of his buttocks and we have to listen to a riveting commentary on how the bullet didn\\'t enter the hole but the cheek and how uncomfortable it will be to sit and how stressful it will be for him to go on. Have mercy.It\\'s scenes like that that make the movie plod along at snail\\'s pace. About halfway through this excursion I came to the consensus that the film was utterly listless, and had absolutely no ambition to be good, entertaining, or anything outside of the cloying genre of a \"popcorn flick.\" I sometimes like a good camp movie, but I despise when films use the excuse \"it\\'s an action movie, take it for what it is\" or the long over-stayed \"just turn your brain off.\" When you truly think about it, why would a movie want to proclaim itself as a \"turn your brain off\" type piece? Were the writers lazy or was the whole project lacking any form of motivation and ambition. Or was the easy route taken? I\\'m not sure, but for whatever reason, the film seems to be inherently inept.Again, the story is made complicated by a long run time, numerous dead-on-arrival conversations between criminals, tedious shootouts, astoundingly incoherent car chases, and the constant bickering between two men we are led to believe have been close friends for many years. Detectives Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) return to track down and abolish the smuggling of ecstasy through many underground routes in Florida. You may ask yourself, why does that task take 147 minutes? Because every five, the film is punctuated with either a redundant scream-fest between the detectives or an unacceptable shootout that always results in the same turnout, making it robbed of credible suspense.Bad Boys II wouldn\\'t be so intolerable and unwatchable if it had just improved on three things; one, lee pretentiousness in the direction and the production. Everything looks too production-heavy, incredibly overbearing, and ridiculously glossy as if it was given a paint job by Hollywood. Two, the film\\'s cynical mean-spirit that is carried throughout the entire picture. Multiple scenes have this built up aggression that goes nowhere except right down the drain of despair. And finally, the removal of needless sequences like the one at an electronic store, the one about being shot in places unknown, and the countless number of relentless car chases. This is one of the worst action movies I\\'ve seen in a while that didn\\'t involve metal, soulless robot monstrosities.Starring: Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Directed by: Michael Bay.\"', '\"Oceans Eleven is a slick caper movie with a great all star ensemble cast who turn in terrific performances including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts among many others. Director Steven Soderbergh is admirable in making this film which is definitely the better of the remakes that have been coming out lately. The rest of the talented cast including the late Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner, and Elliot Guild are just as impressive as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Ocean\\'s Eleven is a film thats better to see without knowing too much about it because any kind of spoiler can ruin some of the surprises in store for those who watch it. Despite some flaws with the film juggling a bit too many characters and a slow pace at times, Ocean\\'s Eleven is still a good movie. Overall I was very impressed with this one and if you give a chance I\\'m sure you\\'ll enjoy it too. Ocean\\'s Eleven has an intricate story with just enough humor, drama, excitement, surprises, and exceptional performances by the whole cast who definitely make this caper film worth the time to watch.\"', '\"Ok, having missed this movie in the theater, I finally saw it on DVD. I have to say I\\'m glad I didn\\'t pay admission prices for this.\\nWe start the movie with Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) being a historian. Due to some changes in the Russian government, he is suddenly catapulted into being a one-man NSA/CIA. We see Ryan, who just yesterday was a nobody, turn into the hero that controls both US & Russian war policy. Not bad if you\\'re looking for a brain-dead action movie, but don\\'t come looking here for any type of believable plot.\"', '\"Perhaps I expected too much... but must also say that I left movie having had an overall enjoyable experience.  The acting was great, the story good... but having read the book and followed the other Clancy movies, I found myself a little confused and disappointed.  When they say, \"Based on a novel by Tom Clancy\"... they mean roughly based.  The story was changed in many subtle, but drastic, ways... and while they were there, they did not really take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie.\"', '\"Die Another Day has taken huge amounts of bashing from many 007 fans, from many different corners of the fanbase. Wheter or not people agree on the Roger Moore movies being too silly, the Daltons too serious or the Brosnans too shallow, everybody seems to agree that Die Another Day was like this big meteorite that sent the franchise to extinction, ready to be rebooted with Daniel Craig. Being a Bond fan myself, I remember seeing it at the theater and being greatly amused by it. Picking it up later on DVD, my enthusiasm did falter upon second viewing. But I happened to see it again just the other day, and I realized that it really is quite an entertaining piece of electric boogaloo. After Craig\\'s two outings in the Bond role, this sort of comic book 007 seems archaic and so does Pierce Brosnan - he can, almost, be placed beside the Spice Girls and blend in on the \"cool britannia/90\\'s memorabilia\" shelf.That being said, he wasn\\'t bad in the role at all. People tend to fuss and fridget about what should and shouldn\\'t be Bond, and forget that one of the most fundamental traits of the franchise is that the movies always carefully mirror their time and evolve along with the decades. The gritty and rough, slightly depressing, world of Daniel Craig\\'s 007 isn\\'t strange considering that we\\'re living in a rather disillusioned time and for some reason people have a bigger need for darkness and violence (horror has to be Saw and Hostel, Batman has to bee The Dark Knight, fantasy has to be orchs being decapitated, and a bright, dumb character like Jar-Jar Binks is not allowed today). It\\'s no wonder that James Bond, today, is a dark and depressed hero. What hero today isn\\'t? But do you remember the 90s? It was the decade of naive optimism, at least as far as pop culture goes, and I remember the hype surrounding the return of James Bond very well. Today we say that Bond is \"modernized\". Even back then you said it was \"a Bond for the 90s\". I don\\'t think anybody in those days would have expected anything else than the type of comic book-adventure James Bond movie. Looking back on it, the Brosnan movies may vary in quality but as part of the franchise they make perfect sense. I think Die Another Day came along too late, proving it to be one of the very few times when a Bond movie had forgot to catch up with the times. But after 9/11, this can be said about a great many deal of films around 2001-2002.One peculiar thing about Die Another Day is that, being the 20th movie in the series, it has a meta level that gets in the way of almost everything else in the movie. It really is \"the 40th anniversary movie\" of the series, like some kind of special episode of a TV series or a weird, gimmicky kind of self-parodic unofficial movie. It\\'s not just that it has, at least, one nod to every other movie in the series, there\\'s this whole spectacle of celebration throughout the movie. It can\\'t be a coincidence that one of the greatest pop stars of all time does the title song, or that this is the Bond movie where Halle Berry is the bond girl. Or that Monnypenny gets her cravings satisfied. Or that the Aston Martin is invisible! The movie is over the top from the very beginning, when 007 is captured and tortured for 14 months, to the end where.... well, there\\'s a whole lot of things blowing up anyway. Towards the end you really feel closer to watching a Jerry Bruckheimer production than a James Bond movie.Die Another Day has many flaws, not only because it\\'s one of those 007 movies where the plot really is a ritual (did I forget to mention the plot? No I didn\\'t). A lot of things in it are silly, or dumb, or predictable, or \"been there done that\" and it\\'s all baked into a frantic frenzy of a movie, making it a little too much to even bare. Be that as it may, I like the movie for what it is. As an escapist action film it\\'s a lot better than a lot of other movies, I\\'m not particularly offended by anything in it, and I find there has been a lot of Bond films a lot worse - though it admittedly isn\\'t on the top list. Also, I find all of the Brosnan movies quite diverse form each other and not at all as formulaic and clone-like as critics have made it. I must say that I prefer Die Another Day\\'s madness over the dull Tomorrow Never Dies which in my opinion is the worst Bond movie to date. Both movies share the same trait - they come off more as fairly ill-conceived, generic action-vehicles than proper Bond movies - but at least Die Another Day is so preposterous that you really get enforced to watch it. They don\\'t share the subtle qualities of GoldenEye and The World Is Not Enough - two very under-appreciated Bond films, that will perhaps get more respect with time - but as comic books, Tomorrow Never Dies is dull and Die Another Day... well, a lot more fun. Apart from the very odd torture intro, it is a movie that clearly isn\\'t trying to be serious at all. It has thrown away all credibility and novelty and comes off much like Octopussy, Roger Moore\\'s most unbelievably silly Bond film. But that\\'s also a kind of Bond, mind you. As much as Dalton and Craig have fought bloody, Moore and John Cleese have made it all into a joke. But that\\'s alright. No actor, or single 007 movie, has ever had monopoly on the franchise. As it has before, this kind of silly Bond will return.\"', '\"Spoilers withinAdmittedly, when I watched this film, it was late & I was absolutely knackered, thus it had to be paused at least 3 times for the missus to explain what was going on, as it went way over my head.I was somewhat surprised therefore to see reviewers complain of a tedious, weak plot. I agree with the many though that have said it was boring. This wasn\\'t an awful film, but I certainly wouldn\\'t recommend it.As gorgeous as the female lead was, the romance was ridiculous.Also, like so many films, it seemed to be all about the big, high budget finale & one or two other interspersed scenes with some fancy fighting. For the other 75% of the film though, very little went on, it seemed the plot (and I use the term plot in the loosest possible sense) was just plonked in without much thought, just as a prelude for the next stunt scene.Yes, the stunts were impressive, amazing even, but anyone with half a brain knew exactly how it\\'d all end up. It was just a case of waiting for it. Wait we did. It must\\'ve taken 30 minutes just to close the story off & even the missus (who enjoyed it far more than me) had lost the will to live about 20 minutes from the end.I also find films where people takes others faces off & swap them with there own very tedious. Had it just happened in the one scene on the plane at the start, it might just have been ok. But it had been repeated half a dozen times by the end, so you spend the rest of the film wasting your time wondering who is actually doing the speaking & missing the lines, as I obviously did. You half expected Tom Cruise to reach for a gun, only to peel off an outer layer of plastic & find it\\'s an aubergine, it got that silly.I spent years doing A-Levels & a degree, trying every method know to man to stay awake, while reading theories & attempting to store information in my head. Once those days are gone, you don\\'t want go through it again, taking in spy films, where the characters are unlikely to mean anything to you.Had this story been told by an old uncle or grandad & condensed down into 10 minutes, it may possibly have been interesting, but beyond that, it\\'s just not really a story worthy of a 2 hour film.Having slated it though, it\\'s not awful. I\\'ve seen far worse films & one or two stunts are watchable in moderation, but in a time where nothing seems beyond stuntman & film crews, the days of making the audience go \\'whoooah\\' are gone.4/10\"', '\"...and while everything on the page is superbly crafty and clever by Ted Griffin, everything magical comes from the cinema of it. David Holmes score, the cohesive and fun editing, the tremendous cast at the top of their game; clearly stretching their legs, the flourishes of improv and the pure energy of it all. It\\'s a hangout movie and a heist movie, it\\'s tricky but never tricks the audience. It\\'s confident, laid back and exciting. It\\'s an extremely well made and timeless flick. When Soderbergh goes popcorn he really delivers something special.\"', '\"If Paramount Pictures plans to produce a sequel to the new \"Shaft,\" then they need to develop a stronger storyline and provide a bolder villain who can go the distance with \"the cat who won\\'t cop out when there is danger all about.\" Were it not for its blazing gunplay and blistering profanity, this second-rate but serviceable update of Gordon Park\\'s \"Shaft\" would resemble an average episode of \"NYPD Blue.\" The action scenes in director John Singleton\\'s \"Shaft\" lack the bravura of the Richard Roundtree originals. Aside from an occasionally memorable one-liner, the dialogue pales by comparison with the lingo contrived by the late Oscar winning scenarist Ernest Tidyman. (Not only did Tidyman forge the \"Shaft\" character in a series of novels and two scripts, but he also penned the screenplay for director William Friedkin\\'s \"The French Connection!\") The bankrupt quality in the creative storytelling process with \"Shaft\" (2000) boils down to its half-baked premise. No, Samuel L. Jackson doesn\\'t replace Richard Roundtree as the seminal black private eye. Instead, he plays Shaft\\'s nephew! Sounds like an urban contemporary alternative to \"The Mask of Zorro!\" Basically, \"Shaft\" focuses on hate crime. The racist son of a white real estate tycoon beats an unarmed African-American, Trey Howard (Mekhi Phifer of \"Higher Learning\"), to death outside an elite New York City restaurant. A white bartender on a cigarette break, Diane Palmieri (a frumpy Toni Collette of \"The Sixth Sense\"), witnesses the murder from across the street. Walter Wade Jr. (creepy Christian Bale of \"American Psycho\") threatens her about testifying against him in court. When Detective John Shaft\" (Samuel L. Jackson of \"Pulp Fiction\") shows up in his stylist Armani leather trench coat, he punches the despicable Wade in the face twice, then devotes himself to tracking down the scared barkeep. He wants to sink Wade Jr., with Diane\\'s testimony. Initially, Singleton characterizes Samuel L. Jackson\\'s Shaft in one illuminating long shot that shows him striding up a street against on-coming traffic. Although Jackson\\'s Shaft is the nephew to Roundtree\\'s Shaft, he handles himself more like Inspector Harry Callahan\\'s half-brother! Unfortunately, for Shaft, once Wade makes bail, the obnoxious anus skips town for sanctuary in far-off Switzerland. According to Wade in a telephone call to his nemesis, he made bail because of the two blows that Shaft dealt him that broke his nose. Meanwhile, in a move reminiscent of the Burt Reynolds\\' classic \"Sharkey\\'s Machine,\" Shaft finds himself reassigned from homicide to narcotics. Singleton reinvents Shaft as a volatile loose cannon on deck. After one of many drug busts, our reckless hero confronts a pint-sized \"Scarface\" wannabe, Peoples Hernandez (the impeccable Jeffry Wright of \"Basquiat\"), and locks the ice-pick toting drug dealer up on a technicality when the witless thug touches his bullet-proof vest.Two years elapses, and Wade tries to sneak back into Gotham, only to be nabbed as he gets off his plane by Shaft. Shaft is not the only person who cannot figure out why Wade returned. The \"Shaft\" scenarists never furnish a reasonable explanation why such a worthless prick like Wade Jr., would come back to stand trial. His father and he tolerate each other, and he despises his old man\\'s mistress. Such an obvious oversight reflects poorly on Singleton and his scripters. When the Honorable Dennis Bradford (Pat Hingle of \"Hang\\'em High\") releases Wade for a second time, Shaft savors a \"Dirty Harry\" moment. Defiantly, he hurls his N.Y.P.D. shield like a kung fu weapon so that it embeds itself in the wall inches from the judge\\'s head. Easily, this is the beset single moment in \"Shaft.\" Quitting the force (like hundreds of other renegade Hollywood cops) Shaft resolves to find Diane.Christian Bale and Jeffry Wright make convincingly reptilian villains, but they emerge as narrative welterweights that don\\'t stand a snowball\\'s chance in hell against a heavyweight like Samuel L. Jackson\\'s \"Shaft.\" What \"Shaft\" desperately needs but cannot conjure up is a bold adversary like the villains in Gordon Park\\'s \"Shaft\" & \"Shaft\\'s Big Score\" and John Guillermin\\'s \"Shaft in Africa.\" When our villains argue, Singleton exposes how essentially weak they are compared to Shaft. Neither Wade nor the vertically challenged Peoples pose much of a threat to Shaft. \"Eraser\" heroine Vanessa Williams registers credibly as a tough-minded police woman who backs up Shaft in a tight spot. Dependable Dan Hedaya plays another crooked cop in the vein of the devious policeman that he portrayed in Norman Jewison\\'s \"The Hurricane.\" Ostensibly, \"Shaft\" unfolds as a gritty, authentic, but incredibly prosaic police procedural thriller with no romantic diversions. Everything in \"Shaft\" has been done before and done better. The filmmakers break no new ground dramatically or in terms of action stunts. Writer & director John Singleton of \"Boyz N the Hood\" and his scenarists Richard Price of \"Clockers\" and Shane Salerno of \"Armageddon\" let two banal subplots masquerade as the main plot. Action mystery thrillers are defined by the greed of the villain. The \"Shaft\" villains are mindless miscreants. Singleton combines them but together, they fail to substitute for a sturdy villain.Credit the \"Shaft\" producers for having the good sense not to tamper with Isaac Hayes\\' immortal theme song. British composer David Arnold of \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" reprises elements of Hayes\\' Academy Award winning music throughout the action for maximum effect and succeeds without having to alter the tracks. The \"Shaft\" producers should be applauded also for giving the original \"Shaft\"Â—Richard RoundtreeÂ—a few scenes to recreate his groundbreaking blaxploitation character. Nevertheless, compared with the earlier \"Shaft\" epics, the new \"Shaft\" struggles lamely to make up for its dire lack of romance and larger-than-life villains. Jackson delivers an abrasive, often ballistic performance as the title hero and is very convincing. Ultimately, the premise that the new \"Shaft\" has to have the same name of his uncle and be a cop (even an ex-cop) shows how short-sighted the producers were when they decided to revive the \"Shaft\" franchise.\"', '\"I liked this film.  Although it is a typical heist film, it was still suspenseful for me.I thought George Clooney and Brad Pitt played wonderfully against each other and I laughed at their jokes.  All of the other characters were funny too.The pace of this film was very relaxing, some call the beginning slow, but I was not bored.  It\\'s worth seeing.\"', '\"I guess James Bond has sold out now-- I\\'m sorry-- UPGRADED to teen-age audiences. I mean, aren\\'t they the ones who ultimately control the box office? Let\\'s make sure that we tailor these films for them because it doesn\\'t matter how believable the action is, they\\'re teen-agers-- what do they know? Look how \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" did! And that was definitely for kids between 12 to 17. You know, we need more \"American Pie\"s, \"Spider-Man\"s, \"Jay & Silent Bob\"s-- let\\'s make sure that we get 007 in the mix now! Bond was always good fun, but this is neither good nor fun. It\\'s time to stop at the 20th Bond because both he and Austin Powers are really starting to show their ages! I\\'m embarrassed that I was ever a Bond fan after seeing this dreck! They\\'re trying to spoof themselves after what Austin Powers did a few years ago. The action is superfluously ridiculous! The creators have used every plot line, every gadget, every villain, etc. An invisible car! Machines now that can reconfigure one\\'s face and body, surfing commandos, Halle Berry oxygen-deprived for five minutes and then of course, surviving! A weak Rick Yune attached to an IV suddenly springs to life in order to escape Bond! Madonna\\'s title song!....PLEASE!!! And wasn\\'t Toby Stephens a menacing bad-guy? Did Maculay Culkin grow up and take this part for free? I guess we\\'re just that stupid now! Sure, Bond films have had a checkered past, but now they\\'re doing anything for a buck these days. Do the filmmakers actually think that they\\'re going to top \"The Lord of the Rings\"? Guess so.I\\'m not shaken or stirred anymore and M \"would have no use for me\" after reading this-- so some things are better off dead. This is roadkill.A plain stupid disgrace to the Jame Bond legacy.\"', '\"I\\'ll admit I was skeptical about this movie at first.  And in fact it took until today to finally watch it.  I was one of the minority I guess that thought the first one had a great plot.  I still like the first one.  But the sequel is a wee bit more Bondish than the first.  I however did find Anthony Hopkins a bit out of place.  I had assumed ....  Eugene Kittridge would be the head boss now.  But that was not to be.The first half hour of the movie is rather slow, and it takes about 24 minutes to get to any main characters. One suggestion... don\\'t watch this on video.  It would be better on DVD with a stereo hooked up to it.It has John Woo\\'s unique slow motion shots throughout and does get annoying I suppose, but I liked it.  They don\\'t really have the tearjerker type thingy going on like the first.  (SPOILER...... to the first one included)which as everyone knows Emilio gets his rather abruptly as well as everyone else.  and Claire as well in the end.The good guys body count is much better here.    Dougray Scott I\\'ve seen twice before.  First as a rather wimpy camera man in Deep Impact and then as a kewl good guy in Ever After.  I will admit, I much prefer Mr. Scott in Ever After than to MI 2 but Woo made him into an excellent villain here.I am disappointed that the end of the movie contained some rather unoriginal music.  I\\'d heard it in The Rock and my dad was telling me before I watched the movie that it originally came from a Bud commercial.  Stick the music where it should be will yah..  Don\\'t recycle it.  Other than that I loved the score.....  get the DVD 10/10\"', '\"This was a piece of summer fluff that, while enjoyable, was weak. The plot was thin, and the ending unsatisfactory to me. Sonnenfeld tried too hard with this sequel, and it shows.Serleena, a beautiful alien with tentacles (Lara Flynn Boyle), wants something that only the retired and neurolyzed Agent Kay (Jones) knows the whereabouts of. The Men in Black agency, a beautiful pizza girl, oh, and the world, in danger, Agent Jay (Smith) must deneuralyze Kay to save well, everything.Tommy Lee Jones was the best thing about the movie--he made his character seem believable (well, as much as possible) and humorous. Although Will Smith is now an awardwinning actor with an Oscar nomination under his belt, he did not get a chance to show his dramatic or comedic talent in MIB 2. His dialog was weak and collapsed his character--neither the writers or Smith needed to try so hard to be funny in this movie.The problem or characteristic that Will Smith\\'s character, Agent Jay, was given was not resolved in the film, nor really dealt with after it was presented. This may sound small, but really bugged me walking out of the theater. (It felt like there was a scene missing in which he and Kay either show that they enjoy working together, or where Jay is released from the MIB agency.)Special effects were wonderful, and the aliens at the MIB agency wonderfully creative.Though sometimes the script was really funny, often it tried too hard. If you want a Men in Black fix, rent the first one--better yet, buy it.\"', '\"This is arguably the best of Brosnan\\'s four films as Agent 007.  With each new movie, he is able to embrace the role even better than the previous film.  This is no exception.The movie opens (non-spoiler) in the de-militarized zone in North Korea, and the action never lets up.  The story is unique, and it has some interesting characters in it too.  Be prepared to be blown away!True Bond fans will be able to appreciate all that this one has to offer, and most will probably want to see it again before its DVD release next year.  The writers and producers have made this one a hard act to follow, but let\\'s hope they can outdo themselves with Bond 21.\"', '\"Fast and the Furious was in my opinion, a really decent movie compared to what we\\'ve been given so far this year. I really enjoyed it. If you see anything on a premiere night, this is the one to see. And well worth the price of admission.\"', '\"It\\'s the fast and furious, any road is a race track, the unexpected situation is what really caught people off guard, it\\'s what makes people grit their teeth and their blood boil\"', '\"This film is wildly 1990s hip and very of it\\'s time, which is probably indicatives of how vapid the late 90s were, lacking in a clear identity of it\\'s own, instead relying on retro nostalgia. Sure there was grunge, \"Friends,\" and the Spice Girls, but those were really all just throwback as well and I\\'m not sure that\\'s much of a cultural identity. But enough about 1990s being a cultural wasteland when compared to the 60s, 70s, or 80s. As vapid and lightweight of a film as \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" is, it\\'s also a whole lot of fun. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu play the super spy/detective angels, with the help of Bosley, a always great Bill Murray, have to foil a plot to steal software or something. The plot here really doesn\\'t matter because the film is basically a series of barely connected but funny scenes/vignettes consisting of comedy, sexiness, or well done fight sequences (choreographed by Cheung-Yan Yuen, the fight choreographer from my favorite Jet Li movie \"Fist of Legend\"). The fun does feel forced at times, but it\\'s an extremely likable cast, which include a ton of familiar faces in supporting roles (Sam Rockwell, Tim Curry, LL Cool J, Luke Wilson, Matt LeBlanc, and Tom Green (there\\'s a 90s wasteland figure I\\'d forgotten about!). Crispin Glover is the biggest standout of the supporting cast as the deadly mute assassin know as \"Thin Man\" who dresses like he\\'s stepped off the set of \"The Avengers.\" Overall, \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" is the epitome of fluff, but it\\'s enjoyable fluff and not all that dissimilar from a 1960s Flint or Matt Helm movie.\"', '\"This movie is another one of John Singleton\\'s horror films as in horrible. The characters lack depth, the fight scenes are boring and unimaginable and the movie is framed together like a comic book.Only the clothes and Samuel Jackson are worth looking at in this movie. This is the worst movie of the year, even worse that the John Travolta Sci-fi bomb.Shaft used to be a private dick who was a sex machine with all the chicks. This Shaft didn\\'t get laid once.  This movie was bad, bad, bad.  And I don\\'t mean good.\"', '\"....again, pages and pages of absolutely banal comments. Know what? I enjoyed watching the film, but enjoyed reading the commentaries more !! ...and I didn\\'t see the original, so can\\'t comment on that.....but, I\\'ve performed in shows in Vegas and am fairly familiar with the security-systems they use. This film was like a \"kiddies\" version of \"Casino\".ALL of the cast were believable and each showed good acting, with the simple script they were given - what a picnic for Matt !! He could\\'ve done this role asleep. THAT was Elliott Gould ???? If that\\'s the actor I\\'m thinking of, he had the best role in the whole film. The handsome George Clooney was the handsome George Clooney, as always.....no acting involved. Brad Pitt promised a good role in the beginning, but what did he have to work with? Julia Roberts was a waste, but isn\\'t she usually? The rest of the actors did their jobs well and provided an old fart with good entertainment for an evening, as most posters commented. I\\'m still trying to understand all that high-tech stuff.....\"', '\"I truly enjoyed this movie on several levels.The plot was very compelling it kept you on the edge of your seat. It moved along at a pace that was perfect for the text.Not to mention it is so will written. The acting is grand. The characters are bigger than life and the actors chosen for this movie were so believable that I Think that they truly rival their original counterparts.\"', '\"A big budget film, which clearly shows how Bay proves to be one the best action directors of all time. Much better than the first one, Bad Boys 2 it\\'s pure fun, even for it\\'s running time(147 mins), Martin Lawrence gives a better performance than Will Smith, the situations in the film are crazy and funny, Lawrence comments about a couple of rats having sex human style is an excess of bizarre humor. Michael Bay seems to be a Miami fan, but also a great filmmaker, explosions and car chases are impressive and overloaded with dead bodies, flying cars, and village destruction, a great spectacle. The sound is charged with dynamic surround field, which makes Bad Boys 2 an excellent experience, pure fun, pure noise, pure Bay.\"', '\"***Possible Spoilers (though very slight)***This is a fun, \"bubble-gum for the brain\" type movie.  It is a little suspenseful, but for the most part, easy to follow.  I\\'ve not seen the 1960\\'s version of this movie, so I base my opinions on the 2001 version alone.  I thought the casting was great.  And I liked seeing Brad Pitt and Matt Damon in a working relationship.  They have complimentary acting skills.  Of all the (modern) actors out there, I think that Brad Pitt has the widest array of characters, with Matt Damon easily in the top five.  Even though they both play their most tried and true personalities in this movie, I was glad to see them together.  I don\\'t easily buy into the craze, and for a while, I didn\\'t like Brad Pitt or his movies, but after seeing his diversity, he is impossible to ignore!  I am finding the same pattern in Matt Damon.  George Clooney is yet another actor who I thought was riding on his looks, but as it turns out, he is a consistent actor.  I\\'ve not seen him in many varying roles, but he does play this character well.  As always, Julia Roberts is cast as the leading lady, struggling with her plight for control over her destiny, or rather, her autonomy.  Granted, she is the highest paid actress, and one of the three highest paid actors OR actresses in Hollywood, she does her character well.  (Which is probably why she is so high paid).  In Ocean\\'s Eleven, she once again plays her character to a tee.  I felt that the Chemistry between she had Clooney was admirable, though perhaps a little practiced.  And then we have Andy Garcia...a flawless performance, once again.  He consistently plays a wonderful villain-type character, and Terry Benedict is no exception.  I did feel that this film perhaps insulted his intelligence, it was necessary for the progression of the plot.  Overall, I found the movie enjoyable and I would rent it again - if I don\\'t buy it first.\"', '\"I went to see this movie expecting to see a big-budget remake of the original Shaft, and I got it.This version is a lot more violent than the original, it didn\\'t seem to be in Shaft\\'s style. The pacing and editing in the first half of the movie were fast and smooth. John Singleton did a great job in establishing Shaft\\'s character and the plot.  During the second half of the movie (when the action really begins), however, the movie starts to lose it\\'s original slickness.Samuel L. Jackson is truly a great Shaft, he\\'s probably the only actor out there (besides the great Richard Roundtree) who could pull this off, and he does an excellent job.  This time around, though, we don\\'t really see Shaft\\'s \"Ladies\\' Man\" side, except for a couple of innuendoes with minor characters.  Like I said, Jackson\\'s Shaft is a little too violent (even for a desensitized, Tarantino fan like me). Christian Bale, after playing a cold,rich, psychopathic killer in \"American Psycho\", plays a...cold, rich, psychopathic killer.  He\\'s perfect in his ability to make us feel absolutely no compassion for him. It\\'s impossible not to mention Bustah Rhymes in a small but great role as Shaft\\'s driver/assistant.  He provides some of the comic relief, taking some strain off of Jackson.I thoroughly enjoyed Isaac Hayes\\' Oscar-Winning theme, which plays throughout the movie.This Shaft is a great movie for anyone who\\'s a fan of the original, Sam Jackson, or great action movies in general.\"', '\"I went to see this movie thinking that I would have to see MI to understand it.  Well, I didn\\'t and am glad it was so different.  Ethan has really matured in the film.  We get to see a different side of him.  I really enjoyed Thandie Newton.  She is very beautiful and I don\\'t think anyone else could have played her role.  She is a very talented actress.  Ving Rhames is great and so is Anthony Hopkins. I can\\'t believe the negative  reviews of this film.  It is a film that allows you to simply have fun. I give this movie a 10!  I hope they have an MI3!\"', '\"This movie unlike the 1st and 3rd ones is a joyless cash grab, I was only 10 minutes in when I decided I couldn\\'t take it anymore\"', '\"This is based on the  film for the 1960`s with  Frank Sinatra & all his friends, It was a pleasant diversion, The current film is  much better.

It was a good job. Congratulations!\"', '\"The story builds it\\'s crime case well, keeping the mystery element existing while revealing new details and small surprises along the way. Yet it kind of throws back at how the focus character seems to be so resourceful and calm at what he\\'s doing. I think the movie should have a more solid backgrounder on how he can do these things. The action side is not that good at all, having too much close up shots and cuts from shot to shot just don\\'t seem to add to the suspense. The acting side also doesn\\'t really offer something. Samuel L. Jackson\\'s acting is surprisingly slightly a bit his own standard here, grinning too much at the wrong times. Christian Bale\\'s upper lip definitely wrecks up his expressions all the entire time. Vanessa Williams can add a color to the story but that\\'s just it.\"', '\"I was genuinely disappointed by this movie.  The dialog was trite: \"I\\'m not going to lose you...,\" and every Hollywood cliche was employed.  It absolutely lacked any vestige of originality, and some outcomes were so incredibly improbable as to insult one\\'s intelligence.  Unfortunately, due to the hype and the power of the franchise, tickets will sell, and I\\'m afraid others will also leave the theater thinking of many other far better ways to spend $8.\"', '\"OK, action fans out there! You\\'ve been wanting to drag along your romance/drama SO to a martial arts film that he/she will not hate. This is the one.Shanghai Noon is a great comedy first and foremost. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan is amazing, and unlike Rush Hour (which rattled race issues just a little), the inter-cultural humor is tasteful and respectful. Both actors shine in their niches.Unlike many action films (especially Jackie Chan\\'s), this one has a real plot, and while it doesn\\'t exactly have \"something to say that changed my life\", there are satisfying themes, the story is original, and the characters have some depth, while being both a parody of and honoring the western movie genre. This is a hard stunt to pull off.Plus, there is plenty of hand-to-hand combat and fighting. As usual with Jackie Chan, there is virtually no blood or gore -- this is soft, cartoony violence, which is not to imply it\\'s cheesy. Kids will enjoy this film.Who should see this film:-- Action lovers (and drag along your SO)-- People who just plain like comedies. It\\'s worth it.-- Drama lovers or arty types who hate Arnold Schwartzenegger but might like to try an action flick just this one time.I rate Shanghai Noon a 9 out of 10.\"', '\"DAD has to be the worst entry in the history of Bond.This is even more frustrating when the first twenty minutes were so impressive. The entrance into Korea,Moon\\'s ferocious temper and the chase sequence were well done with the notion of Bond being imprisoned for fourteen monthes novel and original. Bond\\'s subsequent arrival in Hong Kong is deftly handled but the movie goes downhill from the moment Bond arrives in Cuba. Halle Berry is completely miscast as Jinx and seems to think she is in an Austin Powers movie.Her publicist trots out the tired old line about Jinx being the first Bond leading lady to equal 007, but in reality almost all of the Bond girls were tough and independent and let down by poor acting...as happens here. The ludicrous invisible car has been the subject of a great deal of criticism but I\\'ll just say that with this level of technology why bother training double 0 agents?anyone could do the job.Star Trek\\'s Mr Scott famously said that he couldn\\'t change the laws of physics but to judge the poorly judged set pieces here apparently Lee Tamahori can. The less said about the effects the better. There are some inspired casting choices from the European /Asian quarter.Rosamund Pike sparkles as Miranda Frost despite being hamstrung by the script and Rachel Grant shows that her first big screen appearance certainly won\\'t be her last. John Cleese is a pleasant surprise I hated his clowning in TWINE but he works well here and establishes a genuine touch of dignity to some very silly scenes. Traditionally the US casting in Bond films is poor and apart from the over rated Halle Berry Michael Madsen phones in a performance that shows why his career consists of z-grade straight to video garbage. Which is basically what DAD is...albeit with a bigger budget.\"', '\"Back in 1997, after the huge success of Independence Day, (A film I will never watch again, it\\'s THAT stupid!) I was not a fan of Will Smith. His television show was annoying to watch, and I didn\\'t like any of his films with the exception of Six Degrees of Seperation to which he tried some dramatic roles and succeded, (Far better than he did with Ali) However, with the original Men In Black, I actually liked Will Smith as his charming personality won me over. I liked the chemestry between Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as secret policemen who protect the Earth from the scum of the universe.Now it\\'s five years later, and both Smith and Jones put their black suits back on for more alien busting in Men In Black II. Now while the sequel doens\\'t have the freshness of the first film, it has a lot more action and I actually liked the action packed ending more than the slow finale of the first film. Smith and Jones are a joy to watch and I\\'m sure America will be watching Men In Black sequels as long as they continue to make money at the box office. (Please, Will, don\\'t make an Independence Day sequel, though, that movie was awful!)In any case Men In Black II is a funny film, that while not as original or fresh as the first film, it does have a lot more energy than the first one does.7 on a scale of 1-10.\"', '\"This movie was true to the TV series. Any fan of the original should enjoy this one.Charlie\\'s Angels was fun to watch, and didn\\'t take itself too seriously. The dialog was full of innuendo, puns, and quotes (both from the series and elsewhere). The nods to previous movies, especially prison movies, kept me looking for the next reference, and added to the hilarity. The Angels were just that: great looking, sexy, strong and independent women.This unbelievable story is unbelievably enjoyable.\"', '\"The mission impossible movie after the first one but before the third one.\"', '\"While not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, the original \"Men in Black\" was a lighthearted, entertaining vehicle smoothly carried by the repartee between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.  This debacle, however, bears little resemblance to the 1997 crowdpleaser.Let me begin by assuring you that liking the first movie by no means guarantees that you will enjoy MIB 2.  That was certainly not the case for me.  The pacing was terrible, the plot pathetic, and the jokes are set up in a haphazard, rushed manner, giving the impression that the director was handed a script containing too many jokes, and of a poor quality!, and attempted to cram them all into an 82 minute running time.  The original was fresh, and the actors seemed to be having fun, but here Tommy Lee Jones looks depressed, not as part of his character, but as if he is aware of the terrible quality of the production and is merely waiting until he can go home for the day.  Will Smith tries his best, but laden with an asinine script and poor direction, he cannot help failing.  As other users have commented, the plot is nonsensical and painful.  I understand that the plot is secondary in films like this, and in fact am a fairly major Jackie Chan fan, so I honestly would not have minded if everything else had fallen into place.  What\\'s more, whereas the original film\\'s humor was almost entirely clean, the sequel finds it necessary to riddle the script with tasteless sex jokes.  I\\'m not a prude, and I did not object to the risque \"humor\" because it was vulgar, but because it was truly boring.This movie\\'s greatest sin, though, is that it exemplifies all that is wrong with filmmaking today: it is a big budget, overly slick, ultimately cynical and heartless film that plays to the lowest common denominator  and laughs all the way to the bank.  I\\'m not knocking populist entertainment, but this piece of filth insults the intelligence and makes one yearn for filmmaking lacking in polish but teeming with heart and wit.  Only people willing to pay the admission price to see the trailer for \"The Two Towers\" (which was infinitely better than MIB 2), have a valid reason to see this dreck. My rating: 1/10.\"', '\"Sam L Jackson plays john shaft the nephew of the original shaft who even appears in the film. I haven\\'t seen the original shaft movie so I don\\'t know witch one is better but this version is certainly good. Samuel plays john shaft a tough but cool detective who is out to stop a racist killer played well by Christian bale who is also working for a Latino gangster and drug lord. With the help from his friends shaft will stop at nothing to enforce justice. ghetto films are not normally My kind of film but I really enjoyed shaft it was a fun and well crafted film Samuel does a good performance as ultra cool john shaft and Christian bale makes a good villain even Busta Ryhmes is good as a sort of comic relief character.Direction is done well by John Singleton and good action makes shaft an enjoyable ride 7 out of ten\"', '\"Will and Marcus back a second time round and it\\'s probably the best of the franchise.Morgue scene brilliant.Marcus on ecstasy hilarious.The big gun fight in the Cuban mansion at the end absolute carnage.Syd is gorgeous also, What is Mike Lowrey thinking not wifing that!\"', '\"Beauty agents three people line, very hot female charm, confident beauty everyone loves\\nAlthough logic is unreliable\"', '\"Without a doubt, John Woo saved this movie from being another \"Tom Cruise\" scenery chewing vehicle like the first MI.For the record, I couldn\\'t stand the first Mission Impossible movie.  As a longtime fan of the original series, it was extremely disappointing in that it had no \"style\" - simply a hacked-together mess of action sequences.With the new movie, you have to understand and acknowledge that Woo has a trademark action style that you either love, or hate.  I think it worked very well in MI2.I\\'ll say right out that I\\'m not a Tom Cruise fan, however he WAS good in this movie - this is the movie that the last Bond movie should\\'ve been.Who could end a MI-2 review without a note about the remarkable Thandie Newton, who I havn\\'t seen before this feature.  This girl is talented! Besides being absolutely, stunningly beautiful, she IS a very talented actress who I\\'m sure is now well on her way to super-stardom.  (I love her British accent as well - certainly adds an elegant, playful style to her character)!\"', '\"Not only this movie features Tom Cruise, but along with the face goes a five+ star film.  The plot is way to predicable, but instead of an original plot the scriptwriter decided to personalize the film by adding suspense, a lot of violence, and some humor and romance.  Even when I loved M:I 2, I do not think that Cruise deserved those 70 million dollars because it seems that he acted only for fourty minutes at the most, leaving the rest for a stunt and a computer.\"', '\"I think that the director has done a great job and well placed that\\'s why this film has done well internationally.I like the performance of both Morgan Freeman and Ben Affleck both together in one film had a great impact on audiences and Jerry Goldsmith is a very unique and outstanding composer. This film is a combination of action thriller and politically suspense and high octane.This film is worth watching for and highly recommended for those who like to watch action politically thriller film.And this film worth buying DVD and watch again and again.Heart pounding suspense from start to end with good direction.Hats Off.\"', '\"When I went to go see MIB 2, I had very high expectations. Fortunately, those expectations were met! Just as in the first one, funny man Will Smith and veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones are perfect together on the big screen. Of course they could not come together if it were not for Barry Sonnenfeld who directed this picture with a vivid imagination and great special effects. A recent member commented that the worms were as annoying as hemmoroids which is not true, the worms actually make the movie even funnier as does Frank the Pug. To sum it up, Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones star in a movie that will definitely amuse people for years to come! I give it a 10 out of 10!\"', '\"Bad Boys 2 lives beyond its predecessor in all shapes and sizes. Mind-blowing action, non stop excitement and barrelled fuelled comedy are all present and correct in this blazing kick-ass action comedy served from Michael Bay (Transformers.) Bad Boys is from start to finish a rip-roaring, bone crunching, and ass-cracking thrill ride. Smith and Lawrence deliver their best performances yet in a film that will have you laughing right to the end. The story is simple. Its about two Narcotics cops who are made to bring down a Cuban drug Kingpin who is flowing large amounts of ecstasy into Miami. Things start to go weird as Lowrey (Smith and Burnett (Lawrence) realise that the kingpin starts to control not only the flow of ecstasy but also starts drug trafficking.This IS entertainment at its blistering best.\"', '\"I must say that I have never had so much fun at an action movie! Based on the trailers and TV spots, I was expecting major cheese, but I went home happy (and if it hadn\\'t cost me $7.25, I would have seen it again!)The movie version of the television series, which is now a cult classic, is explosive. The humor is satirical, taking advantage of the corny elements of the original series. The action sequences were incredible, but not too much (see MI:2), and added to the storyline instead of overpowering it.Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Lui all were fantastic in their roles. You couldn\\'t help but falling in love with each angel. Take down your Farrah posters, its time for the new girl. Bill Murray was funny as always, and Charlie had one great voice!Don\\'t miss out on seeing this film in the theater. I\\'m not an action fan, but I loved this movie. Can\\'t wait for the DVD!\"', '\"The 20th film makes the 40th anniversary since the debut of dr no back in 1962 James Bond mission this time around has him investigating colonel moon who is smuggling African conflict diamonds. After a chase ensures, bond is captured and tortured for 14 months. This brings a different change to the films since it is one of the rare times bond is caught rather than getting away like he usually does, bond eventually gets released and wants revenge for the betrayal. Being the 40th anniversary and all, it does pay homage to previous bond films with past gadgets make a return and references to the previous films. John Cleese takes over the q role after Desmond Llewelyn passing offscreen after the release of the world is not enough. One of the more positive aspects of the film, is the growing mother and son type bond between m and James. A nice little moment between James and moneypenny happens. However a slight critical moment is the excessive issue of cgi while decent but feels like it distracts from the story. This is pierce Bronson final performance in the role which is too bad but he does to show his age a little but still believable in the role. Halle berry pays homage to a classic scene from dr no. Madonna cameos as a fencing instructor and provided the theme song.\"', '\"The movie\\'s concept is great and the character interaction is pretty good, but seeing as one of the goals of the heist was for Danny Ocean to get the attention of Julia Roberts\\' character, I felt it would have been a stronger movie if we had known more about their history.  Why did they divorce in the first place?  As the movie was, there was really no point in her character being there!  I didn\\'t \"believe\" his motivation.  Entertaining movie otherwise.\"', '\"Don\\'t walk out too soon, like I almost did. It\\'s a long, slow set-up, but worth the wait.Not much chemistry, nor continuity in the beginning, with some rather odd camera work on the big-name stars: In one long scene, Julia Robert\\'s upper lip grows as large as the screen, while another shot highlights an unflattering crease beneath Brad Pitt\\'s eye, and again, a prolonged shot of George Clooney\\'s very flat face in profile. I have no idea what was trying to be expressed by this, but it was all very curious. It reminded me of Brad Pitt wearing brown contact lenses in the 12 Monkeys so he wouldn\\'t, what? -- look so durn cute.A fun ride -- worth the wait.\"', '\"The story is simple enough, get Russia and U.S. into a raving frenzy and kill each other while the third party watch from behind. The problem about the third party plot which stands enough to benefit from U.S. and Russia killing each other just doesn\\'t add up in the movie, since we do not know how the third party stand to benefit anything.Most wars are actually created to benefit the larger richer nations for some economic benefit, either oil companies, gain of control of land, lots of gold, oil, etc. In this case it is pure hostility plain and simple. Take for instance U.S. takeover of Iraq, with Saddam out of the way, the oil are no longer selling in Eurodollars, that would straighten U.S. dollars. With Taliban out of the way in Afghanistan, the oil pipeline deal was much easily built without paying anything to the Taliban (court case on payment is still pending in Texas). With the E. Timor being an independent nation from Indonesia, oil concessions now belong to the U.S., I can go on and on. But for a Third party to stand to benefit is a weak plot - now you really have to convince me on that. I am not that smart. If the writers are determined to go this direction, then convince me why they are doing what they do. Hitler\\'s dead, so what\\'s the deal for the Neo-Nazis? If Russia, or U.S. have some kind of an economic benefit unbeknownst to the public, the story would be more believable. Even the ending of the movie was somewhat hilarious for me as it really reminded me of Godfather Part II. I would die laughing (thank god they didn\\'t do that) if they shot a gun through the eye while in the massage parlor. But hey, car bomb explosion Godfather style was funny already. I mean a tyrannical crime of this size, I think should be decided by world court or something for the public to see, not Al Pacino style murder.Even the idea of putting bombs in a stadium was truly not a creative act of terrorism - reminds me of Bruce Willis\\' Boy Scout. Now, most terrorism are quite creative, grant you the anthrax mail or hitting commercial airlines on World Trade Center. These things are totally unexpected, which is how acts of terrorism exists.And looking back at Tsunamis, an act of terrorism in creating tsunami\\'s is in my book would be quite creative. Imagine a line of fault under the water of Marianne Island off the Atlantic Ocean, using a conventional cheap underwater missile or underwater detonation to trigger the most massive Tsunamis in the history of mankind causing 500 foot waves traveling at near speed of sound hitting and destroying the entire eastern Coast of U.S.A. destroying totally Washington D.C, New York, etc. Could it be, in a movie that this act of terrorism is already being done using a conventional bomb under the water in S.E. Asia? Destroying an economy is easy, and the fact that there is a possibility that S.E. Asia has the world\\'s largest oil reserve (at least that\\'s what I\\'ve heard) from South of Asia all the way to Brunei, is something a movie can look at, from an a Hollywood point of view. I am not promoting any conspiracy theories here.Sorry to nit pick, perhaps I am not smart as most of the critics who watched this movie and for this I apologize. I rate this movie 3/10. If you want a more believable movie I recommend the classic Dr. Strangelove. It is funny, and the scenarios and the plots are quite solid and I rate that movie 9/10.\"', '\"I was not a fan of the TV series \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" and I doubt I ever saw an episode.  What seems funny about that is that now I know more about the show than I ever did, thanks to the movie.  If there were stupid plot points, lots of jiggling in teeny costumes which change by the second, and explosions, then the movie followed its inspiration closely. There was several laugh-out loud scenes, some very boring scenes and a lot of things that go boom for those impressed with that. I like Lucy Liu the best of the Angels and my favorite scene involved Drew in danger of getting killed in a penthouse apartment. Something about the way it was photographed made the scene stand out, I can\\'t explain it totally but it seemed very different from everything else. Nice that the girls found time for their guys, and for Tom Green too.\"', '\"I really liked this one better than the original,, the original was good but this is soo much better. the action sequences super slo-mo the Woo-ism\\'s,, John Woo kicks ass. Tom Cruise is at it again as he is trying to stop a deadly disease from being sold on the black market and infecting the entire world,, he goes up against Dougray Scott who plays the bad guy,, Thandie Newton wasn\\'t bad to look at either,, Anthony Hopkins plays Jim Phelps,, wish he would have had more screen time. and Ving Rhames is at his usual witty best,, I loved all of the action scenes, especially the flying motorcycle scene at the end,, the music kicked butt too especially Metalicca\\'s I Disappear.. excellent movie, great direction,, great music,, and lo\\'ts of John Woo classic hand to hand action, and stunts, with super slo mo..\"', '\"Because we need to see it first, in order to start hating it :)\\nIf you hate that someone doesn\\'t like that and expressing themselves on this site - don\\'t open this site anymore or even, don\\'t use the internet :)))\"', '\"Die Another Day is great for the first hour (approx), but when Bond goes to the Ice Palace, it becomes \"good\".It is here that the story gets a bit squashed - lot happens in a short amount of time (including the traditional Bond car chase). After that, the film is great again. The final battle is very good but could do with a little less Halle Berry. But, to be fair to her, she was a lot less anoying than I feared she would be.Another thing I was a little weary of was the invisible car but, again, I didn\\'t find it that bad. I respect Lee Tamahori\\'s style of direction and his slightly different approach to a Bond film but towards the end of the movie, he gets a little carried away with the \"bullet-time/Matrix style\" movements. In the big picture, it\\'s still a Bond movie and doesn\\'t, by any means, ruin the series. James Bond WILL Return!!!\"', '\"We liked this sequel more than MI-1.  It was so fast, sexy, intense, creative (THE STUNTS!) and full of action it would be worth seeing again because we know things got missed.The Stunts alone are worth it.  How they do all that is amazing. Combinations of Matrix and other movies.  All done to perfection and Edited with crisp style and smooth too.  John Woo at his best.Not a very new story but some new twists on how Bio-engineering and Germ Warfare could lead to.  Tom was great and everyone else played their parts very well too.  Anthony Hopkins was good but under-used. \\nChemistry was good enough to make Nicole take a second look but Tom is still her man.Recommend you see it.\"', '\"The first Bond film of the 21st century, Lee Tamahori\\'s \\'Die Another Day\\' was the last to star Pierce Brosnan. Bond is on a mission in North Korea to nail terrorist \\'Colonel Moon\\' ( Will Yun Lee ). He is betrayed, captured, tortured and imprisoned for 14 months. Swapped with another terrorist - Zao ( Rick Yune ) - Bond is told by M ( Judi Dench ) that his usefulness as an agent is at an end. He escapes from MI6 custody, and heads off to a Cuban gene replacement therapy clinic. He later discovers that Moon - whom he had previously believed to be deceased - has changed himself into the Richard Branson-like entrepreneur \\'Gustav Graves\\' ( Toby Stephens ). Bond goes to Iceland where Graves has his headquarters - a fantastic ice palace - and at his disposal is a laser satellite system called \\'Icarus\\'...As 9/11 had only occurred a year before, it was decided to make \\'Day\\' more of an escapist fantasy than the other Brosnan Bonds. They got it badly wrong. It starts off well enough ( though Bond\\'s torture incorporated into the opening titles is a little bizarre! ), but once in London turns into a pseudo-Roger Moore film, replete with outrageous ideas such as an invisible car! It is like watching the first half of \\'From Russia With Love\\' grafted on to the second half of \\'Diamonds Are Forever\\'. \\'Day\\' is the only Brosnan Bond to lack script involvement from Bruce Feirstein - and it shows. Neal Purvis & Robert Wade\\'s screenplay has all the subtlety and finesse of their \\'Johnny English\\' farces. The perceived over-reliance on C.G.I. was criticised - most notably Bond para-gliding through icebergs. Toby Stephens\\'s sneering \\'Graves\\' is like \\'Flashman\\' out of \\'Tom Brown\\'s Schooldays\\', and could have been a great villain but the weak script lets him down. Halle Berry\\'s \\'Jinx\\' is a bland clone of \\'Lara Croft\\' ( it is hard to believe she almost landed her own spin-off movie ), while Rosamund Pike\\'s \\'Miranda Frost\\' is beautiful but uninteresting. Among the action sequences are a pre-titles hovercraft chase, Bond fencing with Graves, a pursuit across icy landscapes involving 007\\'s Aston Martin, and the destruction of the ice palace. The finale looks as though the writers looked at the climax of \\'The Living Daylights\\' ( 1987 ), and imagined they could do better.As 2002 was an anniversary year, it was decided to litter \\'Day\\' with references to past-Bond films, many are forced and contrived. M16 is using a deserted London underground station as a base, and Bond gets to see again old gadgets such as the \\'Thunderball\\' jet pack and Rosa Klebb\\'s spiked shoe. John Cleese takes over full-time as \\'Q\\', though this would ultimately be his final appearance in the role.\\'Day\\' is good entertainment on the whole ( I loved the ice palace. It evokes memories of the heyday of Ken Adam ), but the shift in tone makes it wildly uneven. The Madonna theme song ought not to have been used, ditto her cameo as a fencing instructor. Though the film was massively successful at the box office, it was widely perceived not to have worked - four years passed before Bond was seen again. Brosnan, the man who, only seven years before, had been hailed in some quarters as \\'the definitive Bond\\', was not asked to return. His advancing years ( he was 49 when it was made ) and competition from other franchises such as the \\'Jason Bourne\\' films ended his tenure as 007. The biggest ever shake-up in Bond\\'s cinematic world was about to happen...\"', '\"This was a pretty damn good movie. I liked just about everything about it. It has almost everything you go to the movies for...comedy, action, crime, romance, but not that much drama- oh well. I really enjoyed the cleverness of the Oceans Eleven Team that they used to try to get the money. The only thing that I didnt like about this movie was the ending because you didnt know what happened!! But other than that I really enjoyed the cast, all wonderfully casted and gifted. Familiar faces are also seen within the movie. Ocean\\'s Eleven...pretty damn good.\"', '\"Not good, a puny copy of the first one. Sorry guys and girls. Yes men in black are cool, this movie is not. The story is thin, very thin. The effects are noting impressive. The only thing lifting the movie is Will Smith as agent J, but any movie with Will Smith in it would probably give the audiance some laughs.\"', '\"The Matrix has spawned the most imitated and copied special effects in history that this movie could\\'ve been the sequel...and that\\'s not saying much. The fight sequences we\\'re so fake I had lost my will to give it a shot.  As a martial artist, I was insulted by the \"Hollywood training\" the actresses received.  They looked terrible.  Outside of the action, well, that\\'s all there was...no story.  Jacqueline Smith...you we\\'re the best!\"', '\"This movie lost me in the first five minutes.  I think that\\'s a record.  How did it do it?  (If revealing the \"teaser\" can be considered a spoiler, then SPOILER ALERT)We start with a lone Israeli jet carrying a nuclear bomb over Sinai during the 1973 war, just in case Israeli forces are overwhelmed.  While the pilot is fussing with a picture of his wife and child, a SAM is launched and the plane is downed.  Years later, Bedouins dig it out of the sand.a.  It takes about six minutes for a jet to fly from Tel Aviv to Cairo.  The Israelis wouldn\\'t have launched a jet with a bomb unless they planned to blow up Cairo for real. b.  There would have been an entire squadron protecting the plane. c.  No Israeli pilot -- or any fighter pilot in any air force -- would be fussing with photos of his wife while flying. d.  The Israelis owned Sinai for years.  If they lost a jet with a nuclear weapon, you don\\'t think they\\'d be damn sure they found it before they handed Sinai back to Egypt? e.  Russia is chock full of nuclear weapons and underpaid soldiers guarding them.  It couldn\\'t have come from there?  The rest of the movie is the same.  Cool visuals, story makes no sense. Hard to care when the storytellers don\\'t.\"', '\"Good build up but this thriller is not always thrilling.  There is one good sequence that is tense, but it is hard to care about the characters.  The relationship with the girlfriend was lame.  Overall pretty average.\"', '\"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Although it obviously exaggerated the street racing scene, The Fast and the Furious presented a refreshingly different type of movie. The engine sounds were so real and sensory that I felt like I was really there. And the cinematography was especially well done (the scene with the train where the film built to a crescendo). Perhaps its the dank greens, but I really got a rush from seeing this film!Go see this flick!\"', '\"This movie was just plain a disappointment. Thin plot, contrived action and the only redeeming thing was Thandie Newton, and if you want to see here in a REAL role, check out Beloved. Now THAT was a Thandie Newton movie.  The action is gratuitious, and unless you are a kung fu student, will be boring. I would recommend you do not waste your money on this sleeper.\"', '\"This is my all time favorite excellent sequel buddy cop gunplay action flick I love it to death. It is Michael Bay\\'s underrated excellent sequel! This is a prototypical \"good\" action movie -- intense, perfectly executed, it is original action, shown to the tune of a unforgettable following story from the first movie with a gunplay\\'s fanatic dreams. The score to this movie I would give (for you) for Bad-Boys II a 6.6. To action junkies, this movie is an easy 9, because the only thing that really matters is that the action is superb and the other elements, if not stellar, don\\'t detract enough from the action to really make a difference.Splitting the difference, I am giving an 8/10 -- a good score.Bad Boys II (2003) is Michael Bay second installment in the Bad Boys franchise that first movie from the 90\\'s become a classic buddy cop action flick. I went to see this movie in the movie theater in 2003 when it come out. I loved the first movie so much, that I hoped so much that there would be a sequel to this awesome movie flick and 8 years later my hopes were answered. I got this movie on Blu-ray and re watching this movie again I still absolutely love it, since the first time I watched it in the movie theater. There is action violence, some drug content, and some tiny bit of sexuality but still this movie got 8 awards and was the best action movie in 2003. This is one of Michael Bay\\'s best action films. So in conclusion if anybody like teenagers, or adults want to see this movie then I think this a great movie for them if their interested in action movie. Plot: Narcotics cops Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) head up a task force investigating the flow of ecstasy into Miami. Their search leads to a dangerous kingpin Johnny Tapia (Jordi MollÃ\\xa0), whose plan to control the city\\'s drug traffic has touched off an underground war. Meanwhile, things get sexy between Mike and Syd (Gabrielle Union), Marcus\\'s sister.Michael Bay returns as director and the film finds Miami detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) battling Haitian and Cuban drug runners. The film\\'s cast includes Joe Pantoliano and Gabrielle Union. It may have taken 8 years to reunite the Bad Boys, but it was well worth it as Martin Lawrence and Will Smith go balls to the walls in this roller coaster ride of a sequel. Director Michael Bay leaves nothing unearthed as the bullets fly and bodies fall. The chase sequence on the Miami bridge is worth the price of admission alone.Gabrielle Union as Special DEA Agent Sydney \"Syd\" Burnett, did a wonderful, brilliant and outstanding job portraying Marcus sister. I am happy that we see Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) in relationship with Syd and that we meet Marcus (Martin Lawrence) sister for the first time. She was never mentioned before in the first movie and we never know about his family. Mike Lorey was an only child and his parents were rich. Watch out for the scene where Marcus accidentally drinks two pills of ecstasy and get\\'s high in Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano)\\'s house and does a funny scenes, it is hilarious. The sequel is one of the most technically perfect action movies of all time. The set-pieces are jaw dropping and the freeway chase is one of greatest car chases in cinema history. Real stunts, real explosions and arguably the most over the top casual brutality in a mainstream action movie. Bodies flying out of trucks, then being decapitated, it\\'s all right here.There are the wildest car chase scenes put all over the film, there isn\\'t only one scene there are more car scenes. There are cars crashes, explosions and destroyed motor vehicles, you see them a lot in a perfect stunt vehicle. There is a rescue mission when Marcus\\'s sister (Gabrielle Union) is kidnapped Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence), along with their voluntary S.W.A.T. team and Syd\\'s DEA co-workers, prepare a military assault to rescue Syd from Tapia\\'s home.There are a lot of handguns and automatic weapons used in this movie and they are used well, we see a lot of shootouts, watch out for slo- motion on the end of scene where Syd throws Lowrey\\'s other Glock 17, yet Burnett appears with a Glock, he makes a flip from the mine filed, the mine is a decoy and shoots Tapia right in the head between the eyes, the ending is very climatic action perfectly executed on a mine field. The problem: movie is way too long but the action is so spectacular and pace so relentless that you\\'ll be caught up until the end credits. The movie is about 30 minutes too long, clocking in at a whopping 2 and a half hours which is definitely overkill. You\\'ll never be bored though as it rockets along at a great pace. I love Bad Boys I and II to death! Technically speaking, the movie is not perfect. I would give it a 9. As it stands, I give it: 8/10.Bad Boys II is a 2003 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and starring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. A sequel to the 1995 film Bad Boys and the second installment in the Bad Boys series.8/10 Score: B Studio: Columbia Pictures Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Jordi MollÃ\\xa0, Gabrielle Union, Peter Stormare, Theresa Randle, Joe Pantoliano, Otto Sanchez, Jon Seda Director: Michael Bay Producer: Jerry Bruckheimer Screenplay: Ron Shelton, Jerry Stahl Story by Ron Shelton, Cormac Wibberley, Marianne Wibberley Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hr. 27 Mins.

It does truly well with all kind ofpyrotechnics and flips, but there\\'s a reason that fireworksshows don\\'t last over two hours. It gets boring. The plot hadno coherence, no attempt to make sense of the dilemmasthat needed solving, so there was no tension in learning ifthey could be or how they would be solved. It came out  flatand humorless. And as often happens when folks take themselves deeply seriously, the dialog has all been heardmany times before, and wasn\\'t particularly good the firsthalf dozen times. I did perk up to realize the girl lead\\'scharacter was named Nordoff Hall, like the authors of theMutiny on the Bounty trilogy. I have no idea why they did that,but it was fun to see. Probably they were loads of littleEaster eggs like that scattered through the story, but it wasso doggone soporific my attention wandered.  I just couldn\\'ttake another loooooooooong extennnnnnnnnnded romaaaaaaaannntic shot substituting intense gaze for human life.But the people were better looking than mostsoap opera folks, the cars were fast, the flames were billowing, so really, it wasn\\'t toooooooooooooooooo bad.\"', '\"I was looking forward to this movie as its the 40th anniversary Bond film and the last notable anniversary threw up the superb Living Daylights. Unfortunately threw up is the apt term for DAD which is a hideous mess. Brosnan,never more than a competent actor,is onhe of the highlights of the movie.Which says more about the other actors than it does about him. From the opening gunbarrel which now has a CGI bullet in it to Madonna\\'s hideous title song by way of a poorly staged surfing scene and a hovercraft chase that would disgrace the A Team its Bond by numbers. Things improve briefly in Hong Kong and Cuba until the arrival of Halle Berry.Every line her character utters is an excruciating double entendre and she shows her disappointmant but voicing them in a ludicrous little girl lost voice.This is an Oscar winner??? There are a couple of decent set pieces but they are lost in a flurry of bizarre characters,overblown action scenes and most notably Christian Wagner\\'s vainglorious and annoying editing. Lee Tamahori should hang his head in shame.\"', '\"When I went to see MI2 i had the first movie in mind, which was a mistake. The first one had an interesting plot, espionage, intrigue, suspense and charicters who seemed somewhat realistic.   The second one replaced these aspects of the movie with some well done action sequences.  Everything that the Mission: Impossible was Mission: Impossible 2 was not.  The action sequences actually made sense in the first one, where as in Mission: Impossible 2 it was obvious that the plot was constructed as to fit around the action sequences.  On the whole, where Mission: Impossible was a smart espionage movie, Mission: Impossible 2 is a clone of some of the new cheesey James Bond flicks.If mindless action is your thing, you\\'ll want to see Mission: Impossible 2, but if you like a plot to go along with good action, just rent Mission: Impossible.\"', '\"Since 1962, Jackie Chan has appeared in over 70 films in China, but until recently, he was virtually unknown to most U.S. audiences.  He has always been well known among those who enjoy martial arts and he is famous in those circles as the daredevil actor who does all his own stunts, some of which have been wildly dangerous.However, Chan has always transcended his martial arts confinements, because besides being a talented martial arts athlete and stuntman, he is also an excellent comedian.  He is a master of physical comedy who has often been compared with Buster Keaton, whom he idolizes.  Now that he is learning to speak English, he is sure to become a big hit in the states.`Shanghai Noon\\' along with his smash hit `Rush Hour\\' (grossing $141 Million at the box office) have marked a turning point in his career.  The emphasis in both films is on Jackie Chan the comedian rather than Jackie Chan the stuntman and karate expert.  Sure, there are numerous scenes where he frenetically subdues a dozen or so thugs while climbing up walls and somersaulting through the air, but these action scenes are far sparser and less spectacular than in his Chinese films.`Shanghai Noon\\' didn\\'t do as well at the box office (still a respectable $55 Million) as `Rush Hour\\', but it was actually the better film.  Chan is clearly the star in this film whereas he was overshadowed by Chris Tucker\\'s outrageousness in `Rush Hour\\'.  Despite its insubstantial story, a sendup of American Westerns with a side order of Chinese, this film is a good showcase for Chan\\'s broad range of talents, especially his physical comedy.Owen Wilson adds a wry note to the film by creating a bank robber that is as out of place in the American West as an Asian cowboy.  Wilson plays his part like a California surfer who has recently completed a set of Tony Robbins tapes.  He is so incongruous to his surroundings that almost everything he does is funny.Though not a superlative film, `Shanghai Noon\\' is entertaining and funny and worth seeing for light comedic entertainment.  I rated it a 7/10.  It continues to establish Jackie Chan as a comedic force to be reckoned with, and from whom we are likely to get much great entertainment in the future.\"', '\"George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Shaobo Qin, Miguel Perez, and Livingston Dell make up \"Ocean\\'s Eleven,\" a 2001 film directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film also stars Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts. This is a remake of the rat pack \"Ocean\\'s Eleven,\" which I\\'ve never seen so I can\\'t make comparisons. I suspect that this version has more emphasis on plot and the older one has more emphasis on the pack.The mastermind of a plot to rob Las Vegas\\' Bellaggio Hotel vault of $160 million is Danny Ocean, a very recent ex-con who had lots of time on his hands in prison to plan it. With the help of his buddy, Rusty Ryan (Pitt) he recruits 9 people who specialize in a particular expertise to carry out the elaborate heist. Problems come in when Ocean, obsessed with his ex-wife (Roberts), approaches her, to the annoyance of her present boyfriend, the owner of the hotel, Terry Benedict (Garcia). He \"makes\" Danny by sending out a bulletin with Danny\\'s photo to the hotel staff, which puts him out of his own plot at the insistence of Rusty. But Danny isn\\'t one to exit easily, in either marriage or robberies.This is a fast-paced, tension-filled, exciting movie that\\'s highly entertaining. The plot is completely improbable so you have to take it for what it is - fantastic fun. And you never know whether something is going wrong or if it\\'s part of the plan. The chemistry between the actors, particularly Clooney and Pitt, is great, and there is some wonderful acting. Clooney is solid as Ocean, a passionate man of quiet determination; Damon is terrific as an insecure participant; Don Cheadle, sporting a Cockney accent, is hilarious as an explosives expert; Elliot Gould is outrageous as their financial backer; Carl Reiner is excellent as an older con man who can do accents. Just as they all contribute their different talents to the heist, they do so in this movie. This includes the acting in the smaller roles played by Bernie Mac et al - everyone is perfect. Andy Garcia is fabulous as Benedict - both elegant and scary, he whispers instead of shouts and stays in control for the most part. Megastar Roberts is wasted - she doesn\\'t have much to do.Any actress could have done the role, but I guess the producers wanted an all-star cast.Highly recommended for blockbuster entertainment value and star power. Just don\\'t look for it to be realistic.\"', '\"This is why:1.) Great Script. Awesome Plot. Once again, those WGA guys have done a real great jorb here.2.) Great Directing. McG is one of the most talented directors around, but he truly did perform superhumanly strong here!3.) Great Soundtrack. Just check it out!4.) Great Acting. Cameron Diaz doing great as always. very strong Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu just awesome! Bill Murray not as strong as expected from a guy outta his league, but still great. Luke Wilson was awesome, I think he would have deserved at least a Golden Globe for that.5.) Great Girls! I mean, seriously, check those girls out! CHECK EM OUT!This movie is hottest ever!P. S.: Check my site out! Seriously, check it out!\"', '\"Certainly fast and when it is, it is very entertaining, but when it isn\\'t it\\'s pretty typical of Hollywood. The drama in the film is very cliche. But finally a film promoted as rev-head film that actually has cars that chase and run and crash and drive underneath trucks, unlike a very disappointing Dominic Sena film I can think of. 7/10\"', '\"Mission: Impossible II is sometimes unfairly criticized, for being a sequel to Mission: Impossible, instead of a compliment to it such as the first two parts of the Godfather trilogy. But it is a sequel to Mission: Impossible, so that alone is unfair, and in its own way it does compliment the original.The real problem with the film is that the plot, although quite well developed and effective, is too similar to the first Mission: Impossible and too predictable. I saw Mission: Impossible and Mission: Impossible II in reverse order, so for me the plot was new, and when I saw the first installment later, I was a little disappointed. To me, that says that the film itself is not that flawed, but its downfall is in the fact that it is a sequel, and everyone had seen it already.However, its a fun film to watch, although its not very relaxing as you have to keep watching carefully right from the beginning so as not to miss the plot. The stunts arent bad, and Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott and Ving Rhames are all on top form. Thandie Newton doesnt convince me.The verdict is dont go out of your way to avoid this film, but dont go too far out of your way to see it. If you didnt like the first one, you arent going to like this. 7/10.\"', '\"After 2 misfires, Bond is back with a vengeance. In fact \"Die Another Day\" seems to try too hard at times to make up for the last 2. But it is exactly what you expect (and want) from 007. It gives you your $9 worth. Halle Berry is a welcome edition, but Rosamund Pike as the other femme fatale is a real surprise and Toby Stephens and Rick Yune give you a pair of the best villains since \"Goldfinger\". It features one of the best sword fights in movie history. The stunts are excellent except for one embarassingly fake looking ice water surf sailing scene. There is a very moving scene with \"M\" (Judi Dench) and John Cleese finally finds the right tone as \"Q\". There are few surprises but for what they are they a real kick. This Bond feels energized. The sets are cool, the women are hot and it is a real pleasure to watch.\"', '\"I think that tom cruise and john woo are an excellent teamthe cruiser should make way more action movies it really suits him to do them especially with woo. Mi-2 is non stop action: double-guns, motorbike chases and fistfights. i dont think there is anything majorly wrong with the plot. mi-2 is better then the first one but i only say that because im an action junkie. the rock climbing scene is the best ive seen. respect to the cruiser for doing all his own stunts!by the way the matrix is nothing like mi-2!    at all!9/10\"', '\"This had NO script, no story, no coherence and nothing to keep you awake in between the average action sequences.

First ten minutes are pretty cool. Showdown is also pretty cool.They\\'re pulling their punches in the fighting scenes, it\\'s just not the violent ballet that I know and love.Maybe my expectations were too high from watching the preview, which pretty much shows all the action, from beginning to end.The plot is pretty much non-existent. You expect a movie of this caliber to have twists and turns. The most twisting it does is when some character pulls a mask off. Intelligent? Not really. Not at all, actually. What\\'s up with those masks, anyway? This isn\\'t the sixties, you know.The actors did a pretty good job, both hero and villain. Heroine also passes, as does Hopkins. The rest you can pretty much just forget about.Verdict: Too little action, and the little there is just isn\\'t mind blowing. Too many masks.\"', '\"Why do they make movies like this?

I mean I didn\\'t want to watch some street guys while they are challenging on the streets against the law . There were so many stupid racing scenes with this stupid shooting . Vin Diesel again in one very strong performance . His appearance was the best part of the movie but it looks that he can\\'t improve whole movie . There are also frivolous fighting scenes with Asian gangs . Last scene with \"gripping\" racing was maybe good but not so much exciting to make some real action movie . There were so many faults in making this movie but I can say that in the other hand movie is looking good . There are some scenes with some stupid sense for excitement .

Oprah was working for PM Magazine at the time.In June 1979, it was my suggestion for Mary Hart to host, \"Entertainment Tonight.\"  The actress Jane Seymour was in the room that day.In 1980, I won an Academy Award accepted by Jane Seymour, Jessica Lange, and Rachel Ward.Enough about my background.I was driving along Beltline, and pulled in regarding the DVD or Video of the James Bond movie, \"Die Another Day.\"At Hollywood Video, \"Die Another Day\" was prominantly on display, in alphabetical order, under \"D\" for \"Die Another Day.\"At that Blockbuster, \"Die Another Day\" was under \"B\" for \"Bond, James Bond,\" or something.The door on the south side of the Hollywood Video, with a handicapped ramp, looked like a handicapped entrance to me.  I walked to that door, and it was locked.  I suggested to the management, that that door should be open, unlocked during business hours.  The store manager, Robel Negash, refused, saying that the only reason why the handicap ramp is there is because that door is a \"Fire EXIT,\" and not an \"entrance.\"I encourage motion picture industry professionals to drive by, and see if it looks like a handicapped entrance from the street to you, as well.At the Blockbuster, I went to use their computer to apply for a postion online at the store PC.When I went to put in my annual income, $17,000,000 was too large a number for the computer to accept.The store manager said that I could wait in the store, while he made a few calls.I offered to come back on Tuesday, when I could see if the store personal computer would accept an entry as large as $17,000,000.In regard to \"Die Another Day,\" the store manager refused to offer a free rental -- despite the fact that I gave 4 forms of positive identification, and let them know my true \"identity.\"One security concern:  The Hollywood Video application for one of their cards asks for your Social Security number.\"', '\"Wow. This was atrocious. Unbelievably bad. Embarrassing. There\\'s literally 20 minutes of action and an hour and 40 minutes of stupidity. The action scenes are the most ridiculous, over-the-top, comedic, absurd, preposterous action scenes ever filmed. I laughed out loud several times. EVERYTHING explodes when Cruise shoots it...EVERYTHING - don\\'t be surprised if you see wooden chairs exploding in this movie. Cruise does the most pointless stunts imaginable, like dragging his feet on the side of a motorcycle (COOL!!!!??) and doing nose wheelies across the street on his motorcycle (NEAT!!!!!) I was actually waiting for Cruise to do a dance after his K.O. on the sand, take off his glasses, crush them under his foot, then wink at the camera and do a thumbs up just in case. Cruise is also a master fighter, gunman, base jumper, biker, driver, and all-around perfect guy.Bad guys chase after Cruise, who is actually invincible in this movie, and die left and right in bloodless, painless deaths. It actually makes violence fun and cool! The bad guys outnumber Cruise and unload hundreds of bullets and can\\'t even come close to hitting him, yet Cruise can do barrel rolls off of motorcycles while shooting his gun and blowing up trucks with ease. I was hoping he would\\'ve been blindfolded - wouldn\\'t have been implausible. This might appeal to a 9-year-old. That seems to be the target audience. The 2-disc DVD has almost 10 minutes of bonus features! There\\'s a skit, some awards show excerpts, and a very short documentary. That\\'s it. Real pathetic cash-in. The only reason it was released is to add the M:I-3 teaser. Boo.\"', '\"I have not read the novel(I understand that this follows the/his style well, however), and all I know about the series is what I gathered from the three prior films. I suppose a good place to start is admitting that neither I, nor my fiancÃ©e whom I watched it with, particularly care for or understand the casting of Ben in action(not that there\\'s necessarily an awful lot of such in this) movies. We don\\'t see how he fits that(and his lack of screen presence and charisma shows). Beyond that, this is actually quite fine, if it should maybe not have been connected to the franchise(restarting it as it were, and do note that they are now, evidently, little more than half a decade after this, rebooting it yet again). Baldwin made a determined, if reluctant hero of Jack, Ford took that over well(obviously, since that sums up most of his career), and this time, Affleck... kind of turns him into a whiny pretty boy(although the writing of the role doesn\\'t deviate that strongly from that of the others... it lies in his performance). Not to mention that Dafoe\\'s Clark\\'d kick the ass of Schreiber\\'s, which is not to say that the latter does poorly. The characters, in general, aren\\'t bad. The casting is spot-on, save for the two aforementioned exceptions. The acting, as well. This has positive aspects to it, and even if you like the other entries, you could still enjoy this, as my wife-to-be suggested, merely think of those parts, Ryan and John, as not being the same, previously(and better) established ones. The story has well-done elements(possibly rehashed from earlier incarnations of the universe, but not all, and not the fundamental concept), and has realized potential(not the full extent of it, though). It is particularly sound until it all derails near the conclusion, succumbing to the agenda being pushed(no matter the implausibilities that occur along the way... and creative license is taken with the technology to move this along smoothly). The president\\'s advisors in this aren\\'t terribly well defined, in specific government jobs... they are basically just a cacophony of voices telling him what to or not to do. The pacing is reasonable, never losing the audience. Save for the distinctly corny and/or hokey lines(and TMI), the dialog is decent and serves its purpose. There is scattered language(on that, mostly Russian and the other foreign tongues are spoken when they would be so, yet it\\'s not difficult to follow) of varying degrees throughout, seldom too harsh. The tone is fairly light, arguably inappropriate(think of the subject matter... this almost goes entirely in the other direction, and underplays the severity of what takes place), and the youthfulness of this got to be downright silly, as did the excessive modernizing. The former can probably be attributed to the director, and while that worked for Sneakers(we do consider that to be a well-produced effort, mind you), it should perhaps not be found in a serious, political thriller with the intention of being smart. That might have also have affected the feeling of danger, presumably inadvertently, as the first half of this really didn\\'t have us on the edge of our seats. With few exceptions, the way this was shot and edited is rather nice. The gadgets and some of the situation resolutions seem out of place. A fight comes off as tacked on. This doesn\\'t go as far as certain things indicated it would. The Hollywood factor(not eternally present here) of this(above what the preceding pictures had), and the abrupt and oversimplified fix-all ending hurt the credibility and value of this. The special effects are marvelous, albeit a single sequence did inspire my better half to point out how much it looked like a video-game. The DVD contains several well-done and interesting enough featurettes, the theatrical trailer(it does reveal important plot, as does the description on the main page here, new viewers may want to avoid them until after, if they\\'re worried about spoilers) and a commentary track with Robinson and the cinematographer, and a second with Clancy(who picks it apart mercilessly, and adds his dry, biting wit and irony, as well as swearing, expertise and name-dropping) in addition to Phil(both are informational and worth the listen). I recommend this to any fan of Jack Ryan, the people who made this and/or Tom Clancy. Do bring a solid dose of salt, for all the stuff in this that is best taken with a grain of that. 7/10\"', '\"A very good movie which combines action and comedy well. I love the setup, and the fact that I was still surprised even when you knew how the ending would happen. Very enjoyable. The middle drags on a bit, but the beginning and ending surely doesn\\'t disappoint! 8/10\"', '\"When I saw that John Woo was directing MI2, I was afraid the movie would be more action than mystery.  What I loved about the first Mission Impossible was that it made me think.  But, MI2 successfully combines the great (sometimes a little over-dramatic) action scenes with a thinking man\\'s plot-line.  The music by Hans Zimmer adds a lot to the movie as well. Even at the opening credits I was almost bubbling over with excitement.  Who knew Cruise could be the next Karate Kid?\"', '\"If you have seen Point Break there is absolutely no need to see this movie. The plot is EXACTLY the same, just substitute the skydiving/surfing with street racing and you have it.Point Break: Undercover FBI agent, Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), infiltrates a group of surfers suspected of robbing banks. The group has a very charismatic leader, Bodhi (Patrick Swayze).Fast and the Furious: Undercover cop, Brian O\\'Conner (Paul Walker), infiltrates a group of street racers suspected of hijacking electronic equipment. The street racer group also has a very charismatic leader, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel).Point Break: The FBI agent finds himself increasingly attracted to the adrenaline-charged lifestyle of the community he has infiltrated and Bodhi\\'s ex girlfriend. This causes an internal struggle for Utah, as his fondness for the Bodhi and the lifestyle he embodies conflicts with his duty as an FBI agent.Fast and the Furious: The police officer also finds himself increasingly attracted to the adrenaline-charged lifestyle of the street racing community and also has a romantic interest in the form Toretto\\'s younger sister. The lifestyle of Toretto and cronies and said romantic interest again causes, just as in Point Break, a conflict with his duties as a police officer.Point Break: Utah first suspects another group of surfers as the \"Ex-Presidents\" bank robbers and organises a FBI raid on them. He subsequently finds out that they are not the guilty party.Fast and the Furious: O\\'Conner first suspects another group of racers and orders a raid on them. He subsequently finds out that they are not the guilty party.Point Break: Bodhi and his fellow surfers are the bank robbers, they go for the jackpot and it all goes horribly wrong. Utah, who befriended Bodhi, lets him get away.Fast and the Furious: Toretto and his crew are the hijackers, they also go for \"the jackpot\" and again it goes horribly wrong. O\\'Conner, who befriended Toretto, lets him get away.You would think that Hollywood actually takes into account that the average person\\'s memory is slightly superior to that of a goldfish.Except for that carbon copy plot I quite enjoyed it and can recommend it for anyone who hasn\\'t seen Point Break.\"', '\"As an avid fan of the series I am going to be unbiased here. This was a fantastic first movie of the franchise that really set the tone for the films that would follow. This is one of the only movies of the series that had a realistic plot and just remember the series and their fans are like Torreto said, \"We don\\'t have friends, we have family!\"\"', '\"Well, this was a pretty poor excuse for a movie. I liked the first and third but the second was awful. You would know John Woo was involved by the inclusion of doves flying through the under ground lair shortly after an explosion! I just don\\'t get the dove thing.It is a pretty straight forward, brain at the door action movie but the real problem with it is the huge inconsistencies throughout the movie. OK, the acting is a bit crappy, there\\'s the token love interest and everything else is pretty forgettable but its an action movie, thats their nature sometimes.The \\'chase\\' scenes are awful to be fair to them, especially the motorbike one. How is it that his bike doesn\\'t explode when his gas tank is hit but everything he shoots blows up? How can a bullet fired almost directly at you shatter the visor on the bike and not hit the passenger? Then to top it all off before duelling with there bikes on the sand, the high performance road bikes take an off camera pit-stop to change the slick tires to off-road. This brief rant illustrates the stream of flaws through the movie and I think Mr. Woo should be accountable. Tut tut John. If you want action try somewhere else because this will leave you under whelmed. Try number III, its not all bad.\"', '\"Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) are back in action in \"Bad Boys 2\"! This time they are chasing a Ecstasy trafficker called Johnny Tapia (Jordi Molla). Meanwhile, in all the kerfuffle, Mike is in love with Marcus\\' sister, Sydney (Gabrielle Union). I, most personally, LOVE this movie because it has GREAT action and GREAT stunts. One part in this movie that is my favourite is when Mike and Marcus are finding out clues about the Ecstasy case with Tapia in a camera store...and when the owner flips a camera switch, he and the whole store watch Mike and Marcus talk about Marcus\\' problems (along with a problem about Marcus\\' erection and other things). There\\'s also the MacArthur Highway chase sequence, where it ended with an explosion and a whole load of burning cars (awesome!) **** out of *****\"', '\"So Bond is going against his boss again. Strange how Timothy Dalton gets slated for doing that in Licence to Kill but Die Another Day gets praise for a return to form for Brosnan. Brosnan is ageing fast like roger moore\\'s later bond\\'s and it might be time to hand over the role pierce. die another day is reasonable, despite halle berry\\'s failed attempt to once again show bond has \\'met his match\\' in a woman.  madonna\\'s embarrasing cameo and the villains who are about as dangerous as graham norton and look like chakie chan and ron howard. the cars are nice and the effects good, brosnan is ok, but is only doing what connery, moore and dalton did before him. The sex scenes are getting more intense, in a bid to juice up the failing scripts and judi dench is also playing it too serious and still thinks she has to show being a woman boss is revolutionary.i hear connery is directing the next one. they should give timothy dalton his 3rd go as bond to finally give him the real blockbuster he deserves to give him really widespread appeal.\"', '\"Like the first Bad Boys film, the sequel feels like something straight out of the 80\\'s - thin plot, cheesy bad guys and hundreds of henchmen who get riddled by bullets by the heroes.Surely films like Speed and The Matrix put these bang-bang action movies where they belonged and we\\'ve moved on.  Not so with Bad Boys 2, which could easily have been made in 1985.On the other hand there are some great action scenes and the freeway chase is ALMOST as much fun as the one in The Matrix Reloaded.  It\\'s incredibly sick instead of being blackly funny like Grosse Pointe Blank.  Corpses burst and people get there heads blown off every ten minutes.If it wasn\\'t so damn long I would say go and watch it for a guilty pleasure. It\\'s fun, but stupid and crass, and is actually a step backwards for Bay.\"', '\"The first film was not a classic, but it had energy and well staged action. This sequel is a weak comparison and Michael Bay hits this with absolutely everything. The plotting is all over the place and the it\\'s just a incoherent mess. Action scenes overtake everything and the humour is either forced or poorly staged. Michael Bay delivers incredible hardcore action and it\\'s fun to watch, but over the course of the film it grows tiresome and numbing. I\\'m happy the third film has had a change of filmmaker and appears to be a solid sequel. This film takes what was awesome from the first film and removes it. Where is the theme music? The composer was removed for a more formulaic one.\"', '\"In the tradition of most Bond films, this movie has plenty of what we\\'re expecting from a Bond film. The storyline is a bit out there in terms of technology, even more so than most Bondians are used to (That is if you forget about Moonraker). While the beginning of the movie was gritty and realistic during the torture scene, I found the rest of the movie to be far-fetched. That\\'s not to say it isn\\'t good. But they could\\'ve toned it down a bit. I think they fooled most of the viewers and made it convincing by saying words like \"polymer\", \"DNA reconstruction technology\" and \"television\". Oh and Halle Berry is about as entertaining to watch as shredding paper.\"', '\"This movie is a combination of James Bond, The Matrix, and a Kung Fu movie. I\\'d add Star Wars, but even a Jedi isn\\'t as coordinated as Tom Cruise is made out to be (and they don\\'t grin as much).Ving Rhames is excellent in this movie - you wish he had more of a role, perhaps making use of the incredible intensity he showed when he appeared in an episode of Tour of Duty. He\\'s a star in the making.\"', '\"This film is probably the dumbest sh** I have ever tried to watch. They have made about ten of these films now and I\\'m sure they gotten worse since this one. Anyone with half a Brain should avoid this.\"', '\"\"Shaft\" is a weakly done action thriller. Samuel L. Jackson\\'s portrayal of the Shaft-character never reaches that level of coolness his character had in Pulp Fiction. The story is somewhat tedious and never really captures the audience. The \"Peoples Hernandez\"-character, played by Jeffrey Wright, never manages to become the menacing bad guy it was intended to be, throughout the movie it appears comical partly due to Jeffrey Wright\\'s physical appearance, which is very non-threatening. I also noted that several times during the shoot outs in the film the characters were discharing their weapons despite the slide being locked back, indicating that the weapons are our of ammunition. On a big Hollywood production like this, something like that should be corrected. All in all I would not bother with this film if I were you.\"', '\"What total s**te I was forced to watch!!! After my 13 y.o recommended this movie to me I decided to hire the dvd. The plot was pathetic, the cop who has been on the tial of this hijack gang ends up letting the ringleader take his car and run!!...WTF????I wish I\\'d read reviews about this movie B$ I paid out good money to see probably the trashiest piece of cinema ever...See at your own risk.\"', '\"Beautifully directed send-up, with Jumpin\\' Jackie Chan at his absolute funniest. For purists, there are stunts aplenty, but it\\'s the give-and-take between Chan and co-star Owen Wilson that makes this one Chan\\'s finest. I was one of those early converts who waited DECADES to see Jackie Chan make an \"American comedy.\" While RUSH HOUR had its moments, it also had Chris Tucker (and, if you can stomach his Michael Jackson schtick, you\\'re a better man than I am- or will ever be). This time around, he\\'s teamed with someone who\\'s capable of giving as good as he gets. Good writing helps. Chan is the modern Chaplin (pun intended; Chaplin fans, please take note). If you\\'re one of those fence-sitters who hasn\\'t yet taken the plunge, this is the best jumping-off point. Check out Jackie Chan. You can thank me later.\"', '\"Stating that this movie had a story would be next to a lie. Its more a nice mix of word jokes, situation jokes, and arranged stunts.And it is a fanshow, for fans of Drew Barrymore (like me) and Cameron Diaz. Fans of Drew Barrymore get some very funny scenes with her and the most hated person in the world: her boyfriend Tom Green. And they get some scenes where she\\'s, well, not that completely dressed. Fans of Cameron Diaz get of course some of her smiles, and some extremely funny scenes, such as one with a postman. Well there are many other scenes in the same style.Fortunately I\\'ve no clue about the original TV show, so comparison with it is impossible for me. If it was anything like this movie, I doubt I\\'m interested in it, anyway.If you like the main actors, you\\'ll like the movie; if you don\\'t like them, I think you\\'re wasting your time with this. Or maybe if you want a \"girls feel good movie\". Ah, and you have to have some taste for really crazy jokes. But all fans of Drew and Cameron have to have that anyway.\"', '\"Greetings from Lithuania.Writing. Writing was the first and the most important reason why \"Men in Black\" II (2002) is actually one of the worst sequels that has ever been made. I loved the first movie, which was truly funny and original piece of entertainment. But this one lacked anything that made first film so good and in a first place - a good writing. While the story here is pretty pathetic, i believe that every story no matter how crazy they are can be made into a good movie, but there has to be a good writing in a first place. \"Men in Black\" II did not have it and it failed miserably.Overall, \"Men in Black\" II is not only a low point of the series, its one of the worst sequels ever made. Its overproduced, overwritten and lacked everything that made first movie great.\"', '\"I can\\'t beging to describe what i felt for this movie...the beginging was good up until bond has a stand off with the generals son and then it\\'s all downhill from there. Techno, a lack of bond charisma, too many puns, bad fx(oh how they were so horrible), and way too corny is what comes up. This was more like austin powers, meets power rangers than a bond movie. matrix effects, and hardly any bond music. ANy bad guy that wears a metal suit that electrocutes people should get lost. 4/10\"', '\"I actually do like a lot of rebooted/remakes, such as Dawn of the Dead, Halloween or Star Trek. But, of course, for every three that are good, a dozen or more are mediocre at best. That\\'s not the case here.Granted, I have not seen, nor really desire to see the original Ocean\\'s Eleven, after what I read and researched about it. I\\'ll just take this movie at face value.More than just a remake, this movie ranks HIGH on my all-time favorites list. I have probably seen it twice the number in the title and plan on more visits to one of the most creative, funny and just plain entertaining movies I have ever seen. It helps that I am a George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon fan and I can enjoy Brad Pitt and Andy Garcia from time to time. But, put all of those, plus a lot more, together and you have probably the highest level of chemistry between any casts in any movie.Ocean (Clooney) is released on probation from jail and first things first: he starts high-rolling his latest heist scheme by rounding up the usual suspects through his buddy, Rusty (Pitt.) Their diabolical plan is to rob three Las Vegas casinos in a single night, all from the same vault under the Bellagio. To do so, they need (almost) a dozen men and everything to go as planned.That\\'s the basic premise, but there is so much more richness to this movie that causes oodles of repeat watching.Number one: Even though the chemistry is pitch perfect across the board, even involving enemies, its Clooney and Pitt that make this jump three levels. Their banter and understanding of each other while finishing each other\\'s thoughts and sentences hasn\\'t been seen since the 1950s. Usually that involved Cary Grant and a various female lead. Here, sexuality aside, these two cats had it down. They added humor, pose and you rooted for them every step of the way, even though, in reality, they\\'re the bad guys.Number Two: The remaining cast was excellent. Each held their own, each had their own depth. Not two alike. Damon was great as the nervous and up\\'n\\'coming\\'thieving Linus, brothers Virgil and Turk were played hilariously by Caan and Affleck and Jemison played the computer nerd wonderfully. Those are just four. Mark my words: EVERY SINGLE actor in this film was perfect in their respective roles. I could go on another 1,000 words on each one and not do them the justice they did for themselves.Number Three: It\\'s pure fantasy. I consider myself somewhat a Vegas Expert â€“ I\\'ve been following, studying and visiting Sin City since I was about 13-15. THIS COULD NEVER HAPPEN. Even if one aspect of their master robbery plan would partially work, it would be thwarted in seconds. And that\\'s part of the fun. You know this is unrealistic, yet, we\\'re so drawn into it, it\\'s extremely enjoyable. That\\'s due to (#4 below) the dialogue and character depth that acts as a (no coincidence) diversion to the improbability of what\\'s happening on screen.Number Four: The dialogue was original, deep, snappy and quotable from line one. Speaking of which, those first two words spoken, by both the probation officer and repeated by Daniel Ocean, \"Good Morning\" seriously became my tagline, no matter the time of day. I would walk into Santisi Brothers, my local pub and watering hole for going on ten years and tell my favorite waitresses \"Good Morning.\" I did it so much, that I didn\\'t catch myself sometimes and some newbie\\'s would tell me it was evening. I always replied, \"It\\'s morning somewhere.\"I mention that story because this movie had such an impact on me, it became part of my subconscious. Oh, and there\\'s plenty more lines I absolutely love: \"Whiskey. And whiskey.\" \"I only lied about being a thief and I don\\'t do that anymore. â€“ Steal? â€“ Lie.\" \"All reds!\" There\\'s more than a hundred more. Admittedly, some still go over my head including ones about the caper lifestyle I\\'m not familiar with. Though I can\\'t necessarily follow what an \"Ella Fitzgerald\" is, it just proves how brilliant this movie is. (And no, I refuse to Google it. I love my ignorance and the movie\\'s intelligence.) It\\'s nice to revisit a movie and either hear/catch things I haven\\'t before or enjoy the dialogue I did.Number Five: I get cranky when it comes to Vegas-Themed movies. They rarely get it right â€“ Con Air and 21 being the most offensive and misappropriated views of the city. This movie got it right. And it was gorgeous. Though now a (only a tad) bit dated â€“ it\\'s 9 years old, after all, it still captures the essence of the beautiful strip, inside the casino and out. It doesn\\'t just take the finale in front of the Bellagio water fountains to tell you: they knew Vegas.Number Six: Simply intelligence. This script was perfect. Rarely will I encounter such a well written, well rounded script from minute one to the end where they introduce Julia Roberts. Everything worked here, from dialogue, to interactions, to tension, to comedy. In a word: masterpiece in writing.If you have yet to experience Ocean\\'s Eleven, you are missing out on a modern classic. Whether or not you like George Clooney or Bad Guys as heroes, you will love this. This worked in 2001 and will be timeless enough to be shown in 2050 and have the same impact. SEE IT!\"', '\"\"Shanghi Noon\" seems kind of a extension of \"Rush Hour\".  A two different racial men fight each other, be friends, and blah blah... I liked some of the cinematography, such as intersection  of the duel scens. Plot also was a decent except for the last part.  Why Jackie Chan\\'s indian wife falls for the white guy? I thought she was suppose to be loyal to her husband. And the princess falls for her servant?! She even seems naked when she held Chan\\'s hand. It seems to fit into the formular of the block buster but I felt very uncomfortble.\"', '\"I\\'m going on the assumption here that you saw the first MIB (if you didn\\'t, stop reading this now and rent it - it\\'s a fairly good movie). Remember when Agent K was looking in on his wife, with that wistful smile, then stopped when Agent J caught him and came up with the ham-handed \"Well, you know, it\\'s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.\" Remember the reply? \"Try it.\" I know what he felt. That\\'s why I was happy (along with many fans of the movie) to see the picture of a smiling Agent K reunited with his wife at the end of the first movie.Well, when they wrote this movie, they must have forgotten about all that, because this movie has about as much emotion as a Kleenex tissue paper. They try reversing the roles this time around, giving Agent J someone to be in love with, but it doesn\\'t work. It\\'s forced on us (after all, if he zaps her like he\\'s supposed to, goodbye movie), and thus I didn\\'t care what happened.Don\\'t get me wrong - this movie still has some funny stuff, including a funny role for Johnny Knoxville (okay, yes, I\\'m a fan, big deal!), but I\\'m just glad I was able to get the matinee showing so I wouldn\\'t have to waste any more money seeing this movie than I had to. And at 81 minutes long (not including the end credits), you better not bother going to the bathroom during the middle of the movie - you might wind up missing half the movie.\"', '\"This was a real good flick.  Never boring with lots of action and some interesting twists.  I never really knew where this film was going and who might betray who.  Also the acting was very good even to the smallest part. James Dean Lives and even the nervous mechanic was much like Sal Mineo in Rebel Without a Cause.  Great movie.\"', '\"I wasn\\'t going into this movie expecting much, and maybe that\\'s why I enjoyed it so much.  It wasn\\'t a bad film at all, and it wasn\\'t profound either.. it was just simply enjoyable.  While I\\'m a huge fan of movies that make you think, mindf*** movies, such as Memento, Donnie Darko, & Fight Club... I also enjoy the mindless, Hollywood\"esque\", all star, big budget films.  There really isn\\'t much to say other than, sit back and have a good time.  It\\'s a fun movie 9/10\"', '\"This was the first film in what would become a non-stop high octane franchise full of cool and fast cars racing and chasing each other, including lots of action and some stunts along the way, directed by Rob Cohen (Dragonheart). Basically a string of high-speed truck robberies, stealing millions of dollars worth of electronic equipment, have been occurring, Los Angeles street racing gang leader Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is under suspicion for these hijacking crimes. Brian O\\'Conner (Paul Walker) is an officer for the LAPD and goes undercover, joining Toretto\\'s highly skilled crew of racers, taking part in many illegal late night street races for high stakes. As time goes by however Brian is compromising his assignment by becoming part of Toretto\\'s life, he is sympathising with the chief suspect, and falling in love with Toretto\\'s sister Mia (The Faculty\\'s Jordana Brewster), he eventually starts to try and prove Toretto\\'s innocence. Also starring Michelle Rodriguez as Toretto\\'s girlfriend Letty, Die Another Day\\'s Rick Yune as Johnny Tran, Chad Lindberg as Jesse, Johnny Strong as Leon, Ted Levine as Sergeant Tanner, Matt Schulze as Vince, rapper Ja Rule as Edwin, Space Jam\\'s Thom Barry as Agent Bilkins and Bruce Almighty\\'s Noel Gugliemi as Hector. Diesel with his gravely voice is cool, Walker is blank most of the time but a reasonable hero, and supporting cast members Brewster and Rodriguez do fine as well. To be honest, the storyline going on is not the thing to pay the fullest attention to, as the title suggests it the pedal-to-the-metal stuff, all the colourful and cool cars fuelled up, with extra rocket boosters and switches, that speed and crash their way around, and the explosions and stunts along the way keep the pace up as well, all in all it is a worthwhile action thriller. Good!\"', '\"No, not as long as we have to consider \"Man With the Golden Gun\"or \"Diamonds Are Forever\" but \"Die Another Day\" is, nonetheless,a stinker. Pierce Brosnan is still the best Bond since Connery. Theopening sequence is still the best part of the movie. Q and M arestill played by fine British actors. But the writing! I can\\'t remember when I\\'ve been so embarrassed for the hiredhelp who have to emit the kind of self-parodying rubbish thatpasses for snappy one-liners in this film. The patter between Bondand Jinx (when was a heroine\\'s name so apt as for the dreadfulMs Berry?) was supposed to reveal some kind of sexual tensionbetween the two but it had the audience in fits of giggles when Isaw it. The dialogue in the all-girl sword fight is even worse.I\\'m glad this wasn\\'t Brosnan\\'s last Bond film because he deservesto bow out in something far better than this.\"', '\"Before I begin to complain, let me say that I gave this film a 7 out of 10; I don\\'t dislike it.That said, there is a certain amount of sadness to this entire scenario. The action scenes have slowed, the stunts become less spectacular, and in some cases, clearly not performed by Jackie Chan.  Now I don\\'t blame him for this...at the ripe old age of 42, Jackie has destroyed himself for our entertainment time after time.  So much so, in fact, that his poor, tortured, patched and re-patched body just can\\'t handle the kind of abuse he used to heap on himself.  It shows.In addition to the obvious slowdown of the action, it once again becomes painfully clear that very few american directors know how to clearly portray a complex fight scene.  Even with Jackie not at the top of his game, this is incredibly complicated choreography compared to most american fare.  Where a Hong Kong director would pull the camera back and give us long takes, making certain that the moves and positions of the combatants are clear to the audience, american directors insist on bringing the camera in close and cutting often.  This blurs the clarity of the action and creates a lot of confusion as to who\\'s where, and who\\'s fist is colliding with whose face.Complaining aside, action is only half the draw of a Jackie Chan film. Comedy has always been a strong element in his ouvre, and \"Shanghai Noon\" doesn\\'t let us down there.  Any longtime Jackie fan knows of his incredible gift for physical comedy, and his goofing is as good as ever here.  The real surprises lie in some very well-written comic dialogue, and that dialogue\\'s delivery by Owen Wilson.  Given that Wilson is a gifted comic writer himself (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore), one has to wonder if he re-composed some of his dialogue himself.  Some of the eastern-cliche meets western-cliche exchanges between the two are inspired.Lucy Liu, on the other hand, I found disappointing.  It may seem a strange thing to say about a chinese actress, but I found her unconvincing as a Chinese.  Her performance seemed like a shallow american interpretation of what a chinese woman would be like.  As a longtime fan of Hong Kong action cinema, I just find myself wondering what Anita Mui or Maggie Cheung could have done in the role.All in all, this is on a par with \"Rush Hour\"; a solid american take on the Hong Kong institution that is the Jackie Chan movie.  It\\'s just no \"Drunken Master II\", that\\'s all.\"', '\"First of all, I am very surprised about all the bad reviews that I have read on this movie.  Thank God there are some good reviews, about 1/2.I would like to comment on how stylish and breathtaking this movie is.  I have never seen Tom Cruise on the \"big screen\" until I saw MI-2 back in the end of July.  I was totally blown away with this movie.  After I saw this movie, I went out and rented all of his other movies.  Many of them were Oscar worthy material and he is one of the best actors to hit the theaters in a long time.I especially give him credit for his collaboration with John Woo on this movie.  It looks like they put a lot of time and effort into making this a blockbuster!  I believe that it has surpassed expectations and has become one of the hottest movies of the Summer.Now to my review of this movie.  I thought that Tom Cruise was outstanding as Ethan Hunt.  He expanded his character to be more sexy, romantic, sensitive, caring and cool and he knew how to get the job done. We just didn\\'t see this side of his character in MI-1, except being intelligent and getting the job done.  But don\\'t get me wrong, MI-1 was a great movie.  I also was one of the people who actually understood the plot!  I have always regretted that I have not seen MI-1 in the theater, I saw it on video. But you can\\'t compare the two movies.  They were completely different.  I think that I read an article where Tom stated that he wanted every MI movie to be different.  MI-2 is more of an action-thrill ride than the first movie and that was all it was supposed to be!!!Tom did a great job in acting this role.  It seems to have been a lot of fun for him along with his hard work as Producer as well.  His producing and John Woos directing spell SUCCESS! I also give him credit for doing the majority of his own stunts.  How many actors today would take the risk?I also thought that the other actors, Vring Rjames, Dougray Scott, Anthony Hopkins, were also very good, as well as Thandie Newton, in their respective roles.  I thought that they complimented Tom Cruise very well!!Contrary to many of the other reviews on the plot, I thought that the plot was interesting (not stupid), fun to watch, an exhilarating action thriller and pure entertainment.I thought (contrary to some reviews), that the chemistry between Ethan Hunt and Nyah Nordoff Hall was mesmerizing, cute, romantic, sexy and great to watch.  Tom has never looked better.  He is absolutely gorgeous! and she is very beautiful.  I feel a little jealous of her!!! I would like to comment also on Tom\\'s non-speaking acting.  His expressions on his face are priceless.  Without saying a word, you know exactly what he is feeling. He definitely did not want Nyah anywhere near Shawn Ambrose, but he also knew that he had a job to do. Having Nyah as a Trojan horse in the clutches of his nemesis was the only way to get the information he needed to save the world from catastrophy!I certainly did not think that this movie was a \"Tom Cruise Ego Trip\".  He was playing a super-spy and just acted accordingly.  To the people who trashed his performance, I have this to say, Lighten Up!  You must be extremely jealous of him or you do not know how to sit back, relax and enjoy a fun and exciting Summer movie.  It wasn\\'t supposed to make you think. It was supposed to entertain you!!!!  I think that you people need a life!In conclusion, let me add that I have since seen this movie several times and I think that it gets better each time I see it!  I previously did not know John Woos work as an action director, with the exception of Face Off, which I loved.  I think that He did a brilliant job in directing this movie. I think that he wanted people to see all the (cliches) of his other movies in this movie.  Apparently, that is his style and he does it well. Also, the cinematography was spectacular!If you still haven\\'t seen this movie, than I won\\'t spoil it for you.  See it.  You won\\'t regret it!Congratulations Tom and John on a job well done!  I will be anxiously awaiting MI-3.I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars!!!!!!!!!!!\"', '\"In a year of samey samey action movies, TFATF roared onto the scene as a fresh new twist. The plot has been done (Point Break), and the acting is so so, but the true stars of the movie is the cars and the culture that revolves around them. This movie will get your blood racing. Just be careful driving home afterwards :)\"', '\"A necessary evil of  action/spy thrillers such as Mission Impossible and all the James Bond films, is that the plots tend to be too complicated for everyone to easily follow. This film manages to avoid that pitfall, offering a plot that can actually be summed up in one sentence. In the spirit of not giving the plot away, I will forego writing that simple sentence. Just be assured anyone can follow the plot without too much trouble. The stunts are spectacular, and it appears as if Tom Cruise does a good deal of his own stunts, enhanced no doubt with a large amount of computer enhancements. Thus, my only criticism: A stunt has to look as if it is possible to actually pull off in real life. Most of these did not. You truly must suspend reality, and accept the superhuman feats which Ethan Hawke manages to pull off.And oh yes, Mission Impossible still has the greatest theme song ever put forth in a film.\"', '\"Since first watching Shanghai Noon, I have rented it at least 3 times. Now I have bought it, and watched it at least twice more.  Even knowing what is going to happen - and when, I get hysterical watching it.  Great scenery, great actors, enough drama, action, and romance to make it interesting. Hilarious lines, and Owen and Jackie seem to be made for the parts. Thanks for a great entertaining movie without the \"trash\" vocabulary that so many have these days. I LOVE THE MOVIE!!!!  Can\\'t wait to see \"Shanghai Knights\".\"', '\"This is a very fun movie that could have been excellent without Julia Roberts dragging it down. Now, normally I am a fan of Ms. Roberts, but here she is miscast and her part is poorly written. Unfortunately, said poorly written part is meant to be the linchpin that holds the entire motivation and structure together. Her character is treated as a stunning beauty, but we all know that Roberts\\'s appeal is not beauty but prettiness -- she is a nice girl, not a knockout, and that\\'s why her beauty -- when it does shine forth -- is so startling. Roberts looks like a pretty girl who, when she smiles at you, shocks you with her sudden radiance. But her character is the kind of woman who Makes an Entrance, and it just doesn\\'t work. Without either the looks or the dialogue, she creates a mushy center to a movie that needs to be sharp straight through.Still, the rest of the movie is diamond-edge sharp, the heist is entertaining, and the cast mainly sparkles. 8/10\"', '\"The movie was great, and I\\'ll have to agree with the critics in saying the first half of the movie was better than the second (Despite the car chase, my favorite part.) The only things I didn\\'t like were the fact that he was held in North Korea for so long. They should have made him stay there for six months tops. Instead they chose 14. Also I thought the 100,000 volt security system thing on Gustav Graves\\' suit was stupid. Other than those two things the movie lived up to my expectations for a Bond movie. It gets a strong 4 stars!!!\"', '\"For pure adrenalin and action, BB2 gets high marks. Throw in some pretty funny lines and funny scenes, it gets more high marks. Bad Boys 2 was very comparable to the first one. BB2 did go a little over the top with the drama and the feats that Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowery (Will Smith) performed; but the amazing feats were overshadowed by the comedy so as to take your mind off of: \"No way is that happening.\" I think it was classic how, even in the most dire situations, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were able to provide laughs. I think that is a lot better than them taking themselves too seriously, because then we\\'d have to call into question just about every stunt. The ending was a bit of a fizzle. After being somewhat light-hearted and humorous, the movie started to take a serious turn with a supposed portentous and riveting moment. Then there was the whole going into Cuba with a full tactical team thing. Still, BB2 had great car chase scenes, almost \"Heat\" like shootouts, and plenty of laughs.\"', '\"Okay, here we are at the 20 something Bond film in 40 years, and you know what?  He\\'s showing every one of those years.  It has now come to special effects, cool cars, crazy gizmos and chicks that Bond has become synonomis with.  With this installment of Bond, it draws uncomfortably close to the spin off Austin Power and Our Man Flint films.  I mean, they go as far as to put a giant \"Lazer\" into space which has been dubbed \"Icarus\" which will harness the suns power to shoot a superheated beam at the surface of the earth, unless, the earth pays us, a heft ransom.  hmmmmm, let\\'s see, didn\\'t Dr. Evil already teach us that space lazers don\\'t work??  If not, then how about Blofeld in Diamonds are Forever, or Alec Trevelyan in GoldenEye?? AHHHH, havn\\'t we have enough space lazers yet?? Diamond-faced Zao isn\\'t scoring any point with me either.  These villians seem to grow in  idiocy along with their inventions. I long for the good old days when Bond was about being a spy, not a one-man army.  We\\'ve reached the point where I no longer eagerly await the next Bond film, for I know there is no way that it will in this day in age live up to the Sean Connery Bond.  Not a prayer. As the plots grow more far out and idiotic, the explosions get bigger, his dodads become more unbelievable, and the overall depth of the character and plot grow thin. Sad.  Don\\'t go out of your way to see this one.\"', '\"I\\'ve read a lot of reviews saying they hated FnF because it had a shallow plot, only fair acting, and (gasp) even to many cars in it. People, this is not American Beauty or Magnolia. It\\'s a car movie. Thus, when preparing to see such a movie, dismiss plot, character depth, and storyline as a non-issue. Then, if it turns out to have those things, you can be fairly amazed. If it does not, that is fine too, for you got to see a bunch of beautiful cars going at high speeds on city streets, which was well and often pulled off in the movie. If you can\\'t deal with movies that aren\\'t oscar contenders, don\\'t see movies like this. jeez.\"', '\"The movie started a little slow, but turned out good, I didn\\'t like that Jack Ryan started over again.  He already prove himself getting a Russian Sub, killing drug dealers and attempted assassins, so why is he starting over??\"', '\"Since I did not bother to go watch MIB II in the theater, and just got the DVD out of the library, I watched my tape of the first movie as a refresher beforehand. This was probably a mistake, as it underlined what a severe decline the sequel was. With the exception of a few funny moments (the worm scene in the beginning was pretty good), most of the jokes seemed forced, as if someone attempted to recycle the humor in the first movie, without success. Let\\'s hope that there is not a 3rd movie in the works (I can see it now, straight to video starring Damon Wayans and Tom Arnold *shudder*).\"', '\"My Rating: *** out of ****. Its safe to say the Fast and the Furious is not an intelligent movie. However, that does not mean it is not entertaining. This is definitely escapist entertainment, or a popcorn movie like many people like to call them. Vin Diesel is impressive, he has a presence when on screen and he doesnt screw up when delivering his lines. This performance elevated him into stardom and I can definitely see why. Paul Walker is only adequate though, he pales when hes next to Diesel. Jordana Brewster makes Mia into a very appealing character. Michelle Rodriguez is once again playing a tough girl. Rick Yune is effective as the bad guy. Fast and the Furious does have a few bad lines but that is expected in some summer movies. Mostly the dialogue is fine. The car races and chases are well shot. The film has a few scenes that are a bit overlong but the movie will mostly hold your attention.\"', '\"Who\\'s watching this in 2018? Well, I did, out of curiosity, after hearing about the new movie coming out. Boy, John Woo\\'s over the top directing didn\\'t age well, the action scenes are sometimes so ridiculous and outright dumb that you feel you\\'re watching a B movie. I often burst out laughing during the fight scenes. Story-wise they do everything to make a simple plot look extremely convoluted, but it doesn\\'t become any more intriguing. Don\\'t even get me started on the female lead that doesn\\'t really do anything, but apparently John Woo loved her looks so much that half of the movie is just scenes where they point the camera at her doing nothing. It\\'s so bad, you have to see it.\"', '\"This movie tries to better the competition on every front. In doing so it spreads too thin and falls up short.Note to director and writer\\'s for future reference.1. To really pull off truly incredible stunts a movie needs to have the fantasy elements of a film like \\'The Matrix\\' in order to suspend the disbelief of the viewer.2. The hero of the plot needs to possess the roguish charm of a character like Pierce Brosnan\\'s James Bond to attract the ladies at the drop of a hat. Women are attracted to good-looking bad boy heroes.Throughout this movie Cruise holds onto his good guy in Hollywood persona. John Woo should have talked his star in to taking some real risks with the character, other than the treacherous mountain shots, which, although real, we are informed, looked positively corny. (The audience was having a real good belly laugh, anyway).The plot was very thin, so thin that it looked merely like a vehicle on which to hang all the super action shots. Thus creating a tremendous sense of imbalance throughout the entire movie.Best bits - Even though they raise a few giggles - the Action scenes are very good, amazingly choreographed. John Woo fans will not be disappointed. The cinematography was excellent. The Spanish flamenco scene was one of the best in terms of beauty and visual tension.Ving Rhames and John Polson as the trusty sidekicks were great, and gave the film some much needed character. Thandie Newman was perfect and played her part well.Now, just before I go point number 3. For all US film companies, writers and directors. Go easy on creating ALL Australian characters as a potential Crocodile Dundee stereotype, unless you want the whole audience to class you as a bunch of dumb yanks.\"', '\"This was an actual \\'movie\\'. The sequels were just entertainment takes. People forgot about the actual contents of this movie.The main part of the movie is the trust-and-suspect-relationship between (undercover agent-) Brian and Dominic with his team. This is a red line in the movie and made you want to keep watching.Somewhere along the way, you lose awareness of Brian\\'s mission and start respecting Dominic\\'s team. You want Brian to get into the group and be with the beautiful cute girl. It is about \\'the family\\'.It was also about Dom being a unique character who tells you about his past, his father\\'s race, the 10-second-race story and all. It was exactly how a movie about cars, races and action should be. Simple but powerful and beautiful.This was all build up really well. In a cool traditional (unforced) way, we were introduced with cool cars, cool people, street-racing and stuff.Before the end, a series of events happened that made you very excited. These events that happened are somehow connected and brought a sort of realistic thrilling experience. Here, the acting skills were superb and the drama in the scenes were pictured in a pitch-perfect traditional way. Brian was a lot tougher here than in the sequels where he was like Dom\\'s slave or something.It\\'s beautiful to see Brian and Dom at the end: Brian betrayed him and should arrest him but instead, they do the 10 second-race and don\\'t know what to think about each other. This race was one of the most memorable scenes in film-history. After Dom hits the truck and survives the air-spinning of his car, Brian gave him the keys of his car, his car that has just also finished the 10-second-race. So, he finally gave Dom a 10-second-car and by doing that, he officially shows that he is not going to arrest him anymore.Somehow, he knew that Dom should not be sent to jail all along, even though he appeared to be a trucker-thief after-all......\"', '\"\\'Ocean\\'s Eleven\\', a film that was originally made in 1960 with: Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack; and without: success, took someone of a calibre and grit that only Steven Soderbergh possesses; to be remade. But this time around, the film turns out to be an interesting ride, thanks mainly to an amazingly cool and hip cast and an improved script. Using James Bond-like gadgetry and an unreal approach to the proceedings, the film makes for interesting and arrested viewing.The story of \\'Ocean\\'s Eleven\\' revolves around Danny Ocean(George Clooney), a thief just out of prison and ready for his next heist: robbing three Las Vegas casinos in one night. As much impossible as this sounds, it is but obvious that he needs to assemble probably the world\\'s best men on this project. Here begins the search for the best of the best. It is this phase of the movie and the subsequent preparation for the big night that is probably the most entertaining. This assimilation of various people, excellent at what they do, includes Rusty(Brad Pitt), Linus Caldwell(Matt Damon), Basher Tarr(Don Cheadle), Tishkoff(Elliot Gould), Frankie(Bernie Mac), the Malloy brothers(Scott Caan, Casey Affleck), a Chinese acrobat(Shaobo Qin), a computer wizard(Edward Jemison), and an old-timer Bloom(Carl Reiner). As each one of them prepares for their respective roles in this \"biggest heist ever\", Rusty begins to suspect Ocean\\'s real motives: acquisition of the money or the retrieval of his lost love Tess(Julia Roberts), now with the owner of these three casinos; Terry Benedict(Andy Garcia). How the story moves from here till the ultimate robbery is brilliantly held together by a tight script and an awesome climax with a twist, if you may call it so!The high point of this movie, apart from the studded star cast, is the performance put in by each actor. Everyone performs their role with effortless ease. Also, none of the cast appears to be affected by the presence of the other. This works wonderfully for the movie, as not only does the cast have a lot of fun but every single member of the audience feels comfortable. The other thing that works in this movie\\'s favour is that it doesn\\'t stick only to the heist but dwelves into other seemingly less-important but highly effective areas like the moments of interaction between Clooney and Roberts, with the latter trying to resist the charms of the former. The dialogues are void of profanity, which makes these characters innocent and hence, likable. Almost midway through the movie, you begin to view the \"11\" not as crooks but as your friends trying to make through an examination that you very much feel a part of yourself. At times, one does wonder at the ease at which these guys go through their work. But, then considering that most of the film proceeds like a fantasy, you might as well let it be a fable.Steven Soderbergh clearly showcases his variety of talent by making a movie as commercial and racy as this, especially after movies like \\'Erin Brockovich\\' and \\'Traffic\\'. This is one person who has every right to swagger. He does let his trademark penchant for quirky visuals creep in, in those frequent flashes and the scene with the entire \\'Eleven\" at the end. Mr. Soderbergh, take a bow!From the cast, it is Pitt who excels as he suavely walks through his portrayal of Rusty. George Clooney does his part with all earnest. This is one man who can make audiences(read \"women\") swoon just by giving a tilt to his head. Julia Roberts and Matt Damon are wasted in roles that were underwritten, but this doesn\\'t stop them from bringing themselves to the notice of everyone. Andy Garcia does good enough to be liked in the role of the only unlikeable character in the movie. The others perform their roles honestly, but the surprise package comes from Carl Reiner as the old and worn-out Bloom. His screen-presence makes you feel as warm as the cookies prepared by your Grandma. Just for this cast, that will almost definitely never be reassembled, this movie\\'s worth a watch.Rating- **** Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent\"', '\"Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan continues his leap into American movies by taking on the most American genre of all -- the Western -- in Shanghai Noon, a film that mixes elements of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", \"Blazing Saddles\" and Chan\\'s own \"Rush Hour\" with various levels of success.Owen Wilson easily steals the movie right out from under Chan.  The quirky Wilson makes a better American partner for Chan than Rush Hour\\'s Chris Tucker.  Like Chan, Wilson\\'s likability as a hero stems from his lack of cockiness -- both express a goofy amazement in their own achievements that\\'s endearing.Chan\\'s usual Buster Keaton-meets-Fred Astaire-meets-Bruce Lee fighting style is on display as always, albeit with fewer acrobatics than normal.  Missing is Chan\\'s one big stunt -- there\\'s no hanging from a helicopter, no walking down the side of a sky-scraper -- even the closing credits montage of outtakes doesn\\'t feature the usual quota of bone-shattering mishaps involving the actor/stuntman.  One can\\'t help but think that at 46, Chan may be slowing down a bit.With the action toned down, the humor is stepped-up to compensate.  Besides the aforementioned Wilson, yuks are generated by a tribe of Native Americans straight out of a Mel Brooks comedy -- the same goes for Chan\\'s drunken horse.  Xander Berkeley is also thrown in as a psychotic Marshal with Snidely Whiplash facial hair, looking like something out of a silent movie (I spent much of the film waiting for him to tie a damsel to some railroad tracks).  Berkeley, thankfully, manages to make the villain menacing and funny at the same time.  The use of current day rock songs in the soundtrack also serve to pump-up the fun quotient.The movie also comes equipped with a sequel-ready ending that guarantees, box office returns willing, that the cast and crew of \"Shanghai Noon\" will ride again.\"', '\"a truly dire piece of cinema, the first was a great flick, intricate clever, action filled and well acted. Well as well as the cruiser can, and to be honest all emmanuel beart did was pout prettily, but this did deflect from her personality void rather effectively. anyhoo, i digress, what bugged me about this is john woo mostly. who i rate highly, though of late have become bored with his indelible mark, which does never really veer away from a collection of set pieces; standoffs with unloaded guns; a hero and a paraiah; while this seems a harsh indictment of an action film as i suppose they are kinda essential qualities for a rootin-tootin action piece. john woo seems to have created a cookie cutter shape that he merely presses against whichever franchise he has been handed that month. kudos to the guy for bringing some of the lyricism of chinese action films to hollywood, but this was a distintcly poor comparison to his earlier stuff\"', '\"That\\'s Don Cheadle\\'s character, Basher Tarr, in my summary quote above, but when I check the cast of characters on the IMDb title page for this movie, he shows up in an uncredited role. No excuse for that, without his \\'pinch\\' contraption, the Ocean crew wouldn\\'t have been able to pull it off.Well, the whole idea is wildly implausible, but just like the 1960 original with Frank Sinatra as Danny Ocean, this is a highly entertaining and often amusing flick. It\\'s probably a toss-up as to which film had the bigger celebrity cast; for me it\\'s hard to top the original Rat Pack. And just like the original, virtually nothing goes wrong in the execution of the plan here to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Not very credible, but if you put that aside, you get lots of commendable support from George Clooney\\'s band of supporting players. Taking things literally though, one must take exception to the movie\\'s brief description, again on the picture\\'s IMDb title page. It refers to \\'Danny Ocean and his eleven accomplices, but if you\\'re paying attention, the eleven includes Ocean himself. If you want to make a case for Julia Roberts, go ahead, but she didn\\'t have anything to do with the caper.With it\\'s writing and flashier style, this 2001 remake does come across somewhat better head to head against Sinatra\\'s crew, but that decision can be made by the viewer. I enjoyed both actually, and this one had enough going for it that it makes me curious to catch the two sequels, Ocean\\'s Twelve and Thirteen. They\\'re coming up soon on my watch list.\"', '\"I Just got out of the movie an hour ago, so am still in partial shockfrom the humongous big and loud special effects, and such a poorstory and directing. However, I also realize that I\\'m being guilty ofthe same kind of ultra-biased reviewing that ticks me off, so I bettermoderate myself. Actually, the first half of the film was prettydarned good in many ways. But in the second half or maybe third,the special effects were the star and focus of the film. I amextremely biased against special effects-starring movies, becausethey are like watching a magician that doesn\\'t even try to hide thesecrets of his tricks. It just seems stupid and a waste of time,causing me to lose all interest. Actually, it usually even turns to afeeling of disgust.  Anyway, I should not burden those who likedthis film so much with my personal bias. So I will try to just give myless biased reasons for nixing this film. To review or gauge aJames Bond film, one has to compare to previous efforts. To me,the last long segment of this movie is the worst Bond film ever- bya longshot. The reason for this is simple- there is very little humaninteraction done in a human manner. Even 007\\'s sexual relationship with Halle Berry\\'s character and the other girl weremerely mechanical at best! What a waste! It is the human elementthat makes Bond films usually so much fun to watch. It\\'s in thebanter. Some are very serious, others are lighter fare- but until thissorry excuse arrived, they all had the human element in common.It is true that some have less of this than others-maybe moreemphasis on gadgets or car chases... but I can\\'t recall any otherswith so little good human interaction- comic, serious, or anythingresembling sympathy or empathy. So about all that is left at theend are special effects and panoramic camera shots with loudsound effects. Madonna is  a pretty good actress, but she only hada bit part. Berry can\\'t act her way out of a paper bag, but she getssecond billing. I do like her personality and of course she looksso incredibly good. But she needs some more time to develop heracting. The good part of this was the first half - because it actuallydid have some good human interaction (but still too little. Why isnothing developed between the beautiful female officer whotortures him and Bond? Little explanation about the scorpions orany details!) But still some good stuff occurs before and after thetorturing scenes. Having Bond become a real renegade and a trulydespised outcast was a nice touch. I\\'ve liked every Bond film thathas come before, because I am a sucker for all that stuff. However,this one brings a new much lower standard. I\\'m sorry to see theseries die such a grotesque death, but maybe it will make acomeback in the future. 007 is sure a tough nut to kill.\"', '\"[Standard Disclaimer--warning, this review may contain spoilers.]I gave it a 3.  The best word to describe this sequel is: NothingI went out to dinner with three friends and two of them wanted to see it. The other had doubts but wasn\\'t opposed to seeing it.  I was heavily opposed to it.  Why?  Because the vast majority of sequels are awful or at the very least mediocre.  Unsurprisingly, two of my friends grumbled after the movie as I gloated.  \"I told you so!\"I didn\\'t dislike MIB 2.  It isn\\'t downright stupid or a complete insult to your intelligence.  The problem is that it lacks a decent plot; it just recycles the same MIB gag that we enjoyed in the first movie.  Except for one worthwhile alien (the one that hovers), it is uninteresting.  The fact that the producers, the director, and the script writer were under pressure to make a sequel is obvious.  It\\'s as though they passed MIB through an automated Hollywood sequel making machine.What\\'s sad is that they could have made a good movie if they had worked up a real plot (not too hard for professional script writers), catered less to children, added a bit of intrigue and suspense, and made the aliens less corny.  Recycling the talking dog did not work.Don\\'t be surprised if MIB 2 hits the second run theaters within a month and a half.  The normally crowded theater I saw it in was almost empty.  Now I know why.\"', '\"All you people out there who don\\'t realise that this film is the best and funniest in history really have no life...yes it has a simple story but that is one of millions of reasons that this is the best film ever ! If I could make a film it would be exactly like this ... PERFECT --- this film is funny from start to finish,mint car chases, and the women - brilliant action, the lot it is awesome just like the first one-- (the second is better though) there is just no room for improvements... all round entertainment. An outstanding film! 10/10. Hope the 3rd one will be wicked too !!! This film will never get old!\"', '\"So I finally got around to seeing the 7th movie in the immensely successful Fast & Furious franchise. I am a big fan of the entire franchise, and even though the latest part (Furious 7) currently gets the highest ratings out of all, the 1st is still my favorite. It has a certain charm that all the sequels lack. As a movie on it\\'s own, much has been said before: The story is rather shallow, it has plot holes-a-plenty and the dialogue makes you cringe, but if you like fast cars and action, you\\'ll most likely enjoy this movie. Nothing new there. But I would like to point out why for me the original The Fast & The Furious is still the highlight of the franchise.First of all, next to being a movie buff, I\\'m also very much a car guy, and from that point of view I can appreciate The Fast & The Furious\\' efforts to try and portray genuine car culture. An aspect that for me has really been missing from the later additions in the franchise. Admittedly for the car-tuning community this movie probably did more bad than good, and car enthusiasts love to rip on all the technical mistakes in this movie, but compared to the later F&F movies, this one actually does quite alright. For example, when Dom (Vin Diesel) shifts his car (a Mazda RX7) into gear at the start of the first race we get to see an elaborate CGI sequence that takes us through the entire drive train of the car. It\\'s a fancy gimmick at first, but re-watching this sequence some time ago I noticed that the engine of the car didn\\'t have pistons. Instead it has rotors. The filmmakers actually took the time to research the fact that RX7\\'s are powered by rotary engines rather than your standard piston engine. We don\\'t see this kind of attention to detail in the later movies and for all it\\'s technical mistakes the 1st Fast & Furious also gets it right in many places.But even apart from these technicalities, The Fast & The Furious has got more redeeming qualities. I find that the original Fast & Furious has the most believable characters compared to the other installments in the franchise. Here we have a group of high-school drop-outs, who grew up together doing their car-thing. They\\'re clearly a close-knit group of friends (a family) kept together by Vin Diesel\\'s leader/father figure. In this context Diesel\\'s character and the entire \"I got family\" thing makes sense. This isn\\'t so much the case in the later movies (especially 5, 6 and 7), where Dominic becomes this stuck-in-the-past guy going on and on about his so called \"family\" who are actually just a group of loosely associated characters that come together on occasion and then go their separate ways again. Don\\'t get me wrong, the all-star ensemble is fun in the action-blockbuster franchise F&F has become now, but below the surface the original still provides most of the drive behind the characters 6 movies later.In a similar way The Fast & The Furious has the best \"bad guys\" from the series as well. I always found Johnny Tran and his gang much more intriguing than any of the other bad boys in the sequels. In every other F&F film the crew rises up against some mafia figure (Verone, Braga, Reyes, etc.) who is evil for the sake of being evil, and who\\'s ultimate downfall is always underestimating this crew of street racers because, you know, they\\'re just street racers, right? It gets rather formulaic. Johnny Tran on the other hand isn\\'t this ultimate bad guy. In fact his actions are rather well motivated. He\\'s not even looking for trouble, like he says: \"You stay away, I stay away. Everybody stays happy\". But then this Torreto guy shows up in his turf again, some guy steals his engines, his whole family gets raided by the police, and to top it off he wins a pink slip fair and square, but the guy drives off. So he\\'s righteously angry and retaliates. Johnny Tran has a reason to be the bad guy, unlike those in later installments.Further more the dialogue is actually one thing that I like about this movie. For better or worse, this movie has become one of the most quoted movies among my friends and family. Like many have pointed out before, the dialogue (especially the tech-talk) isn\\'t the best written, but unintentionally this also adds to the believability of the characters. Go to any car meeting and you\\'re bound to hear guys talking like they know all about cars and engines, while in fact they don\\'t. Just like Dom\\'s infamous victory speech. A lot about this movie is all show and no go, but that\\'s also very much the \"tuning\" scene it tries to portray, in such a way that by now this movie often feels like a time-document, an homage almost, to the ridiculous car-mod culture in those days.Lastly I think The Fast & The Furious deserves a an extra credit for the original score by Brian Transeau (BT). He perfectly captures the atmosphere of the film with his scoring, particularly taking influence from his groundbreaking debut album \"Ima\". The later films lack this quality especially whenever \"Ludacris\" is involved and the entire soundtrack is full of cheesy pop-rap/club music that really doesn\\'t fit the style of the movies at all.So there you have it, 8/10 for the original Fast & Furious film. Well deserved and still the best of the bunch!\"', '\"Three words come to mind, childish, sophomoric and laughable. Not to be confused with funny, humor etc. I was expecting something like the TV series. The women were classy, tasteful and enigmatic. This portrayal made be think of \\'Porkey\\'s\" and \\'American Pie\\'. I would be amazed if a sequel is in the making.\"', '\"In this action filled flick Tom Cruise and co-stars battle desperately against not only sinister villains but also a hopeless script filled with annoyances and plot holes. \"MI:2\", although making top dollars at the box office I\\'m sure, only succeeds halfway in being entertaining, leaving large holes in desperate need of filling. Numerous attempts to fill these holes are made using well choreographed action scenes, I\\'ll give them that, and hopeless, yes they are, plot twists. This results in a mildly entertaining movie with a lot more to be desired.In general, sequels to action movies and the likes, such as Mission Impossible, although not winning any Oscars per se, still often manages to be entertaining in the \"Hey, honey, that was an hour and a half well spent, I had fun\" kind of way. However, Mission Impossible 2 does not succeed even at this, and should therefore be left alone. Tom Cruise fans should go watch \"Eyes Wide Shut\" instead and if your looking for an action filled sequel, hey, it\\'s a jungle out there, and you know it.\"', '\"Sure, this sequel was dumbed down from the not-so-smartoriginal, but it\\'s still a lot of fun.  For once, the stuff Ihate in Woo\\'s films (starting with those damned pigeons) waskept to a minimum, while what he does best (action) was at theforefront.  He even showed some development in the area of humanpsychology.  Be warned, there are some big lifts from Hitchcock(\"Notorious\" and a second villain right out of \"North byNorthwest\"), but the thing moves so fast you won\\'t have time toresent it.Best things in the film besides the action:  Cruise\\'s smile--inthis film his character is very much a danger junkie; his scenewith Anthony Hopkins early on setting up the plot; Ving Rhames\\'return; and, best of the best, Thandie Newton.  Not only is shebeautiful, but she has a wonderfully expressive body and facewith the biggest eyes since Bambi.  She manages to give the filmsome depth without slowing anything down.  I hope this picturemakes her a\"', '\"A handsome secret agent, beautiful women, fast cars and fight sequences, plus a megalomaniac with a fiendish plot to hold the world to ransom: sound familiar? Yes, MI:2 is squarely in James Bond territory. In fact, I couldn\\'t help wondering if MI:2 doesn\\'t amount to a conscious attempt to take over the Bond market niche now that the Bond theme - despite the reinjection of Pierce Brosnan to try to kick some life into the series - is so clearly played-out.In fairness, this is a shrewder idea than having MI:2 follow in the steps of the first \"Mission Impossible\", a movie that tried to be dark and brooding and merely ended up tedious and occasionally baffling. MI:2 is popcorn, but at least it seems to want to be enjoyable popcorn. Unfortunately, the director doesn\\'t appear to have any idea of how to achieve this: as a result, the film simply goes through the motions for a couple of hours, and then gives up.Centre-stage, as ever, is Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. Or is that Ethan Hunt as Tom Cruise? The distinction between star and character can seldom have been more blurred, especially since Hunt doesn\\'t appear to have any kind of personality to call his own. When Tom Cruise performs the free-climbing sequences - Hunt\\'s idea of a holiday - are we watching Ethan Hunt\\'s idea of a holiday, or Tom Cruise\\'s? Of course Tom Cruise is an actor, not a secret agent. But Hunt seems to have so little character, and so few defining characteristics beyond Cruise\\'s boyish good looks, that to all intents and purposes they might as well be one and the same.Cruise, to give him credit, does his best. He smiles and leaps and kicks people and runs and looks nice. Alas, the same cannot be said of Anthony Hopkins, who appears to be acting in his sleep. (He was very nearly acting in my sleep too, but I kept my eyes open somehow). The spectacularly bad lipsync that plagued much of the movie is also at its worst in Hopkins\\' scenes: I felt as if I were watching something that had been dubbed from German.Thandie Newton is another disappointment. The casting agency were apparently given the difficult brief of finding someone prettier than Tom Cruise for him to act with. With the heart-breakingly gorgeous Newton, they clearly succeeded. Her early scenes also suggest that she can act as well. She has the makings of an extraordinary, memorable Bond, er, Hunt Girl. Given free rein, she could probably have transformed the movie. But her role simply dries up partway-through, leaving her little more to do than look hurt and vulnerable for the rest of the film. It\\'s a terrible waste.\\'Wasteful\\' would be a good description of the film as a whole. It\\'s as if the director knows that he won\\'t be asked to direct MI:3, so he\\'s using up all the cliches in the genre while he has his hand on the clapperboard. If the MI series is the new Bond, it\\'s peaking early: two films into the series, it\\'s already fallen into the formula rut. It\\'s also sloppily done: the \\'need-to-know\\' information about the virus is repeated over and over to make sure we\\'ve got it (clue for Hollywood: audiences aren\\'t as stupid as you think they are). The trademarks - Hunt dangling from a rope as in the first movie, and John Woo\\'s pigeons - are fairly trowelled on, and the plot-holes come thick and fast. Most irritating of all, the \\'face-mask\\' gimmick, where characters pull off a latex mask to reveal that they are actually someone else, is repeated over and over, without rhyme or reason. To use this trick once tests the audience\\'s ability to suspend disbelief already: to use it as often as MI:2 does, in such implausible circumstances, is sheer laziness. After a while, you\\'re all but expecting Thandie Newton to rip off her face-mask and reveal that she\\'s actually Anthony Hopkins.Unfortunately, MI:2 takes itself too seriously for that: the only moment when it comes close to self-parody is when villain Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) gives a sardonic commentary on Hunt\\'s plans to infiltrate a building. For the rest, there\\'s little humor in the film (and several of the scarce jokes come across as oddly misogynistic). Tom Cruise\\'s po-faced Hunt can never deadpan the way Bond would, which is bad news for the series: now that Bond movies have become thoroughly formulaic, the occasional dry wit is one of the few redeeming devices they have left. If MI:2 can\\'t even manage that, future sequels will have little to recommend them.Unfortunately, car chases and explosions are no longer enough. Despite all the pyrotechnics and the slow-motion aerial kung-fu, the one truly vivid scene in the film remains the rock-climbing sequence at the start. Without any need for quick-fire action, with no enemies except gravity to fight, it\\'s nonetheless genuinely tense and gripping. If Woo could have offered more scenes like that, MI:2 might have been superb. Alas, it\\'s a solitary high-point: nothing else in the film ever attains that level again.If Mission Impossible wants Bond\\'s crown, tarnished and tired as it is, the makers will need to do better than this. Simply repeating the usual cliches with nicer photography and a bigger special effects budget won\\'t cut it, no matter how cute Tom Cruise may be. If ever there was a series in need of a new direction and some original ideas, this is it.\"', '\"Last year I rented FAST FIVE despite not really caring about the previous flicks. I had only seen the first film when it came out and some of TOKYO DRIFT on TV. I gave the fifth film a shot anyway because the trailers made it look really fun and it got good word of mouth. To my surprise, I enjoyed it. It was a nice fun stunt car heist flick with no pretensions of being anything other than it was.So here I am, watching the first film and I quickly realize why I didn\\'t embrace the series during its initial films. This first installment is basically POINT BREAK with cars, but without The Buse. The first race is pretty fun at first but after that it just didn\\'t do much for me. It takes itself too seriously and Paul Walker isn\\'t really much of a leading man to carry the drama this flick tries to inject with the whole thing with him being torn between friendship and duty. Boring.\"', '\"\"Die Another Day\" is the latest movie in the James Bond franchise.  While it is not the best, it does have its good moments.  As with every James Bond movie, this one is all about the beautiful women, snazzy gadgets and fast-paced action.  Halle Berry plays Jinx, this installment\\'s main Bond Girl.  It may seem inconsistent seeing her in this role so soon after winning the Oscar for her performance in \"Monster\\'s Ball.\"  But she does her best, looking good in little more than a few diamonds.  Rick Yune plays General Zao, a diamond-scarred North Korean renegade.  He certainly puts on the right look for a Bond baddie.  And John Cleese returns as gadget expert Q, giving the right \"mad scientist\" vibe to the role.  Whether you\\'re a 007 devotee or not, \"Die Another Day\" is worth scoping out.\"', '\"I am not one who only likes older Bond movies. I actually think GoldenEye is among one of the best Bonds, and I enjoyed the World is not Enough. I am one of those people who thought A View to a Kill was pretty awesome.But with Casino Royale coming out in 2 months from this day (I think it is the 16th of November), I am reminded of the latest bond film...I saw Die Another Day 4 years ago in theater, and I must say I did not like it at all. Maybe it was the invisible car, or the absence of a reasonable plot that just didn\\'t click with me. The acting wasn\\'t bad, but that didn\\'t save it...it just seemed...stupid. It was different in a bad way.Casino Royale looks rather good, but please do not feel like you should watch Die Another Day in order to get psyched for it. I will say right now it may very well be the worst bond film, in addition to just being a dumb movie in general.3/10 because of the Ice Hotel being pretty cool, John Cleese doing a good replacement job (RIP Desmond), Judi Dench doing wonderful as usual, and the fact that I feel sympathy for poor Pierce having had to bow out with this movie.\"', '\"Action packed. Funny without the 2019 feminist bullcrap.\"', '\"This film is bad, not in the good sense, in the very bad sense. It is a music video, in fact has less depth than music videos and is a filmic fantasy for boy racers. The dialogue is pitiful, boring and clichÃ©d and the characters are little more than pretty cardboard cutouts...including the \"A.D.D.\" sufferer who actually seems to be autistic and not a sufferer of attention deficit disorder.\"', '\"From the beginning to the end, M:I-2 was nothing short than a thrill ride. Throw in a little romance and a great actor in Anthony Hopkins and you got the whole appeal for the movie.  The movie may not have the same attitude than the first one, but it is probably the best movie sequel since Silence of the Lambs.\"', '\"It was a travesty and an injustice to use the Mission Impossible title for this movie. It represented one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated upon the film going public. Since when is Mission Impossible about mindless action and simplistic plots? John Woo has turned what should have been a taut physcological thriller into an unwatchable collection of exagerrated, and therefore stupid, action sequences. Where was the style and substance of the first movie? Where did the logic and intelligence go? As smart as the first one was this is every bit as dumb.\"', '\"It\\'s hard to be really disappointed in this movie. I mean, it tries so hard to please. It\\'s short (VERY short) and there\\'s nothing about it that is really horrible. To be sure, the performances are good. The dog is funny. The aliens are freaky. It\\'s everything we\\'d expect from the team that brought us the original Men In Black, right? Well, no. Not exactly. There\\'s nothing new about this movie. Nothing that expands the world set up in the first movie. It doesn\\'t go off in any new directions. It\\'s basically just a rehashing of the original. Like I said, it\\'s hard to NOT like a movie that features Tommy Lee and Will doing what they do best. But by the same token, it\\'s really hard to LOVE this movie, either.\"', '\"What you got with Men in Black, you get again with Men in Black 2. Jones and Smith saving the universe. And we get plenty of wasted time, because before anyone can be saved Jones must retrieve his lost memory. So, that\\'s fun.We have the same cast, only now with more bad actors added to the good. Lara Flynn Boyle, who has never done anything remarkable since \"Twin Peaks\". Patrick Warburton, who thankfully has a small role because he\\'s worthless outside of \"Seinfeld\". Johnny Knoxville? What has he done for me lately? David Cross returns, this time playing a geeky video store employee with a co-worker who looks a lot like Natalie Portman. I don\\'t mean to ruin it for you, but it\\'s not Portman: it\\'s some unknown named Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine. But she was just as hot, so I guess it doesn\\'t make a difference.Rosario Dawson was great, she was much better here than in \"Rent\" or \"Clerks II\". Her character is similar to the opera singer character from \"The 5th Element\", in a round about way. (Well, it makes sense once you\\'ve seen the movie.) Her role in the grand scheme of things is very interesting (a much better backstory than the weak first movie).I hated the talking dog (Frank). The animation of him talking was urine-poor, and there was absolutely no need for him to sing \"Who Let the Dogs Out\". Most of this country has already forgotten the Baha Men, thank goodness.I thought the product placement was bad in the first film. It\\'s ten times worse here: Sprint, Burger King, Mountain Dew, Marlboro, Bowflex, and Twister. And I felt like the film was a subtle advertisement for \"I, Robot\" with Will Smith fighting robots and aliens... even the directing looked the same (but I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s not).At least one good thing came from this film: the terms \"old and busted\" versus \"the new hotness\". Hurrah. Does this make you want to see the film? Then see it. But you\\'re not missing out if you rent \"Willow\" instead so you can spend more time with your kids.\"', '\"For some reason, I never tire of seeing this film. It\\'s not an academy-award winner, it doesn\\'t make a statement about the human condition, and it certainly doesn\\'t reference anything remotely truthful about real Vegas casinos. What it does do is simply entertain at a first-rate level for roughly two hours. And it\\'s 100 times better than the original offering from 1960.In 1960, several of Hollywood\\'s biggest name talent, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop, turned up in Las Vegas to shoot a movie called \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\". They shot the film by day and played the Vegas strip by night. These live acts proved so popular that the group returned to Vegas many times for years after the sets of the film were torn down and the production moved back to Hollywood. The film was about a Vegas heist by some amateur gamblers, but the live act, made up of the legendary \"Rat Pack\", became ever-associated with Vegas. However, the original \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" does not share the status of the Rat Pack\\'s live offerings of the 1960\\'s. Apparently, while shooting, Frank Sinatra refused to do multiple takes in many scenes as if he was bored with the project, and consequently the final cut of the movie suffered immensely.Fast-forward 40 years. Stephen Soderbergh, on the heels of \"Traffic\", was given a large budget to remake \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\". The cast is a host of current Hollywood notables, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Julia Roberts, and George Clooney as Danny Ocean, the character played by Sinatra. Strangely, the original 1960 production seems like a low-budget bad Vegas show when compared to the 2001 version. Not only is the more recent production much slicker and more finely tuned, the acting and the plot are far more compelling. Sort of like comparing the Flamingo Hotel to the Bellagio or the Venetian Room. There\\'s no comparison.The plot itself is simple enough: Danny Ocean and eleven brilliant but shady characters attempt to enact a heist on one of the major casinos in Vegas. Add to the stew, Tess, played by Julia Roberts, who was previous Ocean\\'s wife but is now hooked with the casino\\'s head-honcho, Terry Benedict, played with mostly cool detachment by Andy Garcia. This is not akin to robbing the Sands Casino when the strip was made up of these little 6-floor casinos where you could get a room for less than 10 bucks. The new version is like trying to rob the MGM Grand where billions of dollars enter the casino every year. The ultimate outcome is an outstanding textbook example of misdirection that is well worth a DVD purchase. It seems unusual today that there are few productions that are both as well-produced AND well-written. Unfortunately, the subsequent sequels do not measure up nearly as well.\"', '\"First part of a saga with Hollywood star-studded and plenty of amusement , entertainment and fun .

This first part is much better than its sequels ,it had a hold up pretty well paced , being followed by Ocean\\'s Twelve (2014) and Ocean\\'s thirteen (2007) with similar cast , technician team and direction .\"', '\"The origin into the FF franchise is just as good as it was 17 years ago. A likeable cast and a good director deliver a a fun, fast paced adventure which is fun from start to finish\"', '\"George Clooney is the reason why you should see this movie, besides the great direction. This movie offers you a time good spent. No bizarre story, no big thoughts, nothing that will keep you pondering on, just an easy evening out. The movie is not worth an Award, but it\\'s worth your money. The fact that there is not much of a violence is refreshing, just a good story.I was surprised how there was no equal to George Clooney, the rest of the cast was in his shadow.\"', '\"It\\'s the impossible movie heist recipe which requires a couple of big-time movie stars, one bad guy, a team, a plan which most likely isn\\'t planned that good, quite a lot of things which should fall conveniently down to luck or chance to happen smoothly, enjoyable music, atmosphere in which the movie takes place, playing illusions with the movie characters and you to reach the final conclusion of how they pulled it off.\\nI remember watching this movie when I was young and I remembered quite a lot of things even watching it now. As a young kid I enjoyed this movie but watching it now I enjoyed it too but I applied logic to make sense of the heist which I shouldn\\'t had.\\nOverall I think it\\'s not an excellent and\\nnot a bad movie. It\\'s somewhere in the middle for casual watching but you shouldn\\'t try to apply logic too much or you will ruin it for yourself.Would recommend to anyone who wants to see one of their favourite movie stars pull off a heist but it wouldn\\'t be my first choice. Overall 7/10\"', '\"When I first heard that Ben Affleck was cast to play Jack Ryan, I shook my head. I have never been a fan of Affleck or his normally lackluster acting, and \"Clear and Present Danger\" is a sorely lacking movie. Using that movie as a template, I went into \"The Sum of All Fears\" expecting an action flick with Ryan author Tom Clancy\\'s usual political subplots. Instead, I saw and heard something much more. \"The Sum of All Fears\" is a thought provoking work of art that is more than worth my money. What I saw was one of those rare films that grab your mind and keeps you thinking long after the credits roll.On the surface, this film could have been a monster failure. It relies less on action than the previous two Ryan films, and involves more politics and emotional drama. Furthermore, incumbent Harrison Ford turned down the offer to reprise his role as the protagonist, so Ben Affleck earned the part. Drama plus Affleck should equal a bad combination, but in this case that equation does not balance.I sometimes wonder if Ben Affleck played hooky in acting class, but, for the first time, I saw him produce a convincing character. No longer is he stone faced and monotonous, but he finally puts some expression into a role. Perhaps it was the script, which was well written and executed by all parties. Maybe it was the director, who brilliantly mixed the ingredients together to bring out a powerful final dish. In any case, we now know that he can be a convincing and likable actor.Morgan Freeman and James Cromwell are my two favorite actors. In fact, my admiration for them is at the same level as Roger Ebert\\'s towards Harry Dean Stanton and M. Emmet Walsh. This movie is their second appearance together, the first being \"Deep Impact,\" a movie which should be ejected into space. Cromwell brings his usual sharpness to the table, literally and otherwise. Freeman shows up with his usual \"Morgan Freeman\" performance, and few compliments are higher.The story begins with the finding of an Israeli nuclear bomb that was lost in 1973. The plutonium is sold on the black market to a European terrorist group bent on sending America and Russia on a collision course for nuclear war. The leaders of both nations are portrayed as peaceful, intelligent individuals agonizing over the decisions they are faced with. Opposite Cromwell is President Nemerov of Russia (CiarÃ¡n Hinds). The interplay between the two is always intriguing. Each desires to trust the other but fears making a critical mistake. Neither wants a war, but they need to defend their people. This is where Ryan, armed with priceless information, comes in.There are also some notable differences between the novel and the movie, such as the affiliation of the terrorists. It is also a prequel to the other Ryan films, a decision that was made when the 30 year-old Affleck was cast. Bridget Moynahan plays the future Cathy Ryan, and manages to be convincing. Her character is laid back, but as a doctor and natural leader she needs to remain perfectly calm. Some may find her personality underwhelming, but with knockout looks like hers it is easy to fall in love with Ryan\\'s girlfriend.As my final point, I would like to give my most sincere compliments to director Phil Alden Robinson, who adds a lot to the film with his use of colors and shadows. He also lends visual symbolism to the worldwide impact of the story with many aerial shots. The special effects are astounding and disturbing. This is all augmented by the best soundtrack of eighteen time Oscar nominee Jerry Goldsmith\\'s career. The action scenes are few and spaced apart, but that factor is immaterial. \"The Sum of All Fears\" is thought rousing drama that stands as the best Jack Ryan movie. Kudos to everyone involved in the making of this gem.\"', '\"Ocean\\'s Eleven (2001) is a comedic film, based on the 1960 film Ocean\\'s 11, about a group of thieves, led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his accomplice Rusty (Brad Pitt) who rob The Bellagio casino in Las Vegas along with two other casinos that feed into its vault. The casinos are all owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) whom Danny has a personal dispute with. They are all very smart people who know how to play outside the law and win. The plot is cunning and The gang of thieves stress and collaborate together to pull off the perfect crime in this clever film. I\\'ve seen this movie many times and every time I watch it, I still admire it. Ocean\\'s Eleven is a witty and funny film that keeps you thinking up until the end of the movie. Every detail is perfectly placed in the movie and I still catch new important clues relating to the plot every time I watch it. It really plays with small details and the relationships that the characters have with each other. There is a perfect balance of fun and seriousness in their job and you can really tell that based on their conversations and interactions with each other. It\\'s a brilliant film that I can watch again and again without boring myself.This film is unique in the way it was filmed and edited. As Rusty and Danny explain exactly what they will be doing according to the plan, this film flashes to them enacting their plot as Rusty and Danny talk about it making it very neatly edited. It tricks you when it comes to time and location, making you really think about what is going on. I also love the cinematography of this film. It takes place in Las Vegas and you really get that when you\\'re watching it. The dim lighting, and glamorous wardrobe selection really conveys what the film is trying to get across, as well as the characters as they are playing different roles. It\\'s really the kind of film that makes you want to rob a Las Vegas casino. And who better than Brad Pitt and George Clooney to rob it with you? The cast is absolutely magnificent. It is picked perfectly with star studded actors. Each actor and actress plays their role exquisitely. The main character are introduced into the film showing exactly who they are and their distinct personality right off the bat, and you love each of the characters instantly. They are all quirky and have their own little comedic mannerisms and actions that just add to the hilarity of the film.I\\'ve seen other con-like robbery movies but this movie really is my favorite. There are even two sequels to Ocean\\'s Eleven and I still keep this one close to heart. This movie reminds me of another robbery film, Inside Man (2006) with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Now this movie is more intense than Ocean\\'s Eleven and is not a comedy like it, but it does share some of the same features. Both of these movies deceive you in the plot just as the characters have deceived their robbery victims. In Inside man, Clive Owen pulls off the perfect bank robbery just as Clooney, Pitt, and their crew did in Ocean\\'s Eleven. I love both movies but I really enjoyed the comedic appeal that the Ocean\\'s Eleven added to something serious like robbing a place. It really makes it more entertaining for the audience and makes you love the quirky characters even more.This movie is simply a delight to watch. I could watch marathons of these movies and still wish I had more to watch. Clooney and Pitt steal the show in this film and lead us through this funny and smart plot effortlessly. The whole idea of this movie is simply gold and the whole cast shows us that throughout every scene. I really think highly of this film and encourage anyone who hasn\\'t seen it to take the time to watch it. I would also suggest watching its sequels, Ocean\\'s Twelve (2004) and Ocean\\'s Thirteen (2007), as they are written just as perfectly as the first one.\"', '\"Used to be all that was good about a Jackie Chan film was the martial arts scenes. Watch Jackie fly through a window! Watch Jackie fight the bad guy on the ledge of a tall building! The story of the movie was pretty much built around the carefully choreographed fight scenes. His latest, Shanghai Noon, has a good story-I think. The story is not so well told, but I was able to piece it all together after I left the theater.It\\'s confusing from the very beginning: Opening in China, a princess (Lucy Liu) is meeting the very undesirable man chosen to be her husband. Among the imperial guards bowing to revere her is Chan\\'s character, Chon Wong, who is smitten with her. He later overhears a conversation between she and her American english teacher about sneaking away to America, where she can find a husband of her own choosing. A scene later, the imperial guards are called together again because the princess has been kidnapped. What? Did I miss something? Chon Wong gets to tag along with the other imperial guards traveling with the ransom of jewels and gold to New Mexico. A scene or two later, the princess arrives at a Chinese workers\\' camp where, you guessed it, she\\'s kidnapped. Then the train carrying Chon Wong and the other imperial guards is held up by a group of bandits led by Roy O\\'Bannon (Owen Wilson). Jackie Chan-style stunts and martial arts scenes ensue. The storytelling doesn\\'t improve.I had fun at this movie, but only because of some funny physical comedy and a few well-staged action sequences. Its creators never figure out a way to bring the plot together in a way that keeps the story flowing. In a word, it\\'s sloppy. The plot is so clunky that instead of taking you for a ride, it drags you behind the horse.To its credit, it never intends to be taken too seriously. The biggest laughs come from lines aimed at the now-extinct genre, the western (although, Wilson\\'s line that, even if you didn\\'t see the movie, you probably saw in the trailer, `John Wayne? That\\'s a terrible cowboy name!\\' bombs. John Wayne was an actor\\'s name, not a cowboy\\'s). No convention of the old westerns is safe here: the quick-draw showdown, the train robbery scene, the bar fight scene, the cowboy/indian rivalry are all given pies in the face. The time to stop picking on this genre, I have to say, has come. Please stop.The film has a few new things to say about racism and prejudice, about learning to accept those who are different than us, and having the courage to stand up for change if the existing system is wrong. In other words, this film\\'s target audience, teenagers, will enjoy this movie and might actually take a positive thing or two from it.Grade: C+\"', '\"Samuel L. Jackson is not so much on fire as burning down whole blocks in this film. Okay, the plot isn\\'t anything special, and the story isn\\'t fabulous, but the acting and the presentation make for superb entertainment. Vanessa Williams and Toni Collette do a good job next to Jackson, but he really does steal the show as the original Shaft. His one liners are very cool, and you can\\'t help but smile, and when justice is metered out you could almost cheer. Great entertainment.\"', '\"Oh i so wanted not to like this film, i wanted to slate it for the acting and the premise of another 70\\'s Tv remake but after watching this i can\\'t. Ok the the story is non existant and extemely far fetched but that is part of the attraction. The 3 stars are very good , they look beautifull ( especially Drew!)the stunt work looks spectacular and the special affects are out of this world. In fact they are wasted in Charlies Angels , they should have been saved for a film with substance. There are some very funny moments and there are some very silly or even stupid moments but you have to ride over them and take the film for what it is .A throw away , entertaining , box office smash. 7 out of 10.\"', '\"If you like action, fighting, cool effects, and a beautiful woman, this movie is amazing.  It has action moves that I\\'ve never seen before and a woman that hushes the audience.  If you want a sophisticated plot with maximum realisticness (which is pretty rare in any movie these days) go see something else. If you are going to be picky about the unrealisticness or lack of plot depth you aren\\'t going to like it and you\\'ll be wasting your time, Go to be entertained.\"', '\"A great movie but was disappointed to see most of the funny parts and indeed most of the highlights of the movie in the trailer. A good idea for promoters to get bums on seats in cinemas but disappointing in the fact that I felt I was not seeing anything new.In future, I will try to avoid seeing movie previews anymore than I have to.\"', '\"Plot; A young deskbound CIA analyst is pulled into action when America\\'s already tense relationship w/Russia is tested by the machinations of a fascist splinter group plotting a new world order.The first attempt to reboot Tom Clancy\\'s Jack Ryan character/universe, The Sum of All Fears is a thriller w/o thrills. Though reasonably competent in most respects, it never makes more than a fleeting emotional purchase nor hits a sustained stride. The size of the stakes matter little if you don\\'t first care about characters and the outcome should they fail, and here I just never did.\"', '\"Lets get straight to the point.  This is by far the worst \\'Bond\\' filmever made.  For those who are aware of the past 19 films, thereshould be no debate on this matter.From the opening titles (and the quite dreadful Madonna themetune, which has about as much to do with Bond as monogamy), Iknew that nothing could save this movie.  With a plot, more or lessstolen from \\'The Man with the golden Gun\\' (a villain who imaginedhimself to be the opposite equal of Bond), with his plans to savethe world from an energy crisis by concentrating the sun\\'s energy. A machine, which also has a useful by-product, of a high poweredlazer.With a maximum of 1000 words, it would be difficult to point out allthat is wrong with this film as a \\'Bond\\' film.  Bond is not a superhero (he never has been), Villains are usually charismaticintellectuals, not just sadistic thrill seekers.  Bond girls do notusually (knowingly) help bond.  We know bond is technically anassassin, but this is a fact that has never been pointed out, exceptpainfully in  this film.  Also (perhaps no coincidence given wherethe money comes from) the painful \\'pro American\\' theme runningthrough the film is totally out of character.It could be, or should be, that Bond has reached the end of theline.  One of the elements which makes a Bond film special is theinnocence of the time (60\\'s to early 70\\'s).  The lack of specialeffects, which made the stunt scenes and action scene real, andtherefore believable.All of this is without mentioning the lackluster sexual innuendo andsuggestion that Bond sleeps with every female he meets, is thescript writer pre-school one has to wonder.  Previously Bond\\'sinnuendo\\'s were smart and witty, while his sexual practises wheresubtle in the execution.  We (meaning people with more than amodicum of intelligence) do not need to be shown people havingsex, to know that is what is happening.In a time where the psychological drama is a popular genre ismore popular than ever, why do the producers have to make a\\'Pop\\' action film, where effects drive the plot, while the plot is ainvisible as an invisible Aston Martin.Only one for those who don\\'t know what Bond, means.  It\\'s just anaction film, and not a very good one at that.  Save your money andrent any pre 1980 bond on DVD\"', '\"Although the film is quite good, I think the first one was better because it was clever and actually required some brain to understand it.I think the action in \\'II\\' is good but the storyline is fairly flat. The makers of the film tried to make it too much like a James Bond film and not stick with the more intelligent aspects of it. If they could have combined the two styles then it would have been one kick ass film, but as they didn\\'t it left me feeling rather disappointed after the first film. It seemed to be a bit of a \\'Cruise\\' show, which is always bad in films. Films that just focus entirely on one person are hardly ever good.\"', '\"After watching the film I am amazed. Pierce Brosnan is the best man to have played the character and Die Another Day shows him at his best playing it.Die Another Day did not feel like a James Bond film, a lot of new ideas were thrown in. Best example would be with the movie\\'s intro clip which did not consist of the traditional successful mission with 007 escaping victorious, instead the complete opposite. The mission is compromised and after killing one of the leading terrorists, he is captured and held captive for 14 months.Pierce was born to play James Bond. He is very slick even in the heavy action scenes (apart from when he forgot to stretch and pulled a muscle during early production lol). The dialog in Die Another Day is more humorous than ever and Pierce Brosnan carries out a very natural, masterful performance to deliver it.John Cleese has been one of my memorable stars for years and others like myself in Britain are proud that he is now in the James Bond films ensuring displays that will be remembered world-wide. John Cleese is brilliant as the new \\'Q\\'. The relationship between \\'Q\\' & James Bond is maintained in the traditional warm and humorous manner as \\'Q\\' presents the most lovable car yet.The computer graphics are stunning and quiet obviously the best to have ever been seen in a James Bond film. The credits intro with Madonna\\'s quality theme song clearly demonstrates this, representing the new style of a James Bond film. It doesn\\'t just show transitions of dancing girls like the others all did, but Die Another Day\\'s intro includes the mix of computer animation and footage of James Bond being beaten and held captive. Very clever.Brilliant film. The acting, script, story, graphics, music, the gadgets, cars and ladies. Everything about Die Another Day is brilliant. Go for it...watch it and enjoy it.\"', '\"It made me laugh, it made me cry...no no, wrong review.  While MIB II isn\\'t Star Wars or anything, it was a great movie.  I have to say that I am in an uproar that the love interest isn\\'t scantily clad.  There was so much natural beauty that skimpy clothes were not necessary.  Now, yes, the bad guy(girl) WAS dressed in a Victoria\\'s secret style, it was truly not the normal guys drooling over her and such.There were A LOT of funny jokes in this one, and even a time when it was sad, which was totally unexpected, but I have to say that I think this one is much better than the first.I suggest viewing this movie, if only to see for yourself, but whatever you do, don\\'t eat gummy worms when watching this...yuck!!Oh, and there are several cuss words, and some very, well, gross scenes, I do not suggest taking small children.ENJOY!!\"', '\"First an apology to all you loyal Shaft fans, I am not a fan of the old Shaft but I can appreciate a good film for it\\'s time. I am sorry to say that this was very much a disappointment for a Sam Jackson film  made in year 2000. Frankly I was expecting a lot more from the movie as a whole and I was expecting more from the plot even half way through the movie.A racist killer who killed only one person and while trying to convict him about a dozen more were killed... logic people? I can see the point of \"an eye for an eye\" but this is more like \"12 eyes for an eye\". Sam Jackson was pretty cool at certain moments and Christian Bale played a good, though a little beat of a dÃ©jÃ\\xa0 vu role. But the negative parts of the movie far out weighed the positive. I feel like I should like it, you know, if nothing else for the fact that it\\'s a remake of a classic and the fact that I\\'ve liked all Sam Jackson\\'s work. Maybe it\\'s the expectation factor, perhaps one would enjoy it more than I did if he/she had read my review first and expected the worst.\"', '\"People have told me that this movie wasn\\'t great, but because of my abnormal enjoyment of movies, I thought I would really like it.  Well, I was wrong. The premise is good, but the execution was bad.  As usual, Will Smith was great, good special effects, and pretty funny stuff.  But, on the other hand, it was too short, boring and just some of the same old stuff.  I heard that the cast and crew were working on the screenplay for a long time. Honestly, I expected better.  See this movie, but don\\'t expect anything too good.\"', '\"Ok,I just got back from watching MIB II and all I can say is, why did I waste my time? I should\\'ve waited for it to come on DVD. MIB 2 picks up 5 years after the first. This time around Lara Flynn Boyle is the baddie, who\\'s acting was truly worse than her character. Each of the characters seemed lost within a world that both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith created in the first movie. I felt that it was totally rushed and there was no continuity throughout the picture.It was nice to see Peter Graves in the film. I honestly thought that he\\'d passed on, but lord and behold, he\\'s alive and well. There were elements within this film that I thought were good. Frank the dog was great comic relief, and the \"worm guys\" were cool for a chuckle or two.\\nThe dissapointment came from the main characters, Jones and Smith. Each seemed to be trying to find more than the \"light\", they were trying to find the characters. Jones truly was not in character as \"K\" and Smith was trying to hard to be \"J\".I truly felt that the story could\\'ve been better. The whole idea that K was in love with someone else just doesn\\'t fit with his whole \"view his love from a distant\" in the first. Barry Sonnefeld shouldn\\'t be blamed for the directing, the film editor should\\'ve been fed to the worm in the sewer.Don\\'t go and see this in the theatre, and if you have, build yourself a neuarlizer and zap yourself to forget this dissapointment.\"', '\"I have seen all of the Bond films and I must say that the best Bond is still Connery.  I do think that Pierce should have been before Dalton but I know about the controversy there.  Anyway on to the movie.  This movie was actually the best Bond that Pierce has done.  It was full of action and kept me interested although most Bond movies are very predictable in a way who cares.  The only flaw was the fact that they tried to make him do stunts that are not only unbelievable but impossible.  Also the witty banter between Bond and Jinx was a little too much.Besides those things this is all you can expect in a good Bond film.  It definitely redeems the horrible acting of World is Not Enough.  Go out and see this film fans of Bond.  Go Now.\"', '\"I didn\\'t like the first one, but the sequel is worse. Will Smith was horrible but Tommy Lee Jones was great. The plot sucked, Rip Torn was terrible, and The directing was... bad. \"Men In Black 2\" makes \"Bad Company\" look Shakespearean.I recommend this film to MIB freaks. I give this film a 3 out of 10.\"', '\"Watch this movie! It\\'s been 20 years but still just so good! It is filled with comedy, action, emotions, and a great story! A wild wild ride back to the wild wild west. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are geniuses.\"', '\"It\\'s not MIB 1- which was incomparable in many ways. The humour wasn\\'t as hard hitting and the aliens were not as compelling to watch. Definitely can give this a miss unless you were a die-hard MIB 1 fan.\"', '\"This movie achieved what it was meant to achieve: amazing action sequences and special effects. I think the effects and CGI in this movie may be the best to date. \"King Kong\" is one of the only competitors that comes to mind. This movie isn\\'t supposed to be deep, make you think, or leave you feeling inspired. It\\'s just supposed to be funny, fun to watch and action- packed. And it most certainly is all of those things. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reprise their roles as police trying to take down a drug kingpin. But the plot really isn\\'t important. If you like action and are sick of corny effects that simply don\\'t look realistic, this one\\'s for you.\"', '\"I suppose I should have known what I was in for, considering the last fifty films from this series that never dies.  It\\'s the series that never dies, except for the Bond woman in every movie, and Mr. Bond himself every ten years or so. So, considering it IS a *Bond* movie, and there *are* certain suspensions of disbelief required in order for it so be a *Bond* movie...\\nI suppose that this film is alright.  There are fights, there is sex (although, as our society requires immediate satisfaction, Halle Berry and Pierce Brosnan are all over each other approximately three minutes into her onscreen arrival), and oh yes, there are more excuses to use the most fabulous special effects never to look like waves [see also, THE PERFECT STROM]!  It satisfies every post-modern baby\\'s dream come true! \\nMy favorite part is how the scriptwriter (or the director, or maybe the actress herself) creates such wonderful taglines for Ms. Berry as \"Yo mama, and I bet she\\'s disappointed witch you!\"  Need we be reminded that she is black?  YES!  because ordinarily, upstanding Scotsmen (or Brits) don\\'t consort with that type, but since it\\'s post-Women\\'s lib, and post-Civil rights movement now, I suppose it\\'s allowable to let a black actress bed our right-hand man.  But, she\\'s got to be aggressive, and snappy, and not really a fully-developed character.  No, let\\'s leave the fleshing-out to the white woman.But, aside from all of these things, I thought this was a fabulous film! You had Madonna in a shirt not intended to remind us that she is 45 and buffer than James, you had a bad white guy who was really a bad Asian guy who was really trying to take over the world, and you had America and the United Kingdom coming to the rescue (along with the help of a few fine specimens of vehicular artistry)!  We remember.  We will remember you!\"', '\"OK this movie is so perfect It has the silly stuff from the comic book And the characters are more interesting than usual I love the Michael Jackson cameo The villain is so unexplained creepy and random type like the comic Don\\'t listen to the haters they did not enjoy because they didn\\'t read the comic book\"', '\"After watching this movie I wasn\\'t sure whether the movie\\'s budget ran out or what. How could anyone put out a movie that is shorter than 85 minutes and expect people to pay 9 dollars to see it. Second, I don\\'t know who was responsible for creating the trailer but they need to be commended. Not only can you avoid seeing the movie all together but by watching the trailer, you can catch all the best jokes. And how many times have we all seen the trailer? ..enough so that the best jokes were reciteable. Save your money..\"', '\"Awesome remake of a classic. George and Brad did justice to the original characters. George and Brad oozed class and pure sexuality. I was not a Clooney fan until now. Anyone who\\'s a fan of these two men must see this movie!\"', '\"Several scenes in this film are absolute riots--breaking out of jail comes to mind, as does the bathtub scene--and the rest range from cute to mildly amusing.  It\\'s not as good as some of Jackie\\'s other films (Rush Hour and Rumble in the Bronx are my personal favorites), but it\\'s definitely worth the price of a ticket if you like either Chan or westerns.  So long as you don\\'t go in expecting to be blown away, you\\'ll have a very enjoyable couple of hours.\"', '\"Ah, the old days. I miss them. Back when Bond was suave and bold and a plot was found in the movie. This current movie seems more like my nephew\\'s video game than a film. Too much of everything but what I want. The plot was non-existent, the title song was something out of a Yoko Ono nightmare, the special effects poor at a best and the gimmicks too ludicrous to even enjoy. Even with Q and M appearing, I only give the movie an F.\"', '\"Almost everything in this big-budget borer has been done before and done better, in such as the moribund James Bond franchise, the original MI TV series and action/adventure films too numerous to mention.Neither Mr. Cruise nor Ms. Newton are convincing in their roles, screenwriter Towne et al. presumably suffered an acute case of writers block, and director Woo recycles his bag of now-familiar violent action tricks and clever camera angles. The only bright note here is a cameo by Anthony Hopkins, who in reference to Ms. Newton\\'s need for training, has the best line in the film.While one may wonder why actors of the calibre of Hopkins, Derek Jacobi and Judi Dench appear in such trash, presumably it is for the same reason that this vacuous socky-choppy flick was made - money, money, money!\"', '\"WARNING: SHORT SPOILERThis is one of the saddest sequels I\\'ve ever seen.  *Extremely* unbelievable.  The first M:I was more of a spy flick, where the plot was about coverups, conspiracy, etc.  This one was like an ignorant movie where they just shot each other and blew stuff up.  The part where Stickell almost died is stupid.  He opened the van door with 1 second left on the bomb and the explosion destroyed all the cars around it, and he only ended up w/ some torn clothing!  No new gadgets either, except for that \"voice-changer\" strip.  The best part was probably the part where Eathan desguised himself as the henchmen, and tricked Ambrose (the bad guy) into shooting his own henchmen.  Oh, and the cycle chase.  The ending of the chase was gay though. They were going head on at a ramming speed of about 120 MPH, slam into each other, and survive!  Then they fall off of a 30-foot cliff, after which neither is hurt!Overall, 3 out of 10.\"', '\"tom Clancy knows if he writes it, they will film it. with the 4000 other Clancy novels with success on screen, why let them die. Harrison ford is too old to keep playing a role. with all the many Ryan films Harrison has worn the part out, left nothing to be done. cant use ford anymore, so lets try a new hunk actor and hope he can show the younger side of jack Ryan. the script was written basically to make money, not to be a great movie. the acting, from Morgan Freeman to Affleck do a credible job. this movie has action and dramatics in it which make you question yourself. If I were put in this situation, how would I handle it? some scenes were strictly movie fantasy. with the nuclear halo going off, Ryan\\'s chopper crashes, but everyone else but he dies. a nice film, would have been better if the love story would have unfolded more. cant get enough of the doctor, she was pretty as well as a nice actor.\"', '\"As the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (and every other provincial, back-slapping institution for the purveyance of \"arts\") quite often does, another faux-prestigious award needs to be invented for the sole purpose of giving it to just one guy: The Most Embarrassing Fake British Accent Of All Time Â– awarded to Don Cheadle in \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\". Surpassing even Keanu\\'s Idiot-British in \"Bram Stoker\\'s Dracula\" or \"Much Ado About Nothing\", \"inauthentic\" would be a compliment to Cheadle\\'s uneducated abomination of the mother tongue. Cheadle played Sammy Davis Jnr. in the TV movie \"The Rat Pack\" Â– a role which called for the most talented actor of The Pack, as he had to mime not only singing, but tap-dancing, trumpet-playing and six-gunning, so it is with great concern that we view this exemplary actor\\'s abject ignorance and lack of perception of one particular inflective tongue, based on his own spoken language! (Well, actually, *preceding* his spoken language, but this ain\\'t the forum for resolving etymological beefs.)Still, casting Cheadle as a warbling limey was only nominally more sensible than casting the shovel-mouthed Julia Roberts as a \"beautiful woman\". And as casting choices go, this movie was at a disadvantage from the outset with the impossible task of filling the shoes of one Francis Albert Sinatra. In a role which Frank insouciantly tossed off as a lark (which cast all the more sheen on it for its rebellious bent), head-waggling George Clooney steps up as Danny Ocean. And fails.With \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\", as with \"Robin and the Seven Hoods\", or \"Jailhouse Rock\", or \"Every Which Way But Loose\", we\\'re not so much dealing with \"movies\" as we are with \"movie STARS\". (In sooth, this 2001 \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" observes that tradition with the wealth of wasted talent deployed in it.) Re-making films such as these will not capture the consecrated quality afforded the originals by the passage of time and the involvement of their particular god-status icons. It is merely a fiscal exercise, involving brand-name recognition (buy the original rights and wretchedly sully the nostalgia), curiosity quotient (we\\'ll get the Frank & Dino fans into the theater at least *once*), next-generation retro hipness (\"I\\'m so kewl cos I like the \"classics\"), crossover marketing (with this ensemble, we\\'re *bound* to get *someone* through the turnstiles) and providing A-List actors with work to keep them off reality shows. The premise to heist major casinos in Las Vegas is the only tie with the original \"Eleven\", as this remake\\'s storyline had to be noticeably updated to cater to the state of advances in hi-tech security, the writers sensibly eschewing re-creating The Rat Pack\\'s lo-tech heist note for note.Of the heist gang, Brad Pitt is Clooney\\'s \"Dino\"; Matt Damon meanders one- dimensionally, Bernie Mac does his \"black thing\"; Cheadle does his \"cockney(?) thing\"; excepting Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner, the remainder of the Eleven are populated by \"passengers\", including Ben Affleck\\'s brother and James Caan\\'s son gaily taking on half-dimensional roles.Maybe it\\'s just admiring that previous generation\\'s devil-may-care tilt at Life (or at least, the *media\\'s* reporting of it) that gives the 1960 \"Eleven\" more of a rose-colored flare than all the gadgetry and gags this remake offers as collateral. Though there are attempts at capturing the magic and camaraderie of the original (Clooney\\'s best line to Pitt, \"Ted Nugent called Â– he wants his shirt back\"), this movie\\'s redemption is in its slick production value Â– it may ring hollow as a buddy-piece, but it is truly a guilty ocular pleasure, highly watchable for its appealing camera-work, lighting and set design. Inadvertently turning this piece into a *nolo contendre* flame-fest, I might as well fire home the last barb in stating that the original \"Eleven\" packs a hilarious, if not frustrating, twist ending - unequivocally a more substantial wallop than the anchor that this remake is built on: the interpersonal fizzle of George & Julia\\'s latent love. Let\\'s face it, an action-comedy movie with an ending where Nothing Happens leaves us holding the proverbial injured aquatic bird (i.e. lame duck). With this ensemble, one would expect roiling acting chops flung at the viewer like raw meat to lions, but the only players who consistently chew their roles delectably are Andy Garcia (as the casino owner heistee), Gould and Reiner. Everyone else is flailing for substance, including Pitt and Clooney who only have a few good moments together; the rest of the time, they\\'re just being Brad Pitt and George Clooney, vying for enough screen time to try to top each other for one of those provincial, back-slapping, faux-prestigious awards that already exists: People Magazine\\'s World\\'s Sexiest Man.My vote is for Frank Sinatra.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)\"', '\"I went to see this film with high hopes due to being suprised in how good the first one was, boy was i unhappy with what i witnissed....This film was really bad, giving it credit, the 1st half was a little better than the 2nd half.  I went to see it with a friend, he liked it funny enough, but i only think he said that due to being a big fan of limp bizkit. The only plus point was Thandie newton, she was absolutely stunning (that is looks and not acting).On a leaving note, did Cruise really need to flip himself so much to perform so many stupid stunts, i.e. kicking a bad guys gun out of his hand, so what does he do, thats right, he flips himself 360 degrees and just catches the gun.  What would it of looked like if the bad guy moved and he fell on his back staring up at the bloke pointing and laughing...we can only hope for a better 3rd??4/10\"', '\"Cruise is still the man. Mission Impossible rocked!Tom Cruise and John Woo make a great team. The action scenes are amazing. The movie has a few confusing parts but that doesnt make the movie bad.MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 is the best action movie of the summer.\"', '\"I can suspend my disbelief in a sci-fi movie, or in a good comedy. As long as the world portrayed is consistent with itself, I have no problem.But when a movie that pretends be a cautionary tale of what may happen, presents an implausible plot, the only thing I can do is laugh.MINOR SPOILER: The movie starts with a fighter/bomber plane carrying an atomic bomb that crashes and somehow no one searches for it. Anywhere in this world a plane crash would lead to a search & rescue being sent, especially when the stakes are so high. Not in this movie. END SPOILER.The characters are underdeveloped and cliched. Everything is pure Hollywood. The movie doesn\\'t even point out that in the event of a nuclear war, it doesn\\'t matter who strikes first, since immediately after the launch the other side would launch their missiles too, so in the end there are no winners, only losers.\"', '\"After re-watching Casino Royale yesterday, I\\'m really struck by the wildness of the action, the villains, and the overall plot of Die Another Day. In Pierce Brosnan\\'s last outing as 007, we get the kind of super-villains and super-villainous plot that can only possibly exist in a Bond movie. The movie starts in North Korea in the middle of a shady diamond exchange. The movie\\'s opening action sequence is great, and it is unusual because it ends with Bond being captured and imprisoned for an extended period of time. Years, it looks like. Eventually, the British arrange for his release by agreeing to release a North Korean terrorist named Zao, who is also the only person who knows who betrayed Bond in North Korea in the first place. As Bond sets off on a personal quest to re-capture him and discover who betrayed him, he is led to the mysterious billionaire Gustav Graves, whose involvement in diamond trading is for the sake of the development of a massive satellite with a diamond-encrusted solar panel capable of harnessing and concentrating the energy of the sun, creating a laser beam powerful enough to destroy anything on earth in its path. There is also a bizarre sub-plot involving a high-tech procedure which can alter a person\\'s DNA and completely change their appearance, basically transforming any person into any other person. Zao undergoes this procedure early in the film but is interrupted in the middle of it, which is why one of the villains is a Asian man with sky blue eyes, albino skin and scars all over his face. Interesting, but as we can see from Toby Stephens\\' performance as the psychotic Graves, special effects and make-up are totally unnecessary to have a good villain.It\\'s too bad that all of the supposedly North Korean characters are so inauthentic. I\\'ve always thought that, in situations like this, it\\'s always best to just have them speak their native language and give us subtitles, but evidently the film\\'s producers have no faith in the American audience\\'s attention span, so all of them speak not only perfect English but perfect American English and all authenticity goes flying out the window.Nevertheless, the special effects are generally good and there are plenty of great action sequences. There\\'s also a great location in Iceland of a building made of ice, and even a cool car chase through it. Of course, Iceland is actually green, while Greenland is full of ice, but there you have the producers\\' dumbing down the movie for an ignorant audience again. There is some cool technology in the movie, too, particularly Bond\\'s Aston Martin, which now has an invisibility function. Definitely the most expensive 007 film starring Pierce Brosnan, although not necessarily the best.By the way, I have to ask a question. At one point Bond is driving his car through the ice house and he flips over, sliding along on his roof. He opens the sunroof and hits the Ejection Seat button, and the cars pops back over onto its wheels. Wouldn\\'t the Ejector Seat have just shot him head first into the ice?\"', '\"After three very good films as 007, I think Pierce Brosnan did deserve a better farewell than this film.Yes, the producers tried to make a good Bond movie out of it, but they only succeeded partially. The sword fight between Bond and Graves is very exciting, and Rosamund Pike plays a brilliant role. However there also are some downers, just to name a few:The ice castle of Graves looks more like some sort of fantasy land instead of the real world and this film has one of the most weird villain deaths. Not to mention the Nort Korean colleague of Graves who doesn\\'t perform that well in the film. The only fun moment where he appears is the car chase on the ice.Also the focus in this film is too much on being spectacular which takes you away from the story. The producers tried to cover up the weak storyline with a car chase, a big ice palace and the weirdest weapon ever used by a Bond villain. This all doesn\\'t quite contribute to the film in a good way.However, the bikini scene with Jinx Johnson (Halle Berry) made some fans feel better...\"', '\"I do not see why this is considered to be such a bad movie, most bonds where they try and make different like moonraker, and licence to kill ( moonraker was terrible!), but this attempt to make a bond film different was a succsesful attempt! maybe you old people hate this film so much, because you just can\\'t get use to the modern world. haillie berrie, did excellent job at being a female james bond, the gadgets, were way over the top but thats what makes it so enjoyable. I do not see anything wrong with the story, in fact I think it is a good one. and John Cleese makes an excellent replacement as the role of Q. at least give this movie at try.\"', '\"When I first heard that John Woo was doing another movie, I thought great. When I heard that it was mission: impossible 2, I thought awesome.  When I learned on Tuesday before it came out that 40 minutes had been cut out, I became leery.  Yes, you heard me right, this is not the director\\'s cut of the movie.  OK, maybe it is, but it is not the first cut.  Apparently the first cut was patent John Woo with more violence, going for an \\'R\\' rating, and much less romance.  It was John Woo, but then the studio brought in a guy who cut 40 minutes out, and added some romance between the two characters.  But enough of that, the actual movie review:This is not John Woo.  It had some parts in it that were great, but the movie\\'s pacing was sort of off, and the action scenes were a bit choppy. The rhythm that Woo generally has is absent.  See the scene in Face/Off featuring Somewhere over the rainbow for a good example of that, or the church.  But Woo is a master, and studios should not tough that.  The plot is inane, but I didn\\'t care.  My point was that it should have been fun and more intense.  Either way, I don\\'t think that I could sit through this again, except for if they restore it.  I can\\'t wait for the DVD, maybe they restored the first cut, but until then see Gladiator.  I sat through that twice, and would go again.----5\"', '\"Well for that time it still such a good movie mmmmmmmmm\"', '\"The female lead, touted for the first fifteen minutes of the film as a tough action star to match Tom Cruise, soon ends up being a victim of bastardized Ã¼berchivalry gone horribly awry. She gets tossed from man to man, getting no part in any of the action, offering her life for the man she loves in a sappy fit of blind devotion. Oh yes, she\\'s saved by all the valiant men at the end, have no fear. Why is it that John Woo thinks he\\'s making powerful moral statements when in fact he\\'s only making a flaccid action flick? No amount of doves flying through flames in slow-motion can make this movie any more of a statement about good and evil than it is. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a miss.\"', '\"A true mystery for the rest of society to ponder: how this movie could possibly be so popular, with its preposterous plot and truly awful acting. I\\'m really not sure which is worse, but I do know this: STAY AWAY FROM THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS.\"', '\"Diamonds, DNA or doomsday? Writers, please make up your minds. This story feels like the nervous (or lazy) agglomeration of too many ideas, too many opinions, and not nearly enough good sense. Had the very surprising anti-British/American angle taken up in the opening scene been retained, this could have been a vastly more entertaining night out. But it\\'s a Bond film, after all, so provocative subtext is quickly swept aside to make way for hot chicks, cool gadgets, and a one-dimensional megalomaniac villain with Â– surprise, surprise Â– some freakish henchmen and a doomsday device up his sleeve (this time, quite literally). But while it hits all the traditional Bond notes, it somehow just doesn\\'t play. Halle Berry is wasted, as are Rick Yune and relative newcomer Rosamund Pike (\"Grace Kelly bio-pic, here I come.\") Brosnan goes through the motions capably enough (copious chest-hair notwithstanding), but Toby Stephens is simply laughable as the villainous Gustav Graves. It doesn\\'t help that he plays him uncannily like Rik Mayall\\'s Lord Flasheart from \"Blackadder\". Even the trademark, innuendo-laced dialogue is surprisingly flaccid Â– ironically, it now sounds like an \"Austin Powers\" script, but without the nerve go all the way. The digital effects are far too obvious (only the climactic sequence really impresses), but it\\'s the \"stunts\" they\\'re used to create that really annoy Â– Bond\\'s escape from the iceberg goes too far, even for this franchise of cinematic impossibility. As in the \"Star Wars\" prequels, it isn\\'t so much the quality of the effects which grates Â– it\\'s the low quality of the writing they\\'re trying to represent. With so many Bond parodies and knock-offs crowding the market these days Â– from the deliberately funny (\"Austin Powers\") to the unintentionally hilarious (\"xXx\") Â– the original franchise is going to have to do much more than just trade on its name. It can\\'t be that hard. Just start with a decent script.\"', '\"I\\'ve never ever seen a director so bad at directing an actress as John Woo was at directing Thandie Newton. I am without words for how badly he handles who I consider one of the most underrated actresses of her generation. The only person who is more blatant at this was Michael Bay directing Transformers, when he had Megan Fox posing on the motorbike. I\\'ll come right back to this. Mission Impossible 2 opens with some guy doing some darn impressive climbing scenes in the mountains. I say some guy because whilst he looks like Ethan Hunt and sounds like Ethan Hunt - this guy is most certainly not Ethan Hunt. John Woo takes the frenetic, high-octane guy that we\\'ve seen in every other film and ramps the charisma up to 11 and turns down everything else. They could\\'ve taken Tom Cruise out and replaced him with Pierce Brosnan and honestly it would\\'ve felt more right. Hunt is too flirty and suave in this film - Cruise is at his best when his back is against the wall (as in the other four Mission Impossibles, where he has been a rogue agent), so to have him carrying out a fairly basic IMF mission means that the tension is gone from him. This is just another mission to him, and it shows in his lack of energy at times.To pair with Cruise is Newton, who I really enjoyed watching. She\\'s gorgeous, dignified and even a bit catlike in her thieving scenes (if only there was more than one in the entire film). However, after Hunt recruits Hall (and bangs her for fun), he is told by his boss that Newton\\'s role is just to pretend to be the villain\\'s girlfriend. Hunt\\'s reaction to this news is about what I imagine Newton\\'s was. \"I thought we were recruiting her for her talent\" he snarls, barely able to conceal his contempt. Again, this is pretty much how I felt whenever I watched awful, sexualised scenes of Newton - whether its unnecessary cleavage camera work, or her asking Hunt \"what are you going to do, spank me?\" in the middle of a tense confrontation. Splice in the porn-quality score and suggestive camera work, and Mission Impossible suddenly changes genres.Hunt\\'s mission is to have Hall infiltrate Sean Ambrose\\'s confidences. Of course, many are suspicious of this, including Ambrose\\'s loyal henchman Stamp (Richard Roxburgh, who can\\'t seem to decide on an accent). Ambrose himself is aware that Hall is probably a mole, but he goes along with it because he\\'s a sex-crazed psychopath (quote, \"I am gagging for it\"), and when Stamp dares to ask if he\\'s sure, Ambrose politely agrees and cuts off Stamp\\'s finger for some reason. While Hall infiltrates Ambrose in Sydney (oh, this movie takes place in Australia for some reason), Hunt and his team (an excellent Ving Rhames and an unbearable John Polson, who in three seconds creates the most excruciating Australian stereotype ever put to film) set up in the outback. WHY ON EARTH ARE THEY IN THE OUTBACK? There\\'s nowhere in ALL OF SYDNEY that they can set up? The Australian slang is excruciatingly manufactured coming from the actors, even from native Australian Polson.Its cut together with typical John Woo action - two guns, flying pigeons, endless slow-mo sequences, and an explosion is always warranted. Seriously, there are points where explosions and slow-mo is incorporated where I think \"why are you doing this, Woo, why?\" Two motorbikes collide in midair and explode for some reason, instead of just scuffing each other and falling heavily to the ground. Meanwhile, Hunt (who misses a big \"impossible mission\" sequence in this movie) has one scene where he must destroy the Chimera virus, and despite Rhames shouting helplessly that he must hurry, Woo decided to shoot Cruise in slow-motion. Its excruciating to watch.Mission Impossible 2 is an action soap opera. The music, overacting, and even the way people move around the room and discuss betrayals. Its fun and harmless if you turn your brain off, but focusing you will see its a giant blob of stuff that Woo should never have been allowed to make under the Mission Impossible banner. He should never be allowed to work with Thandie Newton again, that\\'s for sure.\"', '\"Overall this wasn\\'t that bad a movie, but there were just too many times I groaned or unintentionally laughed at something going on.  It\\'s about as good as the first one, even though it\\'s not very similar to it.  Dougray Scott tried too hard to be evil, and the script gave him some bad lines.  I love seeing Anthony Hopkins in anything, but his screen time totaled probably five minutes.  Ving Rhames had a lot less to do this time around than he did in the first one.\"', '\"SUM OF ALL FEARS  ***+  Drama/Action  Novel by Tom Clancy Ben Afflek, Morgan Freeman James Cromwell The CIA attempts to locate a Nuclear bomb before it can be detonated on US soil. The film is extremely well put together. I especially like the degree of background detail and insight into human behavior it contains. While there are some plot flaws, overall the film is believeable, very exciting, and intense. Highly recommended.\"', '\"I read somewhere that this film features \"megawatt movie star power.\" That may be true, but no one in the film seemed to get a big head--that is, no one outshined anyone else. With this movie pushing the best that Hollywood has to offer, it\\'s refreshing to realize that they\\'re all ordinary people just like you and me that just like to have fun, and that\\'s exactly what they\\'ve created--a fun movie.I have to say that I am not the biggest fan of Steven Soderbergh (I thought that Traffic was depressing), but this was a movie that I liked more and more the longer I sat in the theater.The plot is surprisingly engaging, full of a number of nifty loops and minute details that you have to watch carefully to follow through. Again the acting was all great; the casting I definitely couldn\\'t complain about. My only gripe is that, because there are so many characters, it\\'s difficult to get to \"know\" them as much as one would like. Aside from that it\\'s a great film, intended solely to entertain, not to push across some profound meaning.\"', '\"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and am surprised by all the negative criticism. It\\'s terrifically entertaining as are all the earlier Bonds. As for invisible cars, didn\\'t I read recently that a \"cloak of invisibility\" has been demo\\'d at some university in the US? So perhaps the movie makers were on to something here that we have had to wait a while to hear more of? I can\\'t believe for a moment that it won\\'t be possible to \"conceal\" objects in the future. There are stranger things that actually happen. But, in case it never proves possible, what\\'s wrong with a bit of fantasy and a few laughs - laughing is good for us according to the scientists (little enough of laughs in CR2006, after all, another reason I hated it).Brosnan as always gives a sterling performance. I\\'m a great fan of all the Bond actors except the latest, Craig, who is a humourless mediocrity pretending to be Bond and for me has (helped along by all the other incompetence in CR2006) completely wrecked Bond. I can\\'t imagine why Brosnan was rejected in place of a musclebound unknown with no charisma whatsoever. But Brosnan like the earlier Bonds has great Star Quality and Bond is a Star character needing a Star actor.Reality isn\\'t an absolute necessity in Bond, so long as we can connect with the things that happen and it isn\\'t too far into fantasy. Bond tortured - this movie did it right. Compare with the laughable sequence in CR2006. Brosnan knows how to act torture. The sequences in Iceland are beautiful and in the final dramatic scene stunning. Someone complained of CGI but do we really expect the producers to have to make this particular sequence for real...it\\'s unthinkable. So what\\'s the alternative to CGI? I don\\'t suggest CGI should be used to replace reality in Bond movies unless the reality is just too dangerous or too difficult. And CGI is here to stay whether you like it or not.I liked the villains - clever twists and well-acted menace. Fantastic scenes in Iceland particularly. The Threat to Mankind......? Spoiler follows...Spoiler: I heard complaints that a finely targeted laser wouldn\\'t be very dangerous but the movie itself demonstrates otherwise, surely. There are two opposing possibilities - Icarus, or some crude weapon that couldn\\'t be targeted so causes huge blanket damage. I think the laser would be extremely useful as it can target individual buildings for example. A Star Wars weapon, surely. This movie offered this option giving us the chance to see what such a weapon can do or not do. Other Bonds can offer other options.\"', '\"I loved this movie!!! I have seen it 5 times in theater already. This movie has a great cast and a great plot. The whole movie just worked really well. The characters are so intelligent that the ending amazes you. I definitely request this movie to whoever is looking for comedy and a wonderful cast. My rating- Definitely a 10!!!\"', '\"I must say, I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie. I wasn\\'t expecting much because this movie got worse reviews than the snooze-fest that was the original. However, this movie managed to keep my attention a lot more than the original and had a lot more action.People have criticized that the plot is more like James Bond than Mission Impossible. They\\'re probably right, but at least the story is easy to follow in this one. I thought the twists with people wearing masks were actually pretty clever.Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt and once again proves that he can carry an action blockbuster with no problem. Thandie Newton is eye candy and plays a real role in the story. The main villain of the film, Sean Ambrose, played by Dougray Scott, makes this a love triangle. Ambrose is a decent if not great villain.This movie has quite a lot of action. The motorcycle chase and subsequent hand-to-hand combat between Hunt and Ambrose at the end will give you the bang for your buck. There is also an exciting gun sequence at Ambrose\\'s laboratory.They scenery in Australia is really lovely and I liked the update of the M:I theme song. I don\\'t like that Anthony Hopkins only had a minor role, though.After the dull first installment, this movie was a breath of fresh air. The action and romance between the leads makes this a great summer blockbuster. It\\'s not art, but it sure is fun.RATING: B+\"', '\"I must admit that I wasn\\'t too excited about Charlie\\'s Angels when I saw the first couple of trailers, but to my delighted surprise I truly enjoyed the film. Cameron, Drew, and Lucy all pulled their own weight and kept the campy flirtatiousness that the film needed to resemble the series. Bill Murray was a little flat but still managed to keep me laughing and I was never bored when he was on screen. The effects were the highlight of the film obviously borrowing from The Matrix but fitting in better than those types of effects have in other recent films.  We\\'re not supposed to be believing what\\'s happening on the screen anyway so the fact that these people are doing these stunts is just more exciting.  Kind of like watching a really intense cartoon.I think special notice needs to go to both Sam Rockwell (for a great and versatile performance) and to Crispin Glover (whom I didn\\'t recognize until the credits at the end. Over all the movie kept it\\'s intensity and it direction throughout, never missing a beat or a laugh.  A surprise and a welcome one after a rather dismal year at the movies.\"', '\"There are genres you can classify a movie into. There\\'s action, adventure, sci-fi, thriller, suspense, comedy, romance, rom-com, mystery, family, etc. And a movie is classified into one or three genres because they clearly and cleverly exhibit the characteristic of such genre. An action movie is something that focuses on a conflict that results to a clash of physical forces. An adventure is one that focuses on encounters with another world. A sci-fi is a movie that deals with scientifically-based conflicts. And so forth (I am not discussing types of movie genre but I just needed to refer back to these references later for the sake of argument).With all that said, I have to say that I cannot seem to identify which genre this movie belongs to. Action, it could be... but there is too much exaggeration in all of the fight scenes and nothing seemed realistic. Every action movie has at least one realistic fight but this movie has none. I am personally practicing a form of defense fighting and it totally annoys me to see a lot of non-sense forms of fighting used in this movie. They are not even effective in real fights! This may lead one to speculate that this movie can be classified as fantasy because of all the not-so-realistic action scenes. However, this can\\'t be fantasy because the setting is in our real world and that is the irony because nothing is even realistic in this movie. Sci-fi, I don\\'t think so because some events even violated the laws of science (eg: too much flying, flipping, all those unbelievable stunts). Adventure, definitely not because there is nothing adventurous in all the characters\\' encounter.Another flaw of this movie is the main characters. Their behaviors made me believe that those ladies are acting smart and intellectual when actually they are dumb. There is also too much posing and unnecessary acts that even silly people don\\'t do. There was never an intelligent conversation in this movie.Bottom line, if you are a serious movie goer, don\\'t take this movie seriously or you\\'ll end up very frustrated you\\'ll want to tear this movie. Don\\'t even watch it if your intent is to feel good. This is not a feel-good movie. Watch it if and only if you want to get silly.\"', '\"I\\'ll make this short. If the movie was what the last 25 minutes are, it would be perfect (in a weird way). But sadly, it is not.I think that the main problem of MI2 is that it take itself too serious, like, two guys jump from their bikes and collide with each other IN THE F# AIR, but you also are supposed to be worried about a global virus that will destroy the world. And you just don\\'t buy it.But there are also a lot of shitty things here, the romance between Ethan and Nyah happened so fast, the guy is literally risking his life for her, after one night (or less).The soundtrack is sometimes a real mess, you go to some mexican type of music in some scenes (with no-sense at all) to some heavy metal type of music in another one. And it just don\\'t fit for the majority of the time.And, ok, we have to talk about the slow-mo, look, Matrix is fantastic, amazing, but the bunch of crap that came after it is surreal. It seems like the director just saw Matrix and thought \"we have to put more slow-mo in the movie! It will be great!\". But, well... no. A lot of scenes you can notice that they were clearly shoot with normal cameras, and slowled in pos.Tom Cruise is amazing in the film when the subject is action scenes. The guy let they hold a KNIFE above his eyes! The dude is a monster, really. He\\'s stunt\\'s are by far the best thing in the whole movie.Well, in short, Mission: Impossible II it\\'s really not a great film (in fact, it\\'s bad), but the last 30 minutes of it are very watchable (you can search for it on YT if you really want to see), the rest of it is almost everything just boring, way over the top, but yet, very serious about it\\'s crazy plot.\"', '\"I like blaxploitation films like The Mack or Coffy and I\\'m glad that someone decided to remake (sequel) this film, though I\\'ve never get a chance to watch an original Shaft. I\\'ve noticed that they were trying to keep a spirit of 70\\'s by making this film and I think they succeeded at this point. The movie was pretty good but still something there was missing. I liked how Christian Bale played that racist guy (pretty similar role with the one he had in American Psycho) and I also liked how Samuel L. Jackson played Shaft. The story was also interesting but I thing it was too simple for a feature film. There wasn\\'t many action sequences and those who were wasn\\'t very impressive. But anyways, the movie had it\\'s own highlights only there was too little of them.\"', '\"Upon first reading the title, viewers would get the first impression that this film involves just racing cars. In a sense, it does but in a different way than your standard track race of 99 laps. It involves much more than that and to demonstrate this, a cast of actors were chosen for this franchise that have taken the genre of driving cars to the next level. This is the movie that brought several no name actors to the spotlight. The most obvious is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. And what almost seemed like would be a strange mashup of racing and detective work, turned out to be a fairly solid film.Paul Walker plays Brian O\\'Conner, an undercover cop who is trying to help the FBI capture a group of road bandits who end up plundering innocent truck drivers traveling down highways. To do this, he digs deep into the underworld of street racing where racers of different backgrounds and revved up cars come together for a common cause. The thrill of the ride and all the benefits that come with it; sex, drugs, respect and money. As he slowly assimilates with his surroundings, he befriends a man named Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family members. There he begins to investigate who is behind the truck jackings.This is actually not a bad plot at all. The writing does have its weak points, which will be touched upon but let\\'s start with the positive. I enjoyed how O\\'Conner has to come to grips with himself and who he\\'s going to support. This shows that he\\'s a human being and has a conscious. The same goes for Dominic Toretto, in a different way though. Toretto must come to grips with himself knowing he wasn\\'t the person he once was. Both characters are from very different worlds yet they share a struggle that resembles each other. That struggle is being human and knowing who you are as a person. Sure it\\'s not believable in every aspect but at least it lets the audience know that these characters do have a mind of their own.The weak part to the film is the final scene. All there is to say is that it is too abrupt. It completely detours from what the plot was centered on, along with leaving a few subplots open for interpretation. But was it needed - no. It would be nice to see some closure on more than one subplot. Surely if this franchise didn\\'t earn a sequel then where would the conclusion to this story be? Hard to say. But if there\\'s one thing that helps make up for that are the racing sequences to this movie. Even if you\\'re not a racing fan, the action scenes should entertain. I mean, who doesn\\'t want to (or enjoys already) driving over the speed limit for fun? Driving at high speeds gets the adrenaline pumping and makes every action much more intense. So if you don\\'t enjoy that kind of thing, this movie isn\\'t for you.The editing by Peter Honess who also did The Shadow (1994), L.A. Confidential (1997) and Highlander (1986) did a good job here as well. The shots are well connected and will keep the attention of the audience quite easily. The score produced by BT isn\\'t anything to praise over though. Some action scenes didn\\'t even contain music, which was odd because you\\'d think one would want to make that scene more intense by adding music. And although he doesn\\'t create a theme for the franchise, his music does match the tone and attitude of the film. And for this kind of film, as long as it maintains that, that\\'s all that matters. Because there is also contemporary music inserted in various scenes, BT\\'s music transitions well into the contemporary music. It\\'s good.It lacks logic in a few areas and has a loose ending but the car scenes and actors help them overcome that. Plus it has some unexpected character development that helps give the main characters a good amount of charm.\"', '\"This is a good action movie, and Samuel Jackson is pretty good in it. However, I only give it 7 1/2 out of 10 because of Jeffrey Wright\\'s character (Peoples Hernandez). He is the only person that really stands out in the movie. Otherwise the movie probably deserves 6 1/2 out of 10. Good summer movie, though. Doesn\\'t require you to think too much.\"', '\"Shaft (2000) By Dean KishThe greatest blaxpolitation hero returns with a new face and that same old attitude and style for a whole new generation. The title of the film `Shaft\\' refers to the title character John Shaft (now played by Samuel L Jackson) who in the early seventies captivated audiences with his cool attitude, no nonsense style and brutal approach to law enforcement. In this latest film, Shaft tries to bring down a white supremacist (Christian Bale) who has brutally clubbed a black guy to death. The key to the case lies with a cocktail waitress (Toni Collette)who witnessed the murder.  If Shaft can track her down and keep her alive long enough he may finally bring the bad guy down. The only thing standing is his way is a vindictive drug dealer (Jeffrey Wright) hired by the supremacist to kill the witness. All the brilliance of the original `Shaft\\' is here except its been streamlined and evolved into a great looking action film. The film has great performances from Samuel L Jackson, Jeffrey Wright and Christian Bale.Jackson is perfectly cast as the attitude filled Shaft. One small problem I had with his casting was some of his scenes reminded me of the character he played in `Pulp Fiction\\'. Bale is amazing as the brutal bad guy who finds he there are worse evils than he can deliver. This is Bale\\'s second key role as a devilish villain in a row. I think he has the potential to travel the route James Woods has taken with his career. Boy, has he changed since `Newsies\\'. Anyone remember that film? Finally I was really impressed with relative new-comer Jeffrey Wright who plays the perfect druglord scumbag. He made his motion picture debut 10 years ago with `Presumed Innocent\\' but has since made a name for himself on Broadway where he was awarded a Tony award in 1994 for the 7 hour play, `Angels in America Â– Perestroika\\' . Wright was so believable that I had to see him on the Tonight Show before I could get that character out of my head. The way the film is put together and synchronized is really nice to see. This is the pure atmosphere that makes us fondly remember those cult films of seventies. I have always loved the Isaac Hayes `Shaft\\' theme song. Another atmospheric marvel within Shaft is that this film plays homage to genre by embracing what it was instead of making fun of it. Another breath of fresh air had to be there was no cliched woman love interest for the hero. Blaxpolitation is finally becoming cool. I really only had a couple problems with Shaft. One being the excessive amount of bad language but that is just a warning to the people who may be sensitive to that nature. Another was I felt was the miss use of the female leads. Williams and even Collette seemed to be dumbed down and fade into the background. I feel sorry for them and wished they were given a little more depth. Pose this question: What would happen if Shaft met a 90\\'s woman? I welcome the return to the 70s Shaft brings to me. I love his no holds barred approach. Wonder if we\\'ll see a sequel? (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.\"', '\"This movie literally slapped me in the face when I first saw it. The trailer had me very excited but when I saw it, I was glad my sister talked me out of going to see it in cinema, would have been a waste of my 20 dollars. What were they thinking by making Tom Cruise do some really lame a** fight sequences? Were they trying to make him look bad?! I think they succeeded. Several times, they showed him doing some really dumb and absurd moves!!! It annoyed me when I saw it, I just fast-forwarded!!Then there\\'s Tom and Thandie (Ethan and Nyah). They were like a...\"confused\". She particularly annoyed me with her stupid one-liners.One minute, they sleep together, then they are disagreeing! How annoying!! Then there\\'s the villain, Dougray Scott (Sean Ambrose) who seem to know when and where Tom Cruise would be each time. Come on, John Woo, what is that?!! And what\\'s with the wide angle camera shot at the beginning?!! Too cliche! Every action movie has that!!! And the most confusing thing about this movie, up to this day that I will never understand, is the scene where Tom and Thandie are driving and their cars start to spin parallel to each others. What..How..Who..When..?!!!! Huh?!!!! And Sean knew what Nyah was up to from the start! Come on, John Woo or whoever wrote this crappy script!! No!! And don\\'t even get me started on the use of the face masks!! How is it that Ethan Hunt knew to carry a mask of Hugh (Richard Roxburgh) when he went to the place where they were exchanging the virus for the money?!!!! That is way too smart!!! John Woo should take a hint from the director of the \"Die Hard\" franchise. Now that is pure blooded action!! John Woo has failed in his attempt to deliver another masterpiece like \"Face Off\". May his English was so bad that Tom Cruise and the others decided \"what the hey, I can\\'t understand him so I\\'ll just do my own thing\" This movie should have been rated PG! The violence, my nephew was laughing at how stupid it was!!! There was no intense violence. Even a 2 year old child would pelt popcorn at the TV when this is going on because they think it is stupid!! The first movie was sooo much better than this pack of bulls***!! People only wasted their good money to see this movie because Tom Cruise was in it. I hope that the 3rd part is going to really bring back the real MI. Has the world gone mad when they were making this film?!! I would love to know who wrote this s***!! It really annoyed me! Tom Cruise, you disappointed me! That was not you! You can do much better. To movie lovers out there, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET A LAUGH BECAUSE IT IS MORE LIKE A COMEDY THAN ACTION (THE ACTION SEQUENCES WILL HAVE YOU LAUGHING IN ANNOYANCE OF THIS STUPID FILM). Rating-0.00001/10. That is how awful it was!!!\"', '\"Bad Boys II doesn\\'t reinvent the wheel, it just makes it bigger, faster, and more attractive. The film is little more than a collection of high intensity action scenes with a tons of irreverent humor and mild characterization tossed in between. It\\'s slick, high energy fun and a huge success for what it is and wants to be, which is, essentially, the quintessential Michael Bay experience.\"', '\"Halle Berry is the most unattractive Bond girl ever. Nicole Kidman really deserved the Oscar that went to Berry; Kidman is a better actress, she is more intelligent and more beautiful - and she would clearly be a much better Bond girl!We already had emancipated Bond girls that were equal to Bond (i.e., female spies) in earlier movies such as The Spy Who Loved Me or Moonraker. But these Bond girls were very beautiful and these two movies were simply marvellous (outstanding like classic MGM musicals or Hitchcock thrillers with Cary Grant). Today, Bond is just another action movie.Brosnan is humdrum and brainless as usual, but so was Connery when he played Bond. I agree with Desmond Llewlyn, the legendary Q who worked with all five Bond actors. He said that Roger Moore was the best. That\\'s true!\"', '\"Not going to go into the plot. It\\'s a good all round entertainment film, with interest, excitement and plot. Stars abound, they all do their bit and make the whole experience more enjoyable.*** Spoilers ***I have only two criticisms. The little love story within takes us away from the rest of the story. Perhaps it adds a touch of \"Got ya!\" to the bad guy, but is he a bad guy? Not really. A businessman with a focused personality perhaps.The other one is that burning question...How do they get the money out of Vegas? This isn\\'t explored, but left to the imagination. I have a feeling they script writers couldn\\'t think up a way of doing it without falling over their highly technological script. More than once the issue is raised about being stuck in the middle of the desert, and no solution is forthcoming. Perhaps Ocean\\'s Eleven II is yet to come out with \"Did Danny\\'s followers at the end of the film do anything?\" or \"Here\\'s how they got the cash out of Vegas\".\\nAll that said, it\\'s one of the first films I\\'ve watched in a long time which had very little violence, swearing, nudity, sex or the abuse of drugs or alcohol. Not that I care one way another if the film is good, but it\\'s extremely refreshing to think that Hollywood can produce a hit with the above qualities.Even Julia Roberts doesn\\'t quite get a chance to cry!All in all a great film. I gave it 9/10, taking into account the plot failings above. I highly recommend it to all the family.\"', '\"Horrible movie! Why is that everything coming out of Hollyweird has two major problems? One, the women are made to act like men. They dress more shabbily than the male characters, they have more physical strength than the male characters, they have more scientific aptitude than the male characters, they display more willpower than the male characters. The public seems to feed off this perverted view of modern women. Two, the plot in these movies is a joke. What\\'s so difficult about making a normal movie that takes some brains to follow? All these films have explosions, more explosions, and then some more explosions. The style of filming is also becoming darker, more syncopated, especially the fight scenes. Ditch these garbage films NOW!!\"', '\"This was one of the most disappointing movies I have seen for several years. After the first Mission Impossible, I have wanted to buy the sequel. We watched it last night and have already put it on a garage sale pile.I think the casting was adequate although I was hoping to see some continuity from the first movie (more than 2 characters) and possibly some recognizable star names. The plot concept was decent as well although it was rehashed via dialogue throughout the movie. These were not my issues with the movie.I had trouble following some aspects of the movie (holes) while other scenes dragged on and on. There were also intended surprises/shockers throughout the movie. However, they were so blatantly advertised that an 8-year old would see them coming. The musical score was practically a neon sign advertising them as well. They were also were used so many times that the movie looked like a one-trick pony.One other issue - martial arts. I love a good fight flick as much as anybody. However, I expect a MI movie to be more like a James Bond with secrecy and gadgets rather than like a Van Damme show.Bummer!\"', '\"Die Another Day will not disappoint.  It provides excellent action scenes and the prerequisite explosions for any big budget popcorn movie.  Pierce Brosnan does a fine job in the movie, although it looks like he has never picked up a sword or a cigar in his life.Halle Berry does fine work in the movie portraying Jinx, the American NSA agent.  One interesting part of the film absent in previous films is a bit of strife between American and British forces.  They have similar goals, but their agents and administrators clash a bit during the film.I have an affinity for the \"real\" Bond movies (read: w/ Connery) but I really enjoyed this one.  You go in expecting Bond, not fine cinema, and you leave satisfied.Negatives of the movie include a HORRIBLE title song by Madonna and equally retched cameo.  The score is excellent, and features a Clash song prominently.  The plot is a bit transparent and gets a bit fantastical, almost cartoonish in the last 30 minutes.There are references to other Bond movies in the film (Halle\\'s Ursula Andress swimsuit and a Diamond ad that says \"diamonds are forever\") that should amuse the Bond-nerds like myself.The sexual innuendos, always a staple of Bond films, were predictable and not very clever.  Also, the CGI seemed a bit over the top at times- the \"iceberg surfing\" scene comes to mind.  Icarus seems to have the power to ravage icebergs and sold ground but it takes minutes to melt an ice house and only damages the Villain\\'s plane.Go see this one expecting an above-average movie in the Bond series and you wont be disappointed.  Let the bad parts, when they come, roll of your back and you wont be too distracted.The plot is clearly defined in this one, and I am very happy to see the resurgence of Communist Villains.See it in the theatres or on DVD.  THere isnt much else out this holiday that pleases.7/10\"', '\"Sure, Affleck and Jlo are a bit tedious.  But don\\'t slag their movies because of it.  This is a good and almost great political thriller, which was almost believable.  The editing was a bit wonky at times, but overall, it kept me riveted.Good flick and I recommend it.\"', '\"This is a T&A action movie. The opening sequence blistered on to the screen with a convoluted Bond-like opening (I swear I heard tributes to Bond and Mission Impossible in the musical score). The action was intense all the way up to the first dialogue. I began to hope that the dialogue wouldn\\'t spoil the movie. For the most part the dialogue added to this tasty bit of cheese.\\nThere were several scenes that were laugh getters, and the Cameron Diaz scene on Soul Train worked for me. There were a few low spots, but not enough to ruin it for me. First off, when you see this movie throw reality out the window. It is a comic book with comic book characters.As a piece of great cinema, this won\\'t compare. But as a fun-filled, care-free piece of cheese that will get you out of yourself for a little while, this is definitely worthwhile.However, if you do not or can not enjoy cheese, this movie is not for you (RE).\"', '\"I loved the first MIB.  It was cool, funny and had a plot I could care about.  So when I heard that MIBII was coming out, I was excited.  Now I wish I had stayed home and watched the original on DVD again.  This second time around just isn\\'t that interesting.  Since the whole plot can be seen from the preview, I\\'ll list my likes and dislikes.  Dislikes:(1)the huge amount of product placements. There hasn\\'t been a movie with this many commercials since \"Days of Thunder.\"  As if aliens would land on Earth and start eating at a Burger King and need a Sprint cell phone.  (2)The cameo of Michael Jackson.  Scary! (3)Having Zed fight \"Matrix\" style doesn\\'t fit. (4) The dog singing \"Who Let the Dogs Out.\" (5)Will Smith saying \"Talk to the hand.\"  (6) This is some of Rick Baker\\'s worst work.  It\\'s like he went through his workshop and found rejects from other movies.  (7) Lara Flynn Boyle is just horrible and Johnny Knoxville is wasted.  Where did he go at the end of the movie?  (8)Will Smith just walks through this.  It looks like he was worn out from \"Ali.\" Likes (1)Tommy Lee Jones is still cool.  (2)Biz Markie cameo (3)The locker creatures. Hopefully for MIBIII, they watch the cartoon series (GREAT) and get some plot ideas.  Bring back Linda Fiorentino and find the fun that made the first one so good.\"', '\"At least Madonna can\\'t be blamed for this movie being bad.  The special effects are awful (hello Star-Wars-Blue-Screen-Cheapskate!) and the action is anything but.  I also grew tired of the constant product placement.  I\\'m not a Bond fan, so I can\\'t compare it to others in the series.  You\\'d have to be a fan of the series to enjoy this one.  John Cleese is funny as always, but his talent is wasted, and Madonna\\'s DAD song kicks ass.\"', '\"I loved MIB...  With that said I have to say that MIB II was not a very good movie.  Too short, no real chemistry between the actors, ok special effects but nothing spectacular, boring epilogue, very few laughs and generally just barely worth watching.  The best thing about this movie was the talking dog, which is a problem, as he was not the star.This movie just felt like the producers had said, \"we made oh-so-much money on the first one, let\\'s throw together another and make a bundle more.\"  And what the heck, I spent my money to go and so will millions of others.  The biggest disappointment was that Smith and Jones were way too serious, with few laugh lines.  I wanted so badly to be entertained, but it didn\\'t do it.I guess I will have to wait for MIB III...\"', '\"Not a really good movie, the actors were awfall plus a rubbish story line.

The basic story line is of diamnods are for ever (ofcourse with better graphics).Then, it looks more like a Rambo/John Woo action movie then a bond film. The action sometimes goes overboard even for a bond movie.Halle Berry looks HOT, but with all due respect doesnt suit in a bond movie. She looks very tough to be a bond girl. I may sound a male chauvinist here but I would really expect a bond girl persona more like Rosamund Pike then Halle Berry. And no, she doesnt look as hot as ursula andrews, in Dr. No.Good parts in the movie are *SOME* good one liners, especially from the bad guys, a good start of movie, and pierce brosnan.

I didn\\'t care that \"Rumble in the Bronx\" had no plot, or that Arnold Schwartenegger can\\'t act. If stuff blows up, I\\'m happy. And I\\'m not sophisticated enough to appreciate dramas. But -- I do appreciate an intelligent plot or characterization that does something original, makes me think, and when stuff blows up there had better be some good tension and great action.\"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" is a straightforward heist flick without much of the above. It\\'s not exactly bad (like \"The Score\" which I found offensively boring compared to its promos), but just uninspiring. The all-star cast does nothing to lift this impression.Who should see this film:-- action buffs who have nothing better to do on a rainy day,and haven\\'t formed false expectations from the all-star billing-- I can\\'t think of anyone else. Arty types definitely stay away.he film is not a comedy, and unless you\\'ve got quite a seriouscrush on one of the stars, I would not go just to see them.I\\'ll give Ocean\\'s Eleven a respectable but not eye-opening 6 out of 10.\"', '\"For those of us who really enjoy movies, most of you have heard of Mission Impossible 2. Besides X-Men this is the most hyped movie of the year. I myself being a big fan of the first film I was very excited for the second. Having seen the first trailer back in 1999 M.I2 became no. 2 movie to see (After Gladiator). Unfortunately it was a bit of a letdown.In short the plot concerns Tom Cruise\\'s cool guy Ethan Hunt from the first M.I flick recovering a stolen virus that kills people very quickly. This virus is stolen by rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose.This is an interesting idea and since its very much a supervirus only Ethan Hunt can recover it.The problem with this film is that everything in this film is under developed. In the first film Ethan wasn\\'t a super-hero but, for some reason in this film he is. Luther from the first film is back except he just sits behind a computer. Sean Ambrose is a great villan but is denied enough screen time to develop. The best point of this movie is the relationship between Anthony Hopkins and Tom Cruise. Their is a certain amount of not trusting each other one can feel, but once again it\\'s under developed. The other thing that bothered me is that Ethan took no time to figure out the villan\\'s plan contrary to the first film where it took him the whole movie to figure things out.The good points of this movie is that as normal Tom Cruise is dead on in his performance as is Dougray Scott. The action is great but contrary to what most people are expecting this movie has only 2 big action moments (Both of which rock :). This is a spy movie which is good and keeps this film from becoming a generic boring action flick.I have to say that so far so good for the Mission Impossible series. Keep things up and it could be bigger than Bond.***Â½ out of *****\"', '\"The stunts in the movie were cool. The car driving scenes and races were interesting.\\nAnd Vin Diesel is a good actor\"', '\"The Sum of All Fears, starring Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman, breathes new life into the franchise of movies begun by Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford. The world was introduced to Tom Clancy\\'s Jack Ryan in 1990\\'s The Hunt for Red October and the follow ups Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. The Sum of All Fears examines how Jack Ryan, Ben Affleck, began his journey in the CIA to become one of the most powerful men in the world; in Tom Clancy\\'s universe, of course. Affleck plays the wet-behind-the-ears rookie, Ryan, a young CIA analyst from the Russian desk whose job seems to involve keeping tabs on the diplomacy of ailing Russian President and the rampant sex lives of Russian politicians.  Jack Ryan is thrust into a position of the informant to the President once the pyramid of power in Russia has toppled, allowing the ascension Alexander Nemerov.  Ryan is brought in as the authority on the new and seemingly volatile Russia President, played by CiarÃ¡n Hinds, as long as those in power listen to what he has to say..Affleck does not act alone here; he has an incredible troupe of supporting actors, if they can be called just that. The young analyst is taken almost immediately under protective wing by CIA Director, Bill Cabot played Morgan Freeman. Not atypically, Freeman picks up the mentor role for which he has become famous for yet manages to inject a different kind of flare. Freeman isn\\'t grasping at straws here; he\\'s confident in the knowledge that he has and in his established role as the President\\'s adviser. It\\'s Ryan that has the come to grips with what he knows and the inability of the leaders of America to use what he knows to their benefit. Yet, thankfully, The Sum of All Fears doesn\\'t degenerate into a simple film about a CIA guru rising above everything to save the day. Well, it is that, but its also so much more.This film is obviously about the depths to which terrorists will go to see the mighty powers of the world destroy each other and the attempt, by seemingly one man, the clear the cloud of deception. But The Sum of All Fears resounds in its ability to combine the chaos of diplomacy and the real men who could order the end of the world, as we know it. The incomparable James Cromwell as President Fowler is, as always, fantastic. He brings such evocative emotion and reality to the greatest fears of not only Americans, but also all people. Aboard Air Force One, after the nuclear explosion that rocks most of Baltimore, Fowler argues with Defense Secretary Becker (Phillip Baker Hall), National Security Advisor Revel (Bruce McGill), and Secretary of State Owens (Ron Rifkin) in gut-wrenchingly honest and intense display of emotions.The only glaring errors in The Sum of All Fears are the inconsistencies when comparing the film to the previous films based on Jack Ryan; such as taking place in the present instead of following a more realistic timeline considering and comparing Ryan\\'s age. But this is nit picking, and there\\'s no need for it. Fans and non-fans alike (of Clancy\\'s books or movies) are given a world in which they can explore on any level. However, Clancy-readers will rejoice to find John Clark played perfectly by Liev Schreiber. The occasional glimpse that the audience is given of the most intense character Clancy ever created is exciting.As for the villains of the film, Alan Bates as Richard Dressler is perfectly chilling, once labeling Germany as unable to handle the power that Nazism gave to it and Hitler simply stupid, not insane. That Neo-nazi Fascists have replaced the intended Arabian terrorists from Clancy\\'s original work comes across as fresh and conceivable, not like some pathetic attempt to try and gloss over Sept. 11and the nationalities of those true terrorists. And of course, the nuclear explosion is haunting and breathtaking at once. The implications of its impact that director Phil Robinson gives us only hints of, is perfectly terrifying, never taking the clichÃ© route of overexposing the audience to the horror of the fission bomb.To be honest, it\\'s the relationships that make The Sum of All Fears work so well. The exploration of the strained relationship between Ryan and Cathy Muller (Bridget Moynahan) is effective in its simplicity and subtly. The development feels natural and the strain on the relationship because of Ryan\\'s increased responsibilities, unbeknownst to Muller, fits perfectly. But this love affair thankfully takes up a comfortable position on the back seat as the major players come toÂ…well, play. Hinds\\' Nemerov is electrifying and played to perfection as a ruler whose power is used in the attempt to destroy him. Both the power and vulnerability of this character is tangible, which can be said of Fowler as well. And Ryan (Affleck) is the perfect foil to them both. If only he can get them to listen.The Sum of All Fears is, by far, one of the better movies that has come out this year. By no means are we to forget its supposed to be a blockbuster, but thankfully it\\'s a little more than that. A little more intelligent, funny, and a hell of a lot better acted than most. And damnÂ…its Ben AffleckÂ…and he\\'s good!\"', '\"The movie starts off with a campy title sequence that spoofs the original TV series title sequence- at that point, one knows not to take this movie seriously.

This movie gave me a headache it was so bad.  First off it seemed like it was one big advertisement, they changed the MiB head quarters into an airport full of burger kings and Sprint stations.  And the playstation controller as the steering wheel to the car... that just made me sick.  Now I loved the first movie, and knew that this wouldn\\'t live up to the name and would probably be bad.  But I at least thought it would be entertaining... nope.  And the fight scenes looked like they were made just so they could make a video game, and no that\\'s not a good thing.  Wasn\\'t even fun to make fun of with my friends.  Now they very well could make a third movie, and I wouldn\\'t be surprised at all if they started talks about it since this movie will make a lot of money.  If they do, then I hope they decide in the third one to take out all advertisements, add character development, make a decent story, and don\\'t jump into things right then waiting halfway through the movie until anything changes.  If you feel like giving yourself a headache, or feel like getting angry at something, then go see this movie\"', '\"I am a huge Bond fan. I have seen every single James Bond movie from Dr. No, till this most recent flick, Die Another Day. This movie starts out fine with great gadgets, awsome action sequences and an already thickening plot. Up till that point, I was psyched. What the James Bond films are losing more and more, is James Bond. So far before the opening credits, I am supposed to be thrilled, but then again I may as well be watching XXX with Vin Diesel. After the opening credits (which have a twist in this film), I am supposed to meet Bond, and we are about to get down to business . . . wrong. More action and violence. In fact one never meets James Bond till a half hour into the film, when he stumbles into a Hotel. I will admit that there is a good amount of Bond instead of XXX type action, but there is not much inbetween. One minute Mr. Suave, and then the next Rambo.Another complaint is the completely farfetched action sequences. For god sakes, there is something called reality. I see way too much of world-class XXX stunts, that is completely impossible, that is not what James Bond is all about. One or Two of those per movie please. This movie had hundreds. It makes you start to question why James Bond hasn\\'t died yet, and you finally want him to screw up and just not open the parachute in time (or something). Bond is not only losing touch with reality in action sequences, but also logic. John Cleese, shows bond a car that can become invisible (yeah right!) and suddenly a few days later it is in Iceland. I know that this is possible, but it still raises questions when one does not actually see the transport. There are many more that I won\\'t even get into.The problem with this type of action and illogical bumps in the plot, is that it stops you from actually watching and enjoying the film. For the first time ever watching a James Bond movie, I actually stopped enjoying the film because of the STUPID action.Now for my praises. That plot was great. The acting didn\\'t take away from the film, although Halle needs to practice the Heroine roll in films. They gave the film a very nostalgic touch, which meant a bit more to a veteran watcher like me, for they included several gadgets in Cleeses lab from other movies that Bond Jokes about.Summary:Action was so unrealistic that it took away from the film. Dido for illogical plot ripples. James bond is not what he was (I suppose that over 40 years that is bound to happen). Good plot, pretty good acting.\"', '\"Okay ... let me start out by saying that I love John Woo films.  A Better Tomorrow, The Killer, Hard Boiled, Face/Off, were great films.  In my opinion, he is the penultimate action movie director.Now, let me get into MI2.  Except for the action sequences, I thought it was a horrible Hi-I\\'m-Tom-Cruise-watch-me-in-an-action-movie vehicle. Everything in this movie is everything that is NOT Mission Impossible. The original Mission Impossible TV show was suspense-based and most of the time after you watched an episode, you had to think about what just happened. The original MI team also didn\\'t intentionally go head to head with danger, rather they used misdirection and camouflage to get away.  The first MI movie kept most of this premise.But not this movie.  The plot in this movie was weak.  The location was all wrong as well.  I like Australia, but I just don\\'t see it as a location for international intrigue and terrorism.  There was no real MI team; Ving Rhames and the other guy seem to have been added in the movie just to make it look like a team.  Dougray Scott is a good actor, but not good for the role cause he\\'s too much of a pretty boy to take seriously as a villain. They should have used a villainous looking actor like Robert Davi or Sean Bean.  John Woo was wasted on this movie in my opinion, because of the lack of a plot, uninteresting characters, and horrible dialogue are too heavy a burden for the action scenes to hold up.  If Tom Cruise wants to make an American James Bond style movie, he should buy the rights to A Man Called Flint and remake that instead.So if you love John Woo style action, go see this movie.  If you have schoolgirl\\'s crush on Tom Cruise, go see this movie.  If you want to watch a good summer blockbuster movie, go see Gladiator.  I\\'m just glad I paid matinee price to watch this movie.  What a let down!\"', '\"If you\\'ve seen the trailer then you\\'ve seen the whole movie. Don\\'t go to this one hoping for a great story with twists and turns like the first MI. John Woo\\'s slow motion direction style made a slow movie even slower. Someone should inform him that once you use the same special effect twice or more to provide a twist to the movie you shouldn\\'t continue to use it over and over. If people couldn\\'t see what was coming in this one well before it happened then they must have been asleep. One other tip for Mr. Woo, from watching his fight sequences I believe he must play Tekken 3 too much. If anybody has ever played the game you\\'ll know what I mean. I\\'m sure Dougray Scott is kicking himself for passing on the role of Wolverine in the upcoming X-Men movie for the role of such an easily forgotten villain. I guess that\\'s it, I did give it a 5 out of 10 before writing this comment, but as I wrote it I couldn\\'t really think of a reason why I gave it such a high score.\"', '\"Don\\'t get me wrong, years and years ago when I seen the trailer for this...I thought, John woo directing this is awesome; then I saw this movie and from my impression not only I felt really insulted but also cheated at the fact that Mr. Woo added pretty much everything INCLUDING the kitchen sink to explode on impact with merely one bullet and some flashy moves. No disrespect to the director he really is good at his game....when he was doing old school Hong Kong flicks like hard boiled! Mission Impossible 2 (aka Mi: 2) was the long awaited and anticipated sequel to the 1996 sleeper blockbuster and based off the highly successful TV show also with the same name. But in all honestly, this movie didn\\'t raise the bar it just made it worse and nearly almost screwed up this franchise if it wasn\\'t for J.J. Abrams smart approach to the third installment. Tom Cruise returns as the now almost superhuman Ethan hunt who pretty much makes it clear that bullets can\\'t touch him, he can scale mountains with his bare hands, perform flashy martial arts, and have time to woo the girl with his charms damn I\\'m surprise he\\'s not playing the saxophone and surfing the stair rails blindfolded while shooting the bad guys left and right....wait a minute...I think he did do that!! The storyline is weak but simple, You see there\\'s a virus that is capable of wiping out humanity and they gave it a code name: Chimera (oooh Greek roman history lesson somewhere) but in other to fight against this virus a anti-virus was created code name: Balerafont (cause even in viruses there are good verses evil battles!) so of course there\\'s a race against time and they eventually needed someone who can get the job done but unfortunately superman/Ethan was climbing mountains with bare hands and another partner a sexy thief by the name of Nya (Thandie Newton)..oh yeah I forgot his team of Luther and Billy Barty (did I mention that both characters are hardly seen as much in this movie) and who can bring these guys together than Hannibal himself (Anthony Hopkins) which I think the was only there cause they must of paid him a lot but the look on his face said he was pretty much bored in this film but you be the judge on that.Lets face it the story was sub par bad (due to bad and lack of script), the romantic kindling between Tom and Thandie\\'s character was VERY much rushed and obviously typical to the movie goer, and the bad guys were pretty much whinny little babies that can\\'t shoot straight for the life of them but yet Ethan aka. The batman can hide in the shadows make, one shot an explosive one every damn time, can pop wheelies and burn rubber on the side with his feet while riding a motorcycle at very high speeds...did I mention he can cook too!? John Woo\\'s approach wasn\\'t bent on intellect like the first one and third, you can see him trying but it failed in many areas I mean DAMN even Luther (Ving rhames) didn\\'t get that much screen time it was like Woo was saying, \"screw the black man, I want super white guy flashing his pretty hair every chance he gets\" I mean its not like woo hasn\\'t done that before (The big hit and pretty much ALL his Americanized movies). The action scenes were pretty much IMPOSSIBLE I seen tom pretty much risk his ass in ridiculous moments in this movie it made me wonder, \"I wish I can do that!!\" but then was hit with reality and physics. This movie is pretty much a stuntman\\'s dream with the white dove even at the climax I felt really cheated being that I could of sworn I\\'ve seen the dual shootout before (face/off) I could say more to why I didn\\'t like this movie but I\\'m going to watch Mi: 3 on DVD now and be reminded on what could of been done to part 2.\"', '\"I like Cameron Diaz and Drew Barymore but this movie was a big flop. I thought it would have been better than it was. I found it really boring and it was like watching paint dry. I think this has to be their worst movie they have been in.\"', '\"Hollywood knows the formula ... and the formula is boring.This is among the more cookie-cutter big-budget, over-hyped flicks of the last several years ... it is as dull as it was expensive.Two dimensional, insultingly dumb, predictable, derivative, bland, banal ... shall I go on?And it made money ... no wonder Hollywood keeps turning out such mindless drivel.\"', '\"I know the criticism I\\'m about to make is not a deep one, but really: it would have cost them NOTHING to make the medical science more plausible, so why didn\\'t they?  Inaccuracies range from those research would have cleared up (viruses use RNA, not DNA), through those a moment\\'s thought would have cleared up (how can a virus which is fatal in less than two days, and almost impossible to transmit, cause an epidemic?), to those which are just loopy (how can there be a disease which becomes incurable after EXACTLY twenty hours, to the MINUTE, whatever the sex, size, age or initial state of health of the person infected?).Anyway: it\\'s still amazing stuff.  All that heart-stopping rock climbing at the beginning and slow motion photography - PROPER slow-motion photography, which never feels as if it\\'s dragging its heels. At once exhilarating and suspenseful.  My only previous exposure to Woo had been the execrable \"Face/Off\".  It goes without saying that this film is a hundred times better.  (It IS a mystery to me why people were so excited about it in advance: as I said, Woo\\'s previous Hollywood effort had shown no grounds for hope at all, and it\\'s not as if anyone liked the original \"Mission: Impossible\".  I guess it\\'s one of those hype things I\\'ll never understand.) -Sure, the token woman was very hard to take: an unlovable drifter of no fixed abode or accent, and if she was REALLY in love with Ethan Hunt, I renounce any claim to being able to read anyone\\'s state of mind.  And some of the lines ... dear oh dear.  I don\\'t think the gliding, enfolding cinematography EXCUSES these faults, but it\\'s more than enough to make the film worth watching.\"', '\"When watching this film in the theater, not once did I find myself waiting for something exciting to happen because there was always something good going on, even if it wasn\\'t action.  The movie was extremely action packed and had a good storyline.  I think all the cast gave good performances.  I don\\'t care what anyone says about the movie, I thought it was tight.  The story was great, the action was intense, and it kept me interested.  I give it a 10.\"', '\"Charlie\\'s detective agency is hired to recover a piece of electronic equipment to counteract an act of industrial espionage. The three foxy ladies of Charlie\\'s detective agency are on the case getting caught up in a variety of hi-jinx that eventually puts all of them in mortal danger, and even threatens the life of their boss, the demure and debonair Charlie himself.Three little girls went to the police academy, their they were assigned very strenuous activities. However, I took them away from all that. And then, I was bought up by Drew Barrymore\\'s production company to be made into this piece o\\' cr*p! This has to be one of the worst blockbuster\\'s ever made, the women perform a variety of Matrix moves that happen for absolutely no reason apart from the fact that, er, the producers wanted them in there. Cameron Diaz dances in her pants, should be sexy, but comes off as actually quite sad, kind of like a man wearing a Borat style thong, as it seems a bit desperate really, which, for a film which is supposed to be about female empowerment, is just pathetic. Bill Murray clearly wishes he\\'d seen more of the script before signing on the dotted line and ghosts through the movie, although to be fair to his skills, his scenes in this production are one of the only good things in it, his scene in prison and with the sumo suits is great, but he seems to be wishing that someone would find money enough to make \"Royal Tenenbaums\" and \"Lost in Translation\" in order to rescue him from films like this.And for me, this is the biggest travesty of this film, that with a cast that includes Cameron Diaz, Bill Murray, Sam Rockwell (Great in \"Galaxy Quest\" and \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\", here ...Dismal!) and the completely underrated Tim Curry, that such an apocryphal film should be made. Tim Curry is always underused, and both Sam Rockwell and Bill Murray\\'s careers managed to survive this disaster, but in many ways this has had a devastating impact on Cameron Diaz\\'s career. Before this she was arguably one of the most sought after light comedy performers in Hollywood, with a string of good performances from \"The Mask\" through to \"Soemthing about Mary\" with glimpses of more depth with \"The Last Supper\" and \"Being John Malkovich\", however since these dismal outings she has largely become known as that woman that Justin Timberlake went out with and that great potential that she displayed not long ago now seems woefully underused.That this is so high a score on IMDb is a travesty to justice and an indictment to the power of advertising and hype as, like the Policeman said, there really is nothing to see here! PS If my memory is correct Akiva Goldsman was the script doctor on this flick. Nuff said!\"', '\"I had so much fun watching this movie that I went back 9 more times!  I made sure that I took different friends every time and none of them ever complained either.  Three of them were indifferent, but the other six said they honestly got a kick out of it the high energy, special effects, beautiful people and beautiful cars!I loved TFATF because it never pretended to be anything more than what it turned out to be.....  A great action flick with lots of speed and color. No one was pretending this was Shakespeare, but each actor gave his/her performance his/her best shots.  Yes, they are \"callow youths\" and the story was pretty much unbelievable, but hey!!  That is why I go to movies.  I go to suspend belief and be entertained and amused.  When I want to get intellectual and \"think\", I stay home and read a serious book.\\nI loved this lightweight piece of fluff.  It was great fun and I made sure to buy the DVD when it came out so that I can revisit the color, action and speed whenever I please.  God bless Rob Cohen, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and all those beautiful vehicular bullets in The Fast and The Furious!\"', '\"Due to my love of political, complex stories, I was naturally drawn to this film. After seeing the preview, I was hooked. But after finally seeing the film last night, numerous things disappointed me:The best parts of the movie were in the preview! Now I know that in order to get the public to see the film, the preview must be appealing. But one would hope that there are more exciting things in the film BESIDES what\\'s shown in the preview. There are none!Morgan Freeman\\'s character dies! To kill off the best actor in the cast was just horrible. Freeman basically held the movie together when half the audience was on the verge of sleeping during the first 1 hour of this film, due to its REALLY slow start. He was the most entertaining aspect of the film while he was in it. His character dying was VERY disappointing...especially seeing that I saw this film for him!Why didn\\'t the nuclear bomb explode when the Israeli plane was shot down? Then to be found \\'buried\\' in the ground as if the plane crashed instead of the exploded was just illogical. Also, why did it take 30 YEARS for it to be found without ANY inquiries from Israel in that long period of time?Was I the only one who thought that Ryan\\'s girlfriend was the one we saw getting basically BLOWN away by the nuclear blast at the Baltimore hospital?Seeing her still alive really confused me, and the whole thing in the end with Ryan and her at a picnic and everything be happy-go-lucky with them was the EPITOME of cheezy!!Ben Affleck is nothing special in this film. Now this really didn\\'t surprise me, as I\\'m not a fan of Affleck and I basically went to see the film to support Freeman, who\\'s one of my favorite actors. Affleck is in no way convincing in this role. The Sum of All Fears had the potential of being great; with such a good cast (the majority of the actors playing political figures are known to play such roles and don\\'t disappoint) and the subject matter...this could\\'ve been a much better film. But with all of the plot holes, illogical action sequences, and a script full of clichÃ©s...it ultimately doesn\\'t deliver.\"', '\"Well this is a crappy film of course, everything goes wrong here Woo changes his formula, Thandie Newton is ugly and can\\'t act, Ving Rhames and Cruise are bad also and the script sucks. You\\'ve seen the commercial you\\'ve seen the best!!!\\n(just kidding)\\nThis is a good movie, the story is OK, Cruise and Newtons chemistry are good, Rhames is good, the villain is good. The action sequences are good (sometimes brilliant and sometimes OK and most of the time good). The direction is true Woo style. Better than the first.7,5 out of 10 can\\'t be given here, so let\\'s make that an 8 out of 10\"', '\"I know this is just a Blockbuster pop corn movie and nobody cares about nuances or giblets like geography or world traditions.The stupid idea to mix a religious fair (the traditional fair during Holy Week, before Easter in Seville, Andalusia, Southern Spain, Europe) and a non-religious-at-all-fair in Valencia, Western Spain, Europe too, \"Las Fallas\" as the same thing, should be considered a serious misdemeanor in such a high budget film like this. Mr Cruise and Mr. Woo should have hired a much more competent documentation team, and art direction team too. This is not a documentary about European traditions, but after watching this I can imagine a director from another \"undocumented\" country imagining a XXI century US where main cities has no skycrapers but small wood-made buildings, and a saloon with ignorant cow-boys riding on horses instead cars,thinking the earth is flat, and treating all bearded arabic people wear as terrorists.Moreover that stupid constant in Hollywood movies showing Spain as an undeveloped thir world country and its inhabitants as Latin Americans or Africans instead Mediterranean Europeans is somewhat funny, because it probably means that Hollywood thinks that the rest of the world thinks Spain is part of the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa or Atlantis (yes Atlantis, it exists it has borders with Syldavia .... )Thandie Newton looks African, not Spanish, many guys here probably are wishing more Spanish women were like that, but no, poor guys, here all women look so European....Anyway who cares, don\\'t you think so?. Many spectators in Spain did not care too, some just watched this part astounded, some other could not help to start laughin and some (a few) felt indignant. Advice for non Spaniards: please after watching this kind of Hollywood trash please review your geography books and maps. I hate listening things like \"I\\'m planning to visit Spain traveling by my car.... from Seattle to Spain.... Unbelievable! He just had an old Ford, neither James Bond\\'s Aston Martin, nor Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car.Oscar\"', '\"Bad boys II is a proper sequel. Not trying too hard to duplicate the first and successfully amping up the action. Smith and Lawrence have great chemistry and deliver on the humor. The action scenes are well coordinated and keep the pace of the movie moving. The plot is well developed and supporting characters are well cast. My only comment would be, again, the movie is just a bit long, some filler scenes could have been cut and the plot streamlined.\"', '\"There are no words to explain how much this film rocks. This films clearly establishes John Woo as the premiere action film director today. Add this to a list of amazing films that include The Killer, Hard Boiled and Face/Off. I loved the first film for it being a different kind of spy film. It\\'s an adventure-thriller that is pointed more toward the spy world than the action world. Any one who liked the MI will love this. At first I didn\\'t believe that Tom Cruise could pull off the action hero but he total flipped me for a loop. By the end of the film I was like \"Yeah Tom!\" It without a doubt gets a 9.57 in my book. The 2nd best film of the summer behind Shaft. If you haven\\'t seen it yet, what are you doing reading this, get out of your chair and catch this film. It is well worth the $8.50 and you\\'ll be kicking yourself if you miss it in the cinemas.\"', '\"I have been a die-hard fan of J.B. since I saw my first real Bond movie in 1979, \"Moonraker\". No- Roger Moore is NOT James Bond (never was either), but Pierce Brosnan IS! \"Goldeneye\" had some promise, followed by \"Tomorrow Never Dies\". But the last two installments get worse and worse with age. But that is the issue here- AGE! James Bond is old and tired, and just needs to retire! The creators have used up every plotline, every gadget, every villian, etc. Now they have invisible cars, machines that reconfigure one\\'s face & body perfectly, surfing commandos, etc? Now, why was it that they fired Bond in this one? And was that hotel really supposed to be made of ice? Weren\\'t J.B. and chickeroo cold when they had sex? Do you think they even did? And wasn\\'t Toby Stephens a menacing bad guy? HA-HA! Did Maculay Culkin grow up and take this part for free? And is this now tailored to fit in the Generation Y audience now? They\\'d rather see Vin Diesel in that movie last year than this old fart. Oh- but it has Halle Berry! And I\\'ve seen better dialogue in the new Star Wars movies than this!\\nMy bad! Sorry guys!This was plain stupid and a disgrace to the James Bond legacy.\"', '\"Spoilers.We see a car scene, not unlike James Bond\\'s GoldenEye scene, then an... \"intimate\" scene shortly thereafter, not unlike any James Bond movie.  Not to mention the fact that this movie tries way too hard to be cool, rather than focusing on the plot and character development.First off, Tom Cruise looks awful with long hair.  I\\'m sorry, but that just doesn\\'t look like the Ethan Hunt I remember.  Heck, Ethan Hunt is a totally different character in this one.  In the first Mission:  Impossible, Hunt was serious about his job and focused only on that.  Now he\\'s a woman-chasing, long-haired, cool guy who flashes a smile every thirty seconds or so.The plot is actually as intricate as the first Mission:  Impossible.  I realized this when I saw the movie for the third time and really understood it all.  It\\'s not explained quite as well.Now that I think about it, though, this movie seems like it has nothing to do with Mission:  Impossible.  It\\'s reverted to sex, loud guitar and crummy flamenco themes, Hunt has completely changed, and there are so many boring sequences with Ethan and Nyah that left me very angry.The music is absolutely awful.  With the exception of four tracks on the CD (which are in the movie), the rest are soft, annoying flamenco guitar strings which all sound the same.  It really makes me angry how the series went from a nice beat with great drums and action music to this junk.  The main theme isn\\'t even really the same.  It\\'s been changed into a screaming guitar.  It does, however, sound awesome on the track called \"Bare Island\", when Ethan has presumably been killed but instead runs out and pulls off his mask.M:I-2 is a completely separate story from its predecessor, which makes it that much more disappointing.  I saw this movie in theaters expecting the impossible again, but instead found an overly \"cool\" flick with too much violence.  Unlike the first, \"Zero body count!\", Hunt actually resorts to killing a bunch of innocent security guards in the laboratory.All in all, M:I-2 is a major disappointment and I would not suggest seeing it unless you are a big fan of Mission:  Impossible.  Let\\'s hope the third installment actually remembers that there were two before it.  Hunt doesn\\'t even seem to remember his whole experience with the NOC List... and Kittridge, who played a huge part before, no longer exists.Like I said, disappointing.\"', '\"I\\'m afraid that this film has become a parody of itself. Tamahori might call his sequence of loosely strung together action sketches a homage to the twenty film anniversary of Bond, but that doesn\\'t make up for the ludicrous sci-fi cgi, the thin plot, or the blackboard-scratchingly awful dialogue.I think Blofeld had the right idea. Kill it off.\"', '\"Mission Impossible II starts well, but you immediately get a taste of what is wrong with this film:  Long, slow, loving shots of Tom Cruise.  Woo once again proves he can shoot anything in slow-mo, and will.Action adventure films have a long history of being short on plot, but the good ones can make up for that with speed and pop.  This film could have used a heavy handed editor and a director less in love with his main character.\"', '\"Ocean\\'s Eleven. It\\'s become the benchmark for heist movies. It\\'s been inspired by several classics and has also been an inspiration for so many others.The funny thing about Ocean\\'s Eleven is there\\'s nothing truly outstanding about any one aspect of the movie; nothing that will blow you away. However, everything is put together perfectly.The cast oozes class. From Andy GarcÃ\\xada being immaculately dressed in a perfectly fit suit to the sheer rawness of the rag-tag squad, it all blends in beautifully.\\nThe sheer audacity of the objective of the movie is absolutely bonkers and the way they go about it is nothing short of mind blowing.Impeccable planning right to the very second as well as quick improvisation should there be a surprise encounter, this movie is of a gold standard.\\nSo much so that, it\\'s always going to be a fun rewatch irrespective of the number of times its been watched before.\"', '\"Maybe it\\'s just the \"Child of the 70s\" coming out in me, but...I loved this movie!  I went into the movie not expecting much -- like the rest of the country I guess.  But I came out of it, ready to kick some bad guy butt! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!\"', '\"Die Another Day is a great Bond flick. The reviews that cite this movie as evidence of the Bond franchise going stale picked the wrong movie; either Tomorrow Never Dies or World is Not Enough were more hackneyed than this flick. There is great action, great villains, cold war tensions, and great gadgets. Q, M, and Moneypenney are in fine form here. In fact, this outing by John Cleese is a marked improved from his shared screen time with the original Q; he can finally take over the role as his own and he\\'s a great replacement for Desmond Llewellen. The only things that detract from the movie are some poor CGI action effects, weak dialogue, and unbelievable action stunts. But it\\'s a Bond flick, so just go with it. The torture scenes are uncharacteristic of the Bond movies, but not out of line compared to the novels. After all, it\\'s the threat of torture and imminent death that motives Bond to be such a sensualist all the other times. Go see this movie and enjoy two hours of escapist fun.\"', '\"If you like to watch movies without thinking to anything smart, if you like slow-motion gunfight scenes, if you like characters without any personality ; all in all, if you love to watch popcorn movies sometimes, you\\'re gonna love M:I 2. Just don\\'t forget to leave your brain at the entrance of the cinema.Obviously, the movie is easily criticable. First, it has nothing to do with the name \"Mission Impossible\". Howerver, it is rather an excellent action movie, absurd and definitely not realistic.But if you\\'re tired, if you just want to see some excessive action, just watch M:I 2 with your friends. Otherwise, if you were expecting a serious, complex sequel to the first M:I, you\\'re gonna cry.\"', '\"Set in Los Angeles, this movie focuses on a team of thieves who hijack trucks operating a high speeds from optimally powered race cars. The cargo is then taken and sold on the black market. Needless to say, the FBI and local authorities are anxious to capture and prosecute these criminals before the truckers take matters into their own hands. To help them on this case a young police officer by the name of \"Brian O\\'Conner\" (Paul Walker) volunteers to go undercover and infiltrate the most high-profile illegal street racing team in the area which is led by a man named \"Dominic Toretto\" (Vin Diesel) who also has a prison record for violence due to his explosive temper. However, in order to investigate this case Brian first has to get inside this close-knit team and that is more difficult than anybody realizes. Additionally, this particular team is but one of many and it might not be the one responsible. But one thing is sure-action needs to be taken soon before violence erupts on the highways. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film has enough fast-paced action and drama to satisfy most fans of the genre. No doubt about it. On a more critical note though, I thought that some of the characters-most notably \"Letty\" (Michelle Rodriguez), \"Vince\" (Matt Schulze) and \"Hector\" (Noel Gugliemi)--were much too pretentious and almost to the point of being downright annoying. Likewise, some of the previously mentioned action scenes were more than a little unrealistic as well. But that\\'s Hollywood for you. In any case, from what I understand this film has turned into a profitable enterprise for Universal Pictures and since nothing succeeds like success has bred numerous sequels in its wake. That said, despite the flaws just mentioned I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.\"', '\"If you like cars - this movie is for you. Sure, the cars in this movie are not what an ordinary European lad would regard as decent, some of the parts are quite alluring (T66 with NOS you know... ;-)) but among the car bodies there are some that look way too stereotype (Honda Civics...?).The story is entertaining, though rarely sophisticated. This, I guess, is the reason for why someone reader of IMDb commented that in this movie Vin\\'s talent was wasted. I consent to this to quite some degree and really suggest to those of you, who haven\\'t already familiarized themselves with the work of this convincing actor to do so as soon as there is a chance to.\"', '\"It is not a masterpiece in general since it is not even close to being a serious movie. Still, it knows what it wants to be and it is wonderfully fine tuned to almost perfection. The plot is fairly simple and entertaining, it is nicely timed (not being a minute too short or too long) and it has a finale that stretches almost half an hour without a moment of boredom. All this makes a solid backbone for the strongest part of this movie - small details and dialogs.Except for some Tarantino movies, you will hardly find anything modern in Hollywood done which such slick dialogs and chemistry between characters. There are dozens of small and funny attachments which put the icing on the cake and make you a fan or in my case an addict:1. Rusty and Ocean together on screen 2. Rusty eating in almost every scene. There is (obviously) no need for that, but it is there. And you feel like it is natural that it should be there. 3. Amazing Yen and his conversations with others. 4. The whole joke about Linus (Matt Damon) being a rookie and trying to achieve reputation of Ocean and Rusty (and in real life Clooney and Pitt as a movie star). 5. Small, almost unnoticed comments like when Topher says \"actually, they\\'re both named Bernie\" or \"I\\'ll never forgive you for the thing with the guy in the place\". There are about a hundred of lines like that which people who watch the movie for the first time will not understand, but after several viewings they easily become insider jokes. 6. It\\'s a heist movie and yet there are no dead people and no weapons used. Not to mention no CGI, no massive explosions and no sex on screen. It can be done and it was done. 7. Fictional Lewis vs. Klicko match as a background event, brilliant. At the time they agreed only for this fictional match for the movie, the real fight was arranged months after that. 8. Best advertisement for Las Vegas ever. My trip to Vegas would not be the same without first watching this movie many times.\"', '\"There have been some pretty lame Bond films in the past (Moonraker, Golden Gun etc etc), but Die Another Day surpasses them in every way possible, and is, in my opinion, the worst Bond film ever. Yes, even worse than Never Say Never Again. How could the production team get it so wrong?For starters the plot is just downright absurd. Giant lasers in outer space, DNA replacement therapy, invisible cars, robotic suits... Fleming would be spinning in his grave.Die Another Day just tries hard to be too many things it once. It has joke-laden set pieces (such as the end scene with Moneypenny) and yet also tries to be \\'serious\\' by jamming in themes such as betrayal and father-son relationships; and including excruciating torture sequences. The central problem is a bad script. And it is bad. Just one cheesy line after another: \"Yeah, I think I got the thrust of it\", \"I see you handle your weapon well\", \"It\\'s a minefield out there\", \"How\\'s that for a punchline?\", \"I don\\'t like cock fights\", \"Yo mama!\". The introduction scene with Jinx and Bond is cringe-worthy, I almost expected Brosnan to look at the camera and say \"Yeah baby!\"Gustav Graves is a weak and unmemorable villain. This is not entirely his fault, but the fault of the producers for overloading him with gadgets and stupid gimmicks (the robotic suit for one). Jinx is very high on my list of worst Bond girls (next to Christmas Jones and Mary Goodnight) for just being plain annoying. And Rosamund Pyke couldn\\'t act her way out of a paper bag.It is not all bad, however. The first 20 minutes or so are actually pretty good (Madonna\\'s horrendous theme song aside). The hovercraft chase is very well executed and the idea of Bond being captured and imprisoned is intriguing. As for the action sequences they are mostly impressive, especially the car chase on the ice which is very well shot, and the sword fight with Bond and Graves. Though Die Another Day has been heavily criticised about it\\'s over-reliance on CGI, and not exactly top-notch CGI either. Some of the scenes (particularly the tidal wave/parachute thing and Jinx\\'s dive off the cliff) look incredibly fake, especially for Bond. Bond films are usually noted for their daring stunts, but it seems Tamahori was a little lazy in that department.Die Another Day is essentially a \\'best of Bond\\' package, and contains elements from all 19 previous films. But watching it just makes you yearn for the days when being a Bond fan was something to be proud of. Watching Die Another Day makes me feel ashamed that a series I love has sunk so low. Thankfully, the series redeemed itself with the superb Casino Royale, but it doesn\\'t disguise the fact that Die Another Day is a pathetic excuse for a Bond film. Utterly dire.\"', '\"Nothing special with this movie. \"Slick\" is not enough and you also need a story, that is as far as I concern. The dialogues were basically boring and obvious and again: \"who talks that way?\". The characters are all designed to be extremely cool but at the end is not that you really care for them and for what they are trying to do. At the end: very predictable, boring and most of all \"arrogant\" if you please...\"', '\"This film delivered more than what I was expecting. Plot was fantastic and kept me on edge several times as they were doing the heist, acting was great and overall it just really hooked me in.\\nConsidering there was 11 in the squad as well I never lost track of the characters which is quite common in films which contain a lot of main characters. To sum up if you haven\\'t watched yet I\\'d definitely give it a go. I\\'m going straight into the sequels nowOnly real negative to this is that I just wasn\\'t bothered by the romantic/love side of the plot. I could not care less if Clooney got his ex-wife back or not. It just seemed a bit pointless in the grand scheme of things. It didn\\'t take anything away from the film, but it didn\\'t hook me in as the heist did.\"', '\"Tom Cruise stars as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, who has been sent on a mission to find and bring back a sample of a deadly virus called Chimera. The other man searching for the virus is Sean Ambrose (played by Dougray Scott) a former IMF agent turned bad, he has already managed to steal the antidote Bellerophon. In order to accomplish this mission, Ethan needs the help of Luther Stickell (played by Ving Rhames), a computer expert, Billy Baird (played by John Polson) a surveillance expert and can drive or fly anything, and Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) a low level thief who had a prior fling with Sean Ambrose. Time is running out as the woman Ethan loves gets closer to death as she is infected with the deadly Chimera. Action, adventure, and some great gun fights. John Woo directs an amazing cast in one of the best action movies ever.\"', '\"I\\'m gonna give this movie 5 stars for story, action and overall fun factor. It was a great movie to see in the theatre, and when a movie is 2 1/2 hours long in the theatre, most people don\\'t wanna sit there that long. This isn\\'t your typical Lord Of The Rings crap where it\\'s 4 hours of boredom, it\\'s wall to wall action, and great storytelling to make a great action/comedy. I actually prefer this movie over the original Bad Boys because it has better action sequences, less boring parts, and a better story/plot. One thing I am WAY disappointed about and it disappoints me more and more with the fact that DVD is taking over, is the fact that Widescreen is RUINING movies! and the movie industry forces this WS crap down our throats. I just recently bought this movie (BBII) and it didn\\'t say on the box if it was full screen or wide. I don\\'t care if it\\'s both, or if it\\'s the WS ratio (1.85:1), it\\'s not that bad, but I prefer Full Screen, so I get it home and find out that it\\'s the crappy version of Widescreen (2.35:1), and then I read the aspect ratio on this site and it says that it\\'s WORSE! it\\'s actually (2.40:1), so damn man, when are the movie companies gonna realize that not everyone in the world is a rich person and/or celebrity and not everyone can afford those 1000-5000 dollar Widescreen home theater TV\\'s? I am really getting sick of the fact that they no longer make full screen movies, only the occasional movie gets released with FS, so people get cheated into buying a movie that doesn\\'t say which aspect ratio, or doesn\\'t even say widescreen or Full Screen so people can pick and choose the one they want. I bet way more people buy FS versions than these crappy WS versions. But oh well, I will end this by saying I am VERY disappointed with my copy of Bad Boys 2, and recommend that people DON\\'T buy it if they hate Widescreen like I do. Don\\'t waste your money. When they play the movie on the movie networks, they are full screen so what the heck is the deal there? why can\\'t they release it to the public? Well that\\'s all from this disappointed Bad Boys fan.\"', '\"(This is a corrected version of the review already submitted)   I wonder if John Woo or Tom Cruise, or anybody associated with this film is actually proud of the product they created?  Do you think they were all tied to some contract and had to make it, or some guys from the studio would come and cut off their thumbs or something?  I\\'m really at a loss on this one.      This was just about the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  Now I\\'ll admit, I haven\\'t gotten around to seeing Battlefield Earth yet, so that distinction may change, but for now, yes, the worst.  This movie embodies all the things that are wrong with big budget action movies in Hollywood. To start, it was nothing more than a vanity project on behalf of Tom Cruise. Like a lot of highly-paid leading men, his contract clearly stipulated that he not be in the film unless his character is the ultimate bad-ass of all time.  Forget the fact that there was no character to play, he doesn\\'t even need a name, Ethan Hunt, forget it, just call him \"hero\".  That\\'s all there is to it.  And wasn\\'t the \"romance\" of the film so well done as well?  I mean, he did know this woman for a whole weekend before he was madly in love and willing to risk his life for her, so it all works.     Then there\\'s our bad guy played by Dougray Scott, who, like our hero, is so generic and predictable he can just be called \"villain\", nothing more. Like all action movie bad-guys, he\\'s only interested in money, and he\\'ll just keep on blowing up busloads of nuns and clubbing baby seals until he gets it.  And he looks just like Tom Cruise when he\\'s wearing a Tom Cruise mask, even though he, like most men, is a half a foot taller than Tom Cruise!  But hey, its an action movie, it doesn\\'t have to make sense.  Oh but there\\'s more... The plot of MI2 was so weak and subordinate to the action scenes that most reviewers at the time simply described it as \"having something to do with a virus\".  Yes that is definitely the way to put it, there\\'s nothing more than that.  But since they had to pay $20 million for Tom Cruise\\'s salary, they couldn\\'t afford to hire anyone who knows anything about viruses as a consultant. So we get a movie that\\'s on par with Armageddon where realism is concerned.   I could write a book about why this movie sucked, so let me just try and wrap it all up:   The plot was almost non-existent, the characters were derivative, one-dimensional, and uninteresting, the action was over-the-top, ridiculous, and generally an insult to the audience\\'s intelligence (particularly at the very end).  Oh yes, and I almost forgot, occasionally brilliant actor Anthony Hopkins was in a couple of minutes of the film, further revealing to us that he\\'ll act in absolutely anything, just so long as the check clears.     To put it mildly, all people associated with the production of Mission Impossible II should be deported to third-world countries that do not yet possess the technology to make motion pictures so they can\\'t waste 125 million dollars on s**t like this again.\"', '\"A fresh approach on the classic action flick, complete with fist fights, exploding cars and scantily dressed women.  While it\\'s not Oscar material, it\\'s a fun, fast ride with simple, likable characters easy to root for and exciting to watch.  Vin Diesel\\'s performance is one of the film\\'s highlights along with the heart-pounding effects and action sequences.  While the plot is a bit thin, the film delivers what it promises and doesn\\'t profess to be something it\\'s not.  I liked it enough to buy the DVD and I\\'ve watched it several times.\"', '\"What a rush! This is the best movie of the summer, without a doubt. Fast cars and hot girls is the main theme of the movie. So the plot may be a bit weak, and some of the lines are tacky, but I\\'m talking about non stop action. Great stunts and car chase scenes, along with awesome camera angles. They don\\'t ruin the film with any CGI\\'s, it\\'s all real. After leaving the theater the parking lot was roaring, people were gunning their engines and racing off. I wanted to speed out of the theater doing 140mph...a very excited 9/10\"', '\"I just saw \"Die Another Day\", and realized that nothing is impossible. As an irked and disgruntled dedicated Bond fan, with a solid claim of having viewed all the 20 Bond movies over the years, I was convinced that Bond movies would not succumb lower than the deplorable standards set by \"The World Is Not Enough\". Well, tonight I stand corrected. They have done it.Granted, \"The World Is Not Enough\" does not rate as low as the despicable \"Moonraker\"(The absolute worst), or \"A View To A Kill\", or \"On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service\". But it took away the charm of the Bond flicks to an extend. I would have thought they\\'d learn their lesson, take a bow, and move on. But through skillful direction, rigid scripts, and impeccable craftsmanship, \"Die Another Day\" actually makes one appreciate the comparatively slight misgivings of \"The World Is Not Enough\". I guess I have that much to thank this movie for. I love Brosnan as Bond, and it seems so bad that his last two installments have been, mildly speaking, inadequate. Rosamund Pike strikes way off. The director probably slept through the production. Desmond Lewellyn (The Old Q) is sorely missed, although his replacement, John Cleese, is doing okay. The villain also lacks a certain panache. Other than a genuinely thrilling (though short lived)high speed hi tech chase, the movie was, by and large, an undisguised insult to the Bond genre.Bond movies used to be special.And on that note, let this critic close this review.Signing off, I remainJoy, Hamish Joy\"', '\"Although I enjoyed Daniel Craig\\'s ice cold spin on 007 , Pierce Brosnan will always be one of my favourite Bonds. Die another Day is proof to show with how much great ease he plays the character and is a joy to watch. The plot this time involves North Korea and is used rather nicely with the movie and tries not to be TOO political but stays fun. Given that this is the 20th Bond movie watch carefully for several reference to Bond movies of the past which make it a blast and also fun , not to mention 007 catchy one liners which always make it a joy. I felt there was a little 007 atmosphere missing from this movie like their was in Goldeneye but then what it lacks for in atmosphere it makes up for in action , gadgets and I don\\'t care what anyone says the Aston Martin rocks ! Brosnan gives us shades of a Bond who is willing to break the rules which kind of paves the way for Craig I guess , but then I was very impressed with Halle Berry who leaves a mark as one of best Bond Girls as well as Rosamund Pike , Tobey Stevens and Rick Yune were also very good. The locations were nice , I have always wanted to go to Cuba and it was good to have been given a taste of that. The action was brilliant! To conclude , I know that some people don\\'t really like this Bond movie but for me and select few it is a great time out , to me personally it is one of the best Bond movies and not mention Brosnan\\'s last before he was unfairly screwed out of Bond , and it is certainly one of my favourites although their was a little bit too much CGI used which looked fake in most places and Madonna (who I can\\'t stand) was in it.DIE ANOTHER DAY - 8.1 OUT OF 10EVENTS DON\\'T COME ANY BIGGER THAN...\"', '\"Definitely one of the worst Bonds of all time.  As an avid Bond fan expecting more from each new film as the Brosnan series has gotten better as it has gone along.  This film is totally disjointed and even more then usual the plot is weaker than ever.... it seems to be trying to appeal to a younger audience with clever directorial tricks, none of which come off.... the whole film is a mess and I could not wait for the film to end.....  I think Bond should become more mature and adult in the future..... otherwise by trying to appeal to a more disinterested younger audience the people who grew up enjoying Bond will also become disinterested.....Its time the producers got some guts.\"', '\"Ya know when you have a film that borders on A & B yet just cant quite make ups its mind? Thats my fast take on this high octane red line effort. Especially if your a youngster into the whole car group racing thing, then your gonna \\'Love\\' this film. Yet if you look deeper to the qualities that make an all around good film, then you\\'ll be a bit dissapointed, yet still you will be entertained. The best part about this film to me was watching for the first time, actor \\'Paul Walker\\' Being a cross resemblance of Timothy Hutton and Rob Lowe, Paul Walker is an actor I\\'m keeping an eye on. Though I\\'ve never seen him, this Southern California native is no stranger to acting and will have me viewing some of his past work. The directing and some of the writing was a bit adolescent yet at times (such as during certain action/race sequences), it made good quarter mile time. No, not a waste of money, especially since finding Paul Walker, yet not a film Vin Diesel should hold up to the light. Worth the watch, worth the video rental, yet it wont be in my collection.\"', '\"This average piece of celluloid isnÂ´t what I was waiting for the whole summer. I had hopes, but now IÂ´m 100% sure that Mr Cruise should have done only the stunts and leave the close ups for a REAL actor. There are only three variations of emotion in this pretty face: The smile (a favourite!), The IÂ´m serious thinking-mask and The tight-lips hard boy face. ThatÂ´s not enough to persuade me of all the super power skills that he is gifted with.IÂ´ve seen all those uncomparable Woo-movies with Chow Yun-Fat and John Travolta. These actors are able to lift a action movie over the whole distance. IÂ´m serious: IÂ´m not a guy who always expects a Brando/de Niro/Eastwood/Connery etc.-personality to keep a movie going. But Mr Cruise ruins this wannabe Bond with his zero-personality.In addition this movie has the most predictible story of all Woo movies available. There is not a single surprise (donÂ´t you think this mask-thing is a little bit overdone?).2/10 for Cruise, 3/10 for dialoges 9/10 for John Woo and the sound design\"', '\"But it doesn\\'t, it just fills the screen with stars old and new who all have nothing to do except spout cliches and look stupid. It\\'s vapid, early 2000\\'s autopilot; it\\'s artless and completely forgettable. Affleck is miscast, I want to like him, but the scenery he\\'s trying to chew is asbestos. Contrived, mind-numbing, hogwash, claptrap.\"', '\"I have read a lot of reviews on The Fast and the Furious, and most of them were negative.. I saw the fast and the furious twice and I thought it was a really good movie, despite what anyone says. Many people say the actors were crap and didnt act well, but what do you expect? It\\'s not supposed to be going for academy awards here. Its only a low budget film anyway. As for the actors, what is there to say in a movie about cars? \"I love you, I hope we\\'ll always be together?\" I dont think so! The script was very realistic if you ask me.The fast car racing was great, and the cars were even better. If you\\'re not into cars then don\\'t see the movie.. I thought the movie was really good and if you like fast cars, street racers and any of the actors whether they are male or female then i definately recommend you go see this!\"', '\"What was John Singleton thinking? I don\\'t know... First of all the original \"Shaft\" worked only because of the time period it was made in and I only realized this 1/2 way through the awful new one. The story is introduced with Christian Bale\\'s rascist Walter Wade J.R. as the main villain in a pumped up opening scene that promises, at least, a decent action-revenge plot. But instead, mid-way through the production, the filmmakers decided that Jefferey Wright\\'s Peoples Hernandez was a more interesting villain (they are right) but they then reduce Bale to a minor part,(eliminating an end scene which was a key to why Bale chose the part)  Bale\\'s reduction is espcially disappointing because they easilly could have worked out a sort of partnership between the two villains. They even suggest it in the film, but never followed up on it. This leaves a week plot which gives Jackson nothing much to do other then ask a lady bartender if she wants the \"L.D.\" However much worse then anything I\\'ve mentioned so far is the completely idiotic and unsatisfying ending which looked like it was thrown together quickly so Singleton could get this crap done with as soon as possible. And in the end I felt and learned nothing more about John Shaft than I saw in the 5 second commercial on FOX. Wright and Bale remain the real stars of the movie, you almost feel bad because they are so much more intriguing then Shaft himself which I\\'m sure was not Singleton\\'s intention.\"', '\"OK, this film will not appeal to all of you....not everybody likes fast cars and smolderingly beautiful young women, which is a large part of what goes on here....But, the film is worth seeing for the wonderful location photography that captures Los Angeles and environs with brilliant clarity. Few other recent movies have given a better view and impression of Southern California. From the gritty yet palm studded industrial areas to the brilliantly clear California Desert near Palm Springs, this film has a sense of place that has rarely been equaled. I could go on, but I\\'ll spare you....see it! My only gripe is that the female characters should have had tattoos....as so many women do have them and these characters would too!\"', '\"I saw this movie last summer when it first came out and it is definitely THE WORST movie I have EVER seen in my life! Even with the hot sexy Asian guys! There was no plot at all! It was just a bunch of people driving cars. What the f#$% was the point of the movie???!!!! If you want to see fast cars you can just go to a NASCAR race or something. There was absolutely NO PLOT in this stupid movie. Just fast cars. I can\\'t believe I spent $5.00 to see this stupid piece of crap. I\\'d rather eat my toes than ever see this movie again. A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.\"', '\"Men in Black II may have benefited from the \"Batman\" franchise in that it doesn\\'t try to juggle too many new elements.  L (Linda Florentio in MIB I) doesn\\'t appear here which is sad, given the development of the character in the MIB Animated Series, but probably also fortunate as screen time is devoted to enriching Jay and Kay, the new villian---Lara Flynn Boyle, wonderfully funny as the Victoria Secret\\'s model look-alike alien (favorite scene--her chomping down on a huge burger that any working model would consider a meal for a week)---and adding TWO love interests (the gorgeous Rosario Dawson being the one we see, alas, not frequently enough).  Frank and the worms steal scene after scene and Rip Torn\\'s Zed gets a great mano-a-non-mano scene with Boyle\\'s alien.  The scripts fun, the direction keeps things moving and Tommy Lee Jones again anchors the whole with his earnest, deadpan delivery.  And, oh, yeah, Will Smith\\'s good, too (though, he is allowed too much time to do physical schtick towards the end that undercuts the maturation of his character as witnessed prior to Jones\\' return.\"', '\"It\\'s not Pierce Brosnan\\'s fault. He does his thing, an adequate but decidedly low-key Bond (you want to check his pulse sometimes). But I\\'d call it the \"Moonraker\" of the Brosnan era, although that would be insulting \"Moonraker.\" Cringeworthy CGI, silly and gratuitous special effects (a villain who shoots electric rays... what is this, Star Wars?), hokey science even by the Bond series\\' standards (and that\\'s saying something). Starts off promisingly and goes downhill, WAY downhill, in the second hour. Way too much Halle Berry -- whatever happened to the days when all the focus was on 007? Bond girls, whether they are sex objects or secret agents, need to STAY OUT OF BOND\\'S SPOTLIGHT. Oh, and Madonna\\'s title song is horrible, horrible, awful, the worst in the 40 years of the series.\"', '\"Nothing that has not been done over 25 times, way too predictable to be any good.

As for the plot, very, very weak\"', '\"This movie has been given quite a few negative reviews but i don\\'t fit in accordance of such opinions. movie is quite gripping from the start and impressed a lot to me. May choosing ben affleck as jack ryan is not a decision but apart from this the film contained a lot of events regarding war , terrorism, espionage and spy games. The plot deals with on growing threat of strain relationship of governments and emergence of terrorist leaders who just want to take advantage of on going sensitive situations. Morgan freeman at least played good part to his character , he completely did justice with his roll , James Cromwell was good as American president and cairan hinds was impressive as Russian president. Even after the detonation of nuclear bomb ,ben affleck become very emotionally active and charged into the movie, there was now some power in his character. the movie isn\\'t bad any way whatever someone may think, there wasn\\'t any time no any suspense and Adrenalin was found in the story. Liev schriber was good special induction to assist affleck in bringing forward the story. it may not be every body ,s choice but it wont disappoint much\"', '\"Men In Black ended with Agent Jay mind wiping Agent Kay so that he can live a happy life or so we think. Men In Black II opens up with Jay chasing down an alien that lives in the NYC subway system and is a threat to the city. Jay has in time become one of their best agents but he has a habit of mind wiping his partners because they don\\'t want to be MIB agents anymore so he\\'s kind of tainted in that respect. During all of this an alien named Serleena arrives on Earth Serleena is played to the hilt by Laura Flynn Boyle and she hams it up nicely her sidekick played by Johnny Knoxville could use a little bit of work but he does OK. Serleena arrives and takes over MIB HQ it seems she\\'s looking for a object of great power that KAy hid long ago under the protection of a guardian. Jay Escapes and he realizes MIB\\'s only chance is to bring Kay back to the fold restore his memories and defeat Serleena. When Tommy Lee Jones makes his appearance the movie picks up considerably and it\\'s very nicely understood that while Smith is the maniacal energy and the comedic relief Tommy Lee Jone simply is the heart of Men In Black while Rip Torn as Zed is the Soul. Without these three actors Men In BLack would not be as good there is something about the dynamic here that the three bring to the table. My only complaint as with the first was that it was too short Sonnifeld is a gifted directer and Knows how to make great movies with the MIB series he really should think about lengthen the running time so the movie does not feel as rushed and we can enjoy it as it unfolds.\"', '\"Contrary to the other post I have seen on this movie, I enjoyed it. I have to admit that it was definitely predictable at some points but other parts did keep you guessing, especially if you didn\\'t read movie inlay/plot sumary. I\\'m sure many will agree though, anything it lost in predictability it made up with sheer horse-power and speed. The cinematography techniques used in this movie to enhance the viewers experience with the speed were excellently designed and implemented. I was especially glad to see a movie about fast cars and racing that didn\\'t break down into some romance or deep-felt-drama. It kept its side topics light and its main plot prominant.I recommend viewing this movie, it was worth the Â£3.75 rental charge.\"', '\"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. As said I the title if you line hustle then this is a fabulous film. With twists till the end\"', '\"It seems that the writing team behind M:I2 said to each other: \"Ok, the last movie turned out to be too convoluted and messy for the average movie goer to comprehend. So this time around, let\\'s make the plot as simple, cheesy and predictable as possible, and stuff it full with the tired cliches and those cool mask-ripping tricks that the viewer can anticipate ten minutes beforehand. Let\\'s make the dialogue as dumb and laughable as possible, with pearlers like \"Damn, you\\'re beautiful\" or \"I\\'m not gonna lose you!\". Let\\'s include a few pretty shots of Sydney\\'s Opera House, but never make any real use of the location. Let\\'s cut most of John Woo\\'s violent poetry to a minimum; after all, a PG-13 rating means more success at the box-office! And to make the film seem like a thinking man\\'s action movie, let\\'s pretend to do some \"character development\" in the first half by including a romance that shall grind the whole movie to a halt.\"And here we have it, ladies and gentlemen: another soulless summer turkey that most people dislike and some passionately hate (judging by the responses I read on the net), but which nevertheless will make more than $200 million in America and another $200 million overseas.What a waste of talent, this movie. Thandie Newton is an amazingly beautiful woman, but there is no chemistry whatsoever between her and Cruise; their relationship, which is supposed to be the heart and soul of the film, is never convincing or passionate. Her character starts out interestingly enough, as a smart, sexy professional who could be Hunt\\'s equal, sort of like Michel Yeoh to Pierce Brosnan in \"Tomorrow Never Dies\". Then she quickly dissolves into the thankless role of a girlfriend, whose main purpose is to act as a helpless hostage and be saved by the hero. Her facial expressions seem to alternate between two main modes: staring longingly with a seductive smile on her lips, or looking worried and vulnerable.Dougray Scott is an AWFUL villain. His accent is so painfully ridiculous, he overacts so badly that I couldn\\'t help giggling from time to time. The worst thing, though, is that his character is sooo terminally dull. We learn absolutely nothing about his past or the motives for betraying his former employers. His scenes with Cruise lack tension and intensity, the kind of \"we-hate-each-others-guts\" feel that underlines the best villain-hero relationships. Hunt and Ambrose do suit each other in a way that both of those characters have zero personality and believability. Which brings us to Tom Cruise and his hero. Ethan Hunt has to be the blandest, dullest James Bond rip-off. He has no visible personality traits or quirks, no particular reasons to like or admire him, he\\'s a nobody, really. He looks good and grins a lot, but that\\'s about it. And as much as I like Tom Cruise and admire him as an actor, I could never buy him as a John Woo action hero. He\\'s way too short, for one thing, and all his attempts to act all macho and intense brought giggles from me and others in the cinema.Let\\'s see, who else? Ving Rhames is totally wasted, spending most of his time looking worriedly at the computer screen and cracking unfunny jokes. Anthony Hopkins brings his usual charisma and dignity to the role of Hunt\\'s superior, but his classy appearance is too brief to save the film.Don\\'t get me wrong, I know that most of the action movies are not about good acting, characters, dialogue or plot. They can be as over-the-top improbable as they damn like, I\\'m not one of those nitpickers who roll their eyes during some crazy action scene and say \"yeah, right\". But when a supposedly action movie lacks any tension whatsoever, all the weak elements come to surface more clearly. I can ignore shallow characters, dumb dialogue and simplistic plot, but I can never forgive dullness and the lack of genuine excitement. And M:I2 was DULL with capital D.Apart from the motorcycle chase which was pretty neat, there was no action scene that didn\\'t remind me of another similar action scene in a much better movie. It even rips the original M:I\\'s most famous scene, with Cruise being suspended on a cord. I suppose it was intended as a wink-wink reference, but it comes off as trite and recycled instead. There\\'s way too much slow motion, and what\\'s the deal with those constant close-ups on the face?I went to this movie with no expectations other than having a blast of a time without putting any pressure on the brain. Instead, it disappointed me on every single level I could think of. I give it 1 out of 10.\"', '\"A long-awaited sequel.  Never had I heard so much bad word-of-mouth about a film even before it was released.  I was very disappointed in Men In Black II.  I somewhat enjoyed the first film. Will Smith seems to play the same smart-aleck character in every film he does.  In this one, he is cutting people off in mid-sentence wanting them to shut-up.  Being rude and insulting to white people in this film really turned me off.  Bad writing. I didn\\'t feel there was enough screen time for Tommy Lee Jones.  Is there a plot in this film?  Interesting was the cameo appearance of singer/actor/entertainer Michael Jackson.  Perhaps Michael Jackson would have been better than Will Smith  (Michael Jackson was good in THE WIZ [1978]). The outtakes were of just more of Will Smith wasting more valuable time just to be silly and get attention.  The Blooper reel shows how unprofessional Will Smith can be whereas Tommy Lee Jones can prove how much of a consummate actor he is.  Tommy Lee Jones can be serious and jump right back into character when the director needs it.  The sequel just might have killed the entire Men In Black franchise once and for all.  Will Smith and Special Effects does not always work for a film.  Men In Black means \"black suit\" not \"ethnic\".  I would like to see Tommy Lee Jones do a Men In Black without Will Smith.  I liked the alternate ending where Will Smith was put in the egg pod.  Perhaps that is where they should have cut and ended the film right there.  Watch Tommy Lee Jones in THE EYES OF LAURA MARS (1978).\"', '\"This movie is one of the most forgettable films of all time, at least the most forgettable thriller. In the forums, in almost all the cinema magazines, people say that Ben Affleck\\'s acting is wooden, he is too straight faced and he is always the same in all his movies. I disagree. He is not a great actor yes, but not that much. They exaggerate. Therefore, the problem of the movie is neither Ben Affleck, nor Morgan Freeman, it is the movie itself. By the way, it is too painful that its rating is much more higher than some very good action thriller movies, especially made in 1990s. The movie is an action movie which includes almost no action. This is the first fear. I had started to watch the film by the hope of seeing an exciting, action thriller movie like Mission Impossible movies, for example but all I got was a too slow paced movie. No car chase, no pursuit, no gunfight. There is an explosion scene, but even it is not remarkable at all, because we cannot see the explosion, wee see the events after that. The rest of the movie is conversations, phone conversations and conversations again. Additionally, the movie is not stylish, \\'normal\\'. Another fear. As said, this is not a remarkable movie, no prominent scene! My third fear. The movie is not enjoyable at all, from the first minute till the last, even that off screen explosion scene. You know, there are some movies, not good movies, but real enjoyable. This movie is not one of them. The third fear. The Sum of All The Fears.\"', '\"When I first saw the trailer for Ocean\\'s Eleven, I wanted to see it. It had a different tone than other movies usually do.

It has an simple, but interesting plot: George Clooney (Danny Ocean) is released from prison and meets up with Bernie Mac who works at a casino. Then he conspires with Brad Pitt to pull off a job to rob three casinos. They then get eight other guys to pull off the job.Other than the plot, the movie is well directed. The acting from all people in the film is superb. The movie is very funny which is a plus because audiences should laugh.Ocean\\'s Eleven is just one of those movies with a classic film atmosphere that\\'s just a good movie to sit down and watch.SCORE: 8 out of 10\"', '\"After having seen this movie more than eight times (not by choice), I\\'ve come to realize that the original lukewarm reviews I read were correct: this film is not much better than mediocre. That\\'s not to say that the film is terribleÂ—it\\'s notÂ—or that you shouldn\\'t watch itÂ—you shouldÂ—but rather that it has many flaws, some of them glaring.Ask most people why they saw the movie, and they\\'ll say something like \"It has George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it,\" or \"It has Julia Roberts in it,\" or \"Stephen Soderbergh directed it.\" Ocean\\'s Eleven is a \"People\" magazine reader\\'s dream come true. So many celebrities in one movie: what bliss! The point is that Ocean\\'s Eleven is not meant to be strong on character or plot; it\\'s meant to be strong on Star Power. In fact, it\\'s surprising that there is a plot, such as it is. It follows the new Blockbuster code: Hot Bad Guys who are actually Good Guys want to steal money from crooked, mean Big Businessman; they make elaborate plans, use fancy equipment, and ultimatelyÂ…but we all know the ending. Soderbergh may court the strange, the offbeat, the underbelly of society, but he also knows that when making an action movie one should not deviate too much from the tried-and-true. He gives us what we want, and more.George Clooney and Brad Pitt as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, respectively, are the most likable of the bunch. They have a rapport that either is natural, or was rehearsed so effectively and so well that it became natural. They\\'re like Laurel and Hardy, only with stubble and expensive suits. They eat each other\\'s lines, insult each other, show off in front of each otherÂ—in some ways they\\'re a more compelling couple than Clooney and Roberts.Incidentally, Julia Roberts, apparently confusing Tess Ocean with Erin Brockovich, gives an intensity to her role of The Chick that is entirely inappropriate. This is an action movie, not a chance to win another Oscar. She delivers lines like she\\'s chopping onions: short, quick, and full of force. Of course, her dramatic skill is unquestionable, but in this case a lighter touch would have been more fitting. I can understand her desire, if she had it, of wanting to give more weight to her role as Clooney\\'s ex-wife and Andy Garcia\\'s new girlfriend; it must be frustrating to be a piece of meat that men fight over. But she should have been more perceptive of the movie\\'s genre and its requirements. In action movies, chicks should look hot and be tough; not much more is (usually) required.The fact is, we hardly ever think of Roberts, or any of the other Big Names, as anything but who they are off the set. Although Garcia calls Roberts \"Tess\" several times, somehow the name always rings false. The other cast members, being less famous, have the advantage of being able to play their characters more convincingly.This movie was a remake of another all-star movie made in 1960. (I\\'ve been unable to see more than snippets, and since I currently live out of the US I\\'m not able to rent it.) Most reviews refer to this previously made film, but the fact is that Soderbergh\\'s Ocean\\'s Eleven is its own entity. We should judge it not based on its predecessor, but on its own meritsÂ—unfortunately too few.When I first saw this movie, it was dubbed in Spanish, and I thought it was well made, well acted, and generally better than most action movies. (Of course, I was on a date at the time, so I wasn\\'t scrutinizing every detail.) Upon subsequent viewing, however, this movie\\'s imperfections only become more glaring. It\\'s too bad. Although you won\\'t think you\\'ve wasted two hours if you watch it for the first time, this movie is not one that you\\'ll return to over and over againÂ—that kind of film where each time you see it you discover more of the director\\'s ingenuity, or the actors\\' skill, or the screenwriter\\'s craft. This movie is good for a quick laugh and a thrill, but, like cake, it\\'s not ultimately what will satisfy your hunger.\"', '\"I must admit that I did like the first mission impossible film quite a bit but this film is just poor in anybody\\'s book. This film sees the return of Ethan hunt as he looks to stop an old ally from releasing a deadly virus on the world. Now I really did like tom cruise\\'s performance in the first film but something just seems a bit off with him in this film. I mean he still does a decent job but he just seemed lethargic and not really interested. The side characters are a mixed bag with both the villain and his main henchman being more like cartoons then realistic representations of what villains should be in a film like this. But I thought Ethan\\'s New love interest nya did a good job and she has pretty good chemistry with cruise even tough the story does make it hard to believe. Also another thing I liked is that they gave ving rhames\\'s character luthor a bigger role in this and I believe he does a really good job easily being my favourite character in the film. In the first film one thing I really liked was the story and the twists and turns they took but in this film there is no such luck. The story is unnecessarily complicated and none of the reasoning for actions are ever really explained at all. The script is okay with hunt and nya having some good dialogue between them but also none of the villains had any good lines and a lot of the dialogue did feel forced. But easily the biggest complaint I have with this film is its style of the film. There was so much slow motion it became insulting and it really took me out of the film. This film is a massive let down and makes me look less forward to the 3rd film.\"', '\"I really enjoyed this movie, as I have the entire Bond series, but I wasn\\'t dazzled by it like some of its predecessors. I heard there were references all the previous Bond movies hidden within this movie. I didn\\'t find them all -- I would like to see a listing -- but having found several, I believe it to be a true statement. One real disappointment in the movie was the music.  Don\\'t take this wrong, because I actually enjoy much of Madonna\\'s work, but this is the bar none worst theme of the entire series.  Overall, the movie had a little too much computer techno stuff and not enough of what made Bond movies Bond movies -- the music, quick wittedness and panoramic views.In as much as I expect Bond to continue, I think they need to sit down and go over the greatness/weakness factors and rediscover some of it. I wish a little peon like myself could actually have a discussion with those with the power inside the Bond organization. I just might have something useful to contribute.\"', '\"I know this is an action movie but the \"action\" is so unbelievable as to be ridiculous. Even the futuristic props in the early James Bond films were more believable than this movie. The script, the action, the \"plot\" are all (here is that word again) ridiculous. Next time they should just update the old TV show - and replace Tom Cruise... with anybody. I don\\'t know that this movie was intended to do - other than capitalize on the MI name and make more money. I resisted seeing this film for a long time, but not long enough. Anyone who has not yet seen this movie and is wondering whether to take the time to do so would be well advised to do something else -- anything but watch this movie!\"', '\"The first one MI:1 was way better, this one is like a James Bond, but doesn\\'t have the \"same old panache \" of a james movie. The team thing is missing, the first one is not perfect too for this point, but at least Brian de palma had try.  The only thing cool in that movie was the unbelievable bike chase. My rate 6/10.\"', '\"In my opinion a vast improvement compared to the 1995 Bad Boys! Beautiful cinematography throughout, well written, hilarious, and epic action; I love this movie. I remember I originally saw it on Halloween when I was around 12 years old, still a blast glad I own it now on Blu-Ray. So many awesome quotes that stuck with me for a long time and high budgeted sequences which is fun to watch when it\\'s done right like in this case I don\\'t have complaints.\"', '\"I don\\'t know what several of these people are smoking.The movie was great.Cast: Not too shabby, Vin Desil was perfect for the part. i couldn\\'t really picture anyone else there.Storyline:People say its only drag races blah blah. No it\\'s about an undercover cop that is trying to break a truck hijacking ring, but he becomes soft on Vin and his gang, and love gets in the way of his work as well.The race scenes  were cool. The final one was my favorite, :-).And hot girls, oh COME ON... They are in the background, maybe the movie would be alittle better if ya took your eyes off the girls.As for the cheesy one liners, you anwser me this. In reality who comes up with an really cool saying? So of  course it is gonna be cheesy.I rate it an 7 because I have seen better movies like, gone in 60 seconds and no man\\'s land.My advice is to see this movie!\"', '\"When I went to the movies one day in the summer it was a choice between Sum of all Fears and Bourne.  I chose Bourne and hated it, though I didn\\'t mind Matt Damon.  Here I thought I would hate it and I didn\\'t.  I thought Ben Afflick made a terrible Jack Ryan, very little emotion.  The guy is great to look at but can\\'t act.  But the rest of the cast was just fine.  It was a good story though it reminded me a lot of Fail Safe.  But overall I\\'m not sorry I rented it.\"', '\"I saw this film with great expectation. John Woo is known for excellent action sequences and there were some of these, but why did they all have to be in slow motion? It is not as action packed if everything is slowed down. Also it could have been an hour and a half if everything was at normal speed.  It looked like he had seen The Matrix too many times.As for the story, it was a very simple plot and you always knew who the bad guy was, even when he was wearing a mask. I really enjoyed the twists in the first one. The use of the flashback was exceptional there. Other camera angles you didn\\'t catch were made clear later. In this one, I could have gone to sleep for an hour and woken up at the end to have entire sequences replayed for me in flashback. I truly think this movie was made on the 3rd grade level so that no one would miss anything or have any excuse to see it again (bad for business). It was all an excuse for Tom Cruise to show off (the stunts he did were pretty impressive). More Luther is needed in the next sequel, which I am sure there will be. Hopefully they put a little more thought into the script.\"', '\"this movie was surprisingly excellent in every way who knew will smith could act and get this so can martin Lawrance the action in this was some of the best I\\'ve seen in a while. the comedy was very well delivered this was a lot better than the first the sequel surpasses the original the first was way to drawn out and you found yourself wanting to hit the projectionist just so the movie would end this one far succeeds in keeping you hooked into the wild roller coaster ride this is a must see even for the the will smith haters like me give it a try you won\\'t be disappointed just so you know this isn\\'t how itype but the sometimes annoying guidelines said i had to add more lines grrr\"', '\"its one of the john woo,s best film... by seeing this movie i became fan of john woo.. tom cruise is looking great. bike stunts are very good.. it is the movie mixed with sci-fi, action,stunt,love,style.. you will get what ever you want in this film..it is great pleasure to watch this film, music is great, screenplay is great, if you are a action lover then it is a must see film for you.. the stunts in this film are mind blowing.. it appears that the action is little over.. but for a john woo film it is a must.. the story is good. totally you will get your money back from this..\"', '\"This film was totally flat.  The plot was there, the acting tried hard, but in the end, it was a bunch of supposedly cool people trying too hard to act cool.  And it sucked.  Another clock-watcher.  7/10 For the cinematography and the music, and pieces of well-structured dialogue, though their execution was taxing, and the jokes were void.\"', '\"How stupid is Shanghai Noon? Pretty stupid. How entertaining is the film? Pretty entertaining. What we have here is the typical \"no brains\" action comedy and at times while I watched the movie I laughed not because of the jokes, but because how silly the film was. But Shanghai Noon is a rather entertaining movie and Owen Wilson adds some charm, too bad there\\'s at least one fight too many in the film. (4/10)\"', '\"I rented this because I was in desperate need of something mindless, silly, and (hopefully) funny.  I knew it would be mindless, and I hoped it would be silly.  What a pleasant surprise that it was also funny.As a sequel, MIB 2 was inspired.  After all, no one was going to laugh at the set up again.  More of the same would be--ell, more of the same.  So what makes it a good sequel is the humor--particularly the great sense of the timing on the jokes.  This is true comic writing and comic cinematic direction.The autopilot, for example, is a perfect, wordless joke--brilliantly conceived and executed.  And the train station locker is another, off-the-wall concept--unexpected and unusual.Another directorial success is in not having Jones exactly reprise his character.  His interpretation of the disgruntled, skeptical, and authoritarian postmaster is both dead-pan and inspired--timing, again. K is both crabbier and more in control than he was before his nebulizaiton, even though he has to cope with being 5 years behind on the MIB technology.\\nHe is still sad and wistful about his role in the universe; and moreover, things have happened to him in his 5 years off the force, things that they tell on his personality.  Kudos to Jones and Sonnenfeld for sketching in these changes.There are also some nice one liners.  I won\\'t repeat them, because then you won\\'t find them funny.  But check out J\\'s response to the dog\\'s advice on romance.  Pure wit, crude and simple.To top it off, this movie is short enough not to wear out its welcome, and is not extended with  interminable shoot-em-ups and car chases.\"', '\"This movie was a HUGE disappointment.  The acting was mediocre at best, the action scenes were a little too removed from reality (and therefore appeared \\'stupid\\').  The story itself was quite weak....overall a waste of money, time, and perfectly good celluloid!!  If I could give this one a -10 I would...a movie that was actually WORSE than Mchale\\'s Navy!!!  Never thought I\\'d see the day :(\"', '\"Like Mission:  Impossible\\'s excellence in espionage performance, Ocean\\'s Eleven follows along the same track with cunning thievery, great cast, enjoyable music, and above average plot.  I was surprised to find this movie to be much, much more than a dim-witted attempt at something like Gone in 60 Seconds (which was a poor remake of an ancient film).George Clooney hits the spotlight as a recently released prisoner.  He wants to go back to his life of crime and rob a ring of casinos in Las Vegas. Immediately the movie jumps into the plot, as he meets up with Brad Pitt\\'s character and together they plan the world\\'s greatest robbery.  The amount of time spent and effort put into this theft is amazing, and I could not tear my eyes away from the screen as their plan slowly took form.  The moviemakers surely have brains with enormous capacity to do all this.Ocean\\'s Eleven is based off an older movie, but I\\'m not sure how closely it matches its counterpart.  I\\'ve not seen it, so I can\\'t comment on that.The music, although not a huge part of the movie, was great and fit in perfectly.  Not too heavy and loud, but up enough so that it filled the atmosphere with a sneaky attitude that made me think of the NOC list download in Mission:  Impossible.The only downside I can find of Ocean\\'s Eleven is the huge lack of character development.  Most of the super-thieves we meet in the movie are hardly explained.  We know little about them.  They are a great addition to the movie, and some of them provide excellent comic relief, but I felt the audience should know a little more about them.That problem is nothing compared to the sheer brilliance of this movie.  It kept me intrigued the entire time, as the actual theft began no less than halfway through the movie.I was extremely impressed by Ocean\\'s Eleven.  I can recommend it to anybody, as it has no nudity or extreme violence.  The language gets a little harsh at some points, but overall it\\'s a decent movie.  The actual idea of thievery is underscored by a deeper purpose which attempts to send a clear message that thievery is still not right.  Morals, although masked, are still present in this exceptional movie.\"', '\"If Tom Cruise can really climb freestyle up a rock face and live to tell the tale, then I want to know how he does that and about twenty other crazy features this movie has to offer. Yes Mission: Impossible is back for a second round and features ridiculous stunts, a kind of storyline more suited to James Bond in the 60\\'s and Tom Cruise going absolutely crazy with the fighting. I didn\\'t like this film and although far from hating it, the movie didn\\'t give me much reason to like it at all, with silly things added in here and there as well, well let\\'s go over it shall we.First off you have the stunts, done well and the only thing I will fully remember from this movie but also that this has long droughts without any action and then suddenly has too much. Tom Cruise comes back in the same style he has in the first instalment boasting some over the top fight sequences and also longer hair. The story is for me in certain scenes a little too convoluted, now the entire story as a whole isn\\'t but parts are, they defy logic at certain times and some moments are not well explained and really try too hard to draw you in to a plot I just couldn\\'t invest in.Now what to say about good old John Woo, well to put it in simple terms I really did not enjoy his directing. His style is so insane it just makes normal scenes turn into a crazed stand off and then don\\'t even get me started on the pacing. I can\\'t really say he directs the actors well either and although the cast are fine and all that, his direction can make some scenes just a little dumb and yet again confusing and repetitive. Robert Towne is a legend of screen writing but my word does it look like he has lost it here, I\\'m not saying this is a career ruin for him not by a long shot but Towne could have done so much better and written something memorable, not just some generic stuff. Staying behind the camera well on the camera maybe is the cinematography which is done well, I liked the nice sweeping shots and angles which change the scene completely, wasn\\'t too sure on the close ups of the face but in general some good stuff. I think if you\\'re going to make a spy film at least put the action in and spread it out, here it is all concentrated in the same place and so it becomes boring after a while, even with the insane stunts. I think we should have seen more of the suspense that at times the first movie brought to the table, too often in this Cruise or should I say Ethan Hunt just does things at a fast pace with no thrill to it. A better villain as well for me would have been better, sure Dougray Scott and his henchmen could be bad but that true terror I did not see, a poor casting choice all round and should have been easier to absolutely hate. This film isn\\'t all bad I admit it has it\\'s moments of genius actually and although I think Cruise is not great in this or the first Mission: Impossible, I can\\'t deny he has a lot of spy style. If you liked the first movie then you should have no problems liking this one too, the stunts and the action are enough I felt to satisfy MI fans. For anyone else please be directed to take your brain out before viewing this, it is popcorn movie stuff and I don\\'t think the plot is smart. So overall I do feel this is poor and not really an addition I think Cruise deserves to have in his film catalogue, he is not good here, not bad but not good and I think spy films do not gain anything extra from having this among their ranks.\"', '\"I was disappointed in this second endeavor.  Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith lacked the chemistry that made MIB such an excellent movie.  I thought the acting was a bit stiff and the jokes were kind of cheesy.  I was still entertained, however I was hoping for a lot more.\"', '\"Die Another Day is beyond doubt the nadir of the Bond franchise; the film is wracked with a paper thin plot, insipid dialogue, and a palsied directorial hand.  The writers, producers, director, editors, et al seem to think that they can pawn off a Mission Impossible style spy flick as a genuine 007, yet they have only succeeded in making a Bond worse than On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service - - in fact, the only film in any franchise which immediately comes to mind for comparison is Batman Forever which sank the Caped Crusader quicker than Robin could say \"Holy Torpedo.\"  Let\\'s hope that those involved with this abomination will remember a few simple rules the next time through.  First, with maybe two exceptions, any movie that features Madonna, even in a cameo role obviously added on to glorify her titanic ego, is bound to fail.  Second, lines of dialogue like \"Take that, b****\" could be improved with the slightest effort from any gin-addled bum passed out on the sidewalk before the studio.  Third, an Oscar-winning performance by a fine actress does not guarantee sterling acting when said actress is a Bond girl; Halle Berry was worse than Tea Leoni in Bad Boyz when half the theater audience I viewed the film with began shouting \"Exposition! Exposition!\" Fourth, when Bond villains spend less than a minute explaining how their Doomsday device will work, the brevity of their speech is due to the utter outlandishness of the writer\\'s stupid idea and due to the fact that the writers could not work out this clap-trap even in their own shallow minds. Finally, cut out all the \"action direction\" which relies on rapid cuts, sudden and unnecessary zooms, and inexplicable jerky use of slow motion; Bond films have never needed to rely on such pedestrian tricks to wow viewers before.  We don\\'t want a video game on screen - - we want Bond.\"', '\"Well, the ending was exciting. That was about the only thing a person can say about the otherwise dull \"Mission: Impossible 2.\" John Woo does an admirable job, and Tom Cruise does a good job with his new set of martial arts moves, but otherwise this is a rather vapid film. In comparison to the original, which had far too much plot, this time around there\\'s far too little.At no point in this film is there any sense of mystery, of deception. It\\'s straight-forward, bubble-gum entertainment, wrapped around a marketable star and a director who really only gets to show his stuff in the last third of the film.The movie also suffers from a dreadful lack of character development, with Ving Rhames being woefully underused. Similarly, the Australian pilot who\\'s also part of Ethan\\'s team is introduced and then... well, he faded so fast from the plot that I can\\'t even remember the character\\'s name.The action towards the end is quite entertaining, but it\\'s too contained at the end of the film. It almost manages to save this movie... but not quite. \"Gladiator\" still reigns as the top summer action movie, at least until \"The Patriot\" and \"X-Men\" show up in July. \"M:I-2\\'s\" biggest highlight is the soundtrack, and that\\'s not saying too much. Go see it for a matinee, but skip the full price.\"', '\"Deservedly derided on release, The Sum of All Fears continues to hold a heady place in the worst-movies-ever league.It\\'s not only a mess, but a repugnant mess, as ludicrous as it is loathsome in its pandering to that section of the audience which belongs to the moronic tendency, one which only wakes up to death-as-reality rather than death-as-entertainment when confronted by events like 9/11 and which hasn\\'t a clue about politics, history, geography, or much of anything else.Like the execrable Die Hard II, which for narrative purposes dispensed with several hundred lives in the destruction of a 747 Â– Lockerbie, anyone? Â– Sum of All Fears goes in for mass murder Â– but then, like Die Hard, fudges it. It\\'s just a fiction, folks. Entertainment, right? We didn\\'t really mean it.And no, of course they didn\\'t. It would be difficult, putting it mildly, to have any serious intent when dramatising anything from Tom Clancy\\'s latter-day output: source material bearing only an accidental approximation to the English language makes life hell for those lumbered with the task of turning it into a screenplay.With Paul Atanassio in the writing credits, however, more, much more, might reasonably have been expected. But neither he nor anyone else involved delivers, well. . . anything.Narratively, it\\'s a string of clichÃ©s that aren\\'t even pulled together: neo-Nazis (oh Gawd, spare us, do) with a nuclear bomb (heigh-ho) and somewhere, some rogue Russian general who blows up the most unprepared aircraft carrier in the history of warfare after the Nazis have blown up, er, Baltimore.Not that anyone notices that Baltimore is the new Nagasaki. People merrily wander around Ground Zero without thought or effect of radioactive fall-out. The biggest danger appears to be fire engines driven by Keystone Cops.Tackling the neo-Nazis is an actor who achieves the not inconsiderable feat of registering even less on the radar than a stealth bomber. He, whatever his name is, escapes Baltimore in much the same way that his presence escapes the entire movie.Morgan Freeman is somewhere in there too, but it\\'s a phoned-in performance -- as is that of Alan Bates, who on reflection may afterwards have thought himself fortunate to have worn so much make-up.The US military is there in support as well, thereby proving to the rest of the world how utterly illiterate it truly is -- else how come it signed up to a script which shows it to be so blindingly maladroit? (If there\\'s such a thing as reincarnation, God, please don\\'t bring me back as a midshipman on a US aircraft carrier. . .) James Cromwell turns up too, seemingly in confirmation that either he or his agent can\\'t read, either: the tastelessness of \"The General\\'s Daughter\" ought to have been enough for one career but no, here he is again. Curious, how far the farmer has travelled from the happy days of \\'Babe\\'.But perhaps that\\'s the explanation. Somebody said of \"The Sum of All Fears\" that it\\'s a real pig of a script.So he thought he was in another sequel.Rating: doesn\\'t even register.\"', '\"I went in wanting to see this movie, and it delivered on everything I had hoped for.  It did have a reasonable plot, and what it was lacking for in plot it made up for in character development.  It had style and great actions scenes.  The story never got boring, and I stayed interested until the end.  I am sure that eveyone leaving the theater with me wanted to burn rubber as they drove home. (The difference being, I can, in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd!) What is lacking in this movie is any intelligent explanation of the science behind the speed.  Throughout the movie we learn 2 things.  1, nitrous makes a car go faster, and 2, you have to press the button at the right time.  I dont think I ever heard anyone in this movie mention the size of the engine for any of the cars raced.  Diesel, who again does a great job - contrary to those who assume big muscles mean no brains and automatically pan him - does give a top to bottom on his father\\'s car, but it is never raced.  I guess we have to assume these are basically japanese compact cars that are painted nicely and mod\\'d out to the max, and that\\'s the only reason they come close to matching the speed and power of classic street-rods. Still, I really would have liked there to have been more explanations of why Car A is faster than Car B, and known why Car B\\'s driver needs to use his wits to win. Of course, the writers must have known, it doesnt really matter.\"', '\"21st of 23 Bond movies (20th of 22 official Bond movies) Pierce Brosnan exits his role as Bond in by far the greatest farewell of any of the long term actors in the role. I\\'m probably being harsh giving this movie 9/10 instead of 10/10...but if I give it the same score as my next favourite Bond movies (\"On her majesty\\'s secret service\" and \"For your eyes only\"), then I can give differing reasons as to which one can be considered the best. Character wise, George Lazenby\\'s movie is easily the best. Entertainment wise, Brosnan\\'s final outing is in the same league as Roger Moore\\'s \"For your eyes only\"...if I\\'d scored that Moore movie when I saw it, it would have undoubtedly been a 10/10 movie for me. I was a child when I saw it, and the excitement of it wasn\\'t as intense having recently seen it as an adult...albeit on the small screen at home. Hence the 9/10 I gave it.In many ways this movie is the essence of certain Bond elements instantiated. Some elements of the story will be familiar to followers of the franchise. These are brought to life in a way never before possible, due to a big budget and improvements in special effects. For instance, it homages and surpasses a certain scene in \"Goldfinger\" involving a laser.Exotic locations: North Korea, Hong Kong, Cuba and Iceland.Plot: Bond\\'s mission in North Korea is compromised by a mole, presumably, and his status as top spy is made to look compromised. His licence to kill is revoked and he goes rogue to find the person who gave him up in North Korea and then made it look like he had given away secrets to his adversary.Franchise clichÃ©s: Pre-title sequence - Gun barrel sequence has a funkier beat this time, but the iconic bass line returns in a big way. A new element is the bullet which flys right at you to end that sequence. If you\\'re wondering if there is anything that Bond can\\'t do, you\\'ll have to scratch \"surfing\" from your list of candidates! Brosnan does a bit of a Jack Nicholson impersonation in once scene (with the sunglasses scene) before his mission goes pear shaped when he is with Colonel Tan-Sun Moon. The colonel is dealing with blood diamonds (I think that they\\'re called \"African conflict diamonds\" in this movie, though in a more recent movie they are called \"Blood diamonds\"...that could even be the name of the movie).Theme song - By Madonna. It\\'s auto-tuned, and she sounds like a little girl as a result. Has a techno feel, mixed with symphonic elements like violins. Not a bad song. For the first time in a Bond movie the theme song and action proper bleed into each other. Some credits are faint as a result. The end credits have a remix of this song...called the \"Dirty Vegas mix\". The song writing credit is attributed to Madonna and someone called Mirwais AhmadzaÃ¯. The conventional visual style for the song is perhaps the best in the franchise...good use of computer generated images. For the first time, I think, an existing song is used in the movie and given an end credit...in this case The Clash\\'s \"London calling\".Q - The transition to a new Q is completed...John Cleese plays the new Q. Some more background info is given on this role...Bond calls him \"Quartermaster\" initially, which Wikipedia states is a role in the British army concerned with provisioning supplies and provisions. Later Bond calls him \"Q\", thus cementing the name to the role, not the individual. For once, Q actually has a good line in the series...the exception to the rule is the one and only hilarious thing he had said prior to this movie...his final line in \"Moonraker\", which is an all time great Bond movie zinger. Q also has the most astonishing equipment he has ever given to Bond in this movie...a car. It seems that some Bond movie fans hate this movie based on that car...it crosses some sort of line for them. Since I\\'ve recently seen a documentary which makes this technology seem plausible in theory, I did not have the same issues with it as others.M - Has some lines which give insight into her position and relationship with Bond, like \"If I had my way, you\\'d still be in North Korea. Your freedom came at too high a price\".Moneypenny - Over the course of the franchise, her relationship with Bond has been rather vacuous. The exception to that rule was her great story in \"On her majesty\\'s secret service\". The new actress playing the part in Brosnan\\'s movie has been better served by the script. In some ways this is a nice bookend to \"On her majesty\\'s secret service\"...showing you how she handled the fall out from that previous movie. I\\'m a bit ambivalent about her final scene...it ties in with the earlier movie, but it is rather melodramatic...some fans could actively loathe it. At worst it is a misjudgement by the writers.Silly female character names - Peaceful Fountains of Desire. That\\'s her name. Seriously. There\\'s also a character with the nickname \"Jinx\"...so, not a real name.Sexism/misogyny - Nothing in my notes on this. Feminism has caught up to Brosnan\\'s Bond...left Connery and Moore untouched though.Wine buffery - Bond says \"\\'61 Bollinger\" and \"Vodka martini. Plenty of ice, if you can spare it\".End teaser - James Bond will return.Things to watch for:*MI6 having an evaluation centre in the Falklands!* Bond has cyanide from MI6...a suicide pill standard for all 00s, presumably.* The longest pause between \"Bond\" and \"James Bond\" when Bond introduces himself. I mean in the franchise...I\\'m guessing.\"', '\"It\\'s definitely style over substance. And John Woo is either in love with himself, or hasn\\'t learned any new tricks in the last 3 decades.\\nThis is because the movie practically screams \"John Woo! Look how massively John Woo this is! Hey, remember how the same things are shown in the same way in every John Woo film!? Us too, so let\\'s do every one of them! John Woo!!!\".\\nIt looked stupid, and out of date, and the John Woo stuff has been so done to death it feels like a cliche of a parody of a cliche. It also made it feel fake, so a suspension of disbelief is not really available.\"', '\"With the recent release of Charlie\\'s Angels (2019), whichi didn\\'t love, it felt like it was time to go revisit the 2000 film. I\\'m glad I did too, because my memory of this really wasn\\'t doing me any favors.Right up front, it\\'s so obvious that this was filmed by a guy, which is so not a good thing. The Angels are stereotypes, they\\'re constantly oversexualized and regularly focus on they\\'re relationships with men, not to mention an odd sense of fawning over the disembodied voice of Charlie as well as Murray\\'s Bosley. With a contemporary perspective on gender equality and feminism and all our modern political correctness... Oof. This fails hard at that. That said, the ladies are strong and capable on their own, it\\'s just hard to take that serious when they\\'re constantly presented as sexual objects.That\\'s the main negative of this movie to me, but take that away and this is an energetic, action and comedy packed extravaganza in that crazy late \\'90s early 2000s style of craziness. The actors all seem to be having a lot of fun with it, the story makes sense and I always enjoy Rockwell.I try not to hold modern standards against older movies as strongly but it\\'s so all over this one that I can\\'t help but heavily knock it down for that. Still, it\\'s a fun, mindless watch if you get the chance.\"', '\"I saw this movie because I loved the original, and the idea that one of my favorite directers John Woo was directing it. During the movie I came to the conclusion that some people would not like this movie because of the use of slow-motion(which happens a lot).  However, I like the slow-motion technique John Woo uses, without it the movie would be to quick to really admire.  I also liked Tom Cruise in the movie although the long hair doesn\\'t fit him as well as the short cut like in the original.  The supporting characters were I admit, overshadowed and never really used, especially the helicopter pilot.  Scoot plays a great villain even if he doesn\\'t have the look that Gary Oldman or even an asian actor like Chow Yun Fat could have brought to the part but you wouldn\\'t believe they would double as Tom Cruise.  All in all I thought the film was great, probably a little less plot heavy then the original but at least the MI:2 series is doing what the Bond series never understood, changing directers to add a new perspective and new film style so the formula never gets tired.\"', '\"Tom Cruise and John Woo deliver on their promise to bring you Mission Impossible with Kick (or, kicks, shootouts, sliding shootouts, sliding car chases, high cliffs, sweaty palms, and tight editing)!  Like a gift to all us Gen X\\'ers and the Baby Boomers who grew up with the original Mission Impossible -- this is the way it was meant to be.  The first one pales in comparison.\"', '\"Rather than echo the sentiments of the other commentors about \"the usual Jackie Chan humor and action,\" I\\'d like to say that the elements that stood out as different from earlier Chan films had to do with the humor being more broadly spread throughout the cast, and the several humorous undercurrents in the film. These, combined with Jackie\\'s now-familiar low-impact violence, good-natured humor, and a quite engaging story made it one of the more enjoyable experiences at the theater in a while.In many ways, this film\\'s spirit reminded me as much of \"Cat Ballou\" as previous Jackie Chan flicks. Humor, yes, but more oddball humor.\"', '\"Ok.  I am an avid James Bond fan.  Hell, I\\'ve even read the original books. So it saddens me to say this Bond movie may just be the absolute worst in the history of the series. Without giving much of the movie away, their were some good points, so I\\'ll start with those.  The opening pre-title sequence was good, as was the acting of Bond himself.  M and Q were very believable.  As was Samantha Bond as the infamous Monneypenny.  Roseamund Pike as Frost was delightful. Now for the bad. The \"bullet-time\" effect (the same slow motion used in The Matrix) is a nice technique, but it was WAY over used.  So overused I got a headache from it!  The film had NO plot.  None at all.  It reminded me as if someone took part of other bond movies (Diamonds are Forever, The Man with the Golden Gun, etc...) tossed them together and said, \"Hey, we can make a movie here!\" In short, it was bad.Halle Berry\\'s character of Jinx was unbelievable.  I actually found myself hoping her character would die.  The film had almost no slow points..it moved from one action scene to another without room for a breath.  It seemed as if someone at the MGM Q-branch decided to use every single technical idea that they could figure out.  Plus, the ending was so lack luster I was disappointed.  Save your money, rent it on video, and in the meantime, go check out Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, or The World is Not Enough. Out of 5*:  **1/2 Out of a 10 Point Scale: 3\"', '\"This movie is packed with humor and action. Although it may seem kind of short, it has some good shoot \\'em up action. It features the old Shaft playing Samuel L. Jackson\\'s Uncle, and I can\\'t think of anyone better to play the role of Shaft than Jackson.\"', '\"\"Mission:Impossible 2\" has John Woo written all over it; along with \"Face/Off\" and James Bond\\'s \"Goldeneye\".  The plot is non-existent, and at many times unpalatable.  The money that funded this film was spent on the director, the actors, and the stunts; very little found it\\'s way into the screenwriters\\' pockets. If you are looking for great stunts, and beautiful cinematography, \"MI:2\" is worth the money, but if you\\'re after plot that takes a little thinking to follow -- stay home and rent the first one.\"', '\"While the trailers and commercials for this movie made it look really good, this movie itself is a POS that is openly racist against white people and the plot itself is nothing more than African American revenge. Samuel L. Jackson\\'s worst role ever. 1) The villain is a loser white guy who everybody, throughout the entire movie, hates and pushes around, be it the common drunk in the bar, his dad or his partner in crime. In one scene, a black man enters the bar (with a bunch of white chick sycophants no less) and everybody cheers for him. Then our villain white guy makes some vague racist comment and everybody, I mean, every single one in the bar, boos him and try to sooth the black guy whos been insulted. Nothing wrong with that but that way its been portrayed in the movie is so un-subtle, so explicit and is ridiculously intentional. Then the black guy approaches the white guy, almost as if hes gonna beat him up, instead makes two holes in a napkin and puts it on the white guys head as in KKK! YuK YuK YuK. Then everybody, I mean, everybody, once again starts laughing so hard and cheering for our black hero for his oh so innovative come back at the white racist. The white villain is so humiliated that he kills the black guy and absconds.2) Shaft beats up the villain\\'s white ass and takes him to court. Bad guy uses influence to get bail. Everybody, I mean, every single freaking one who can be seen, cries and boos in disappointment. Shaft resigns by embarrassingly throwing his badge at the judge.3) The rest of the plot is about Shaft trying to locate an eyewitness, brotha style, beating up white boys along the way.4) The white guy is shot in the end by the black martyr\\'s mom. More attempts at drama gone bad.I\\'m not even white myself but this movie is so explicitly racist that anyone of any race would find it an utter embarrassment to watch. All the drama of blaxploitation is so fake and so insincere that it makes me want to puke. There are no redeeming qualities about this movie too. The action sucks and the dialogue, trying to be badass, is utterly embarrassing. One of the worst movies ever made.0/10 stars.\"', '\"This was a great summer movie. I laugh at all of the negative comments about the silly plot. One look at the preview should be enough for those people to know to stay away.Vin did a great job, as he always does. And those cars, talk about cool. People who complain that they use crappy import cars should realize that these are the cars that the real kids (many of whom were in the movie) that race use.Stop your whinning, go rent Citizen Kain and leave the driving to Vin.\"', '\"Bond\\'s new car is \\'Da Bomb\\', with it having one excellent new gadget which for the very first time; actually seems to impress 007. There are 4 or so excellent plot twists , and are totally unexpected plus there are some great comedy moments in it. Although its a little more far fetched than the usual bond and with a hint more sci-fi than usual , its not into the realm of glowing colour screens built into everything (ala Mission impossible 2) , but it does seem to get close to it. Truly a brilliant bond film.......except for that horrible theme tune!\"', '\"This movie felt like it could have been much more than it was. It is not a big disappointment, but just another summer movie. Special effects were standard, plot was nothing different or new. Some funny parts already revealed in the advertisements. The aliens were unique looking, but nothing was really done creatively with them. It will be a hit on video.\"', '\"This movie was girl power at its best. This movie begins with three girls doing different things in life before being becoming active as charlie\\'s angels. All these ladies have different ideas and different will power to fight crime. They work for a guy named Bosley who tries to help the government but the only thing is they do not see him only take orders from him off a radio. This story gets interesting when the girls have to solve a crime which is very secretive and the girls use their different powers to get things done but the closer they get the unusual things began getting worse, can the girls do it. I enjoyed it due to all the action the girls had.\"', '\"The original MIB was fresh, funny, and exceptionally original. This lazy follow-up to the 1997 blockbuster tries so hard to repeat the feel of the first film that the creators seem to have thrown all originality out the window. Part one was full of surprises in each scene, and the chemistry between Jones and Smith was electric. Now it feels like all of the same jokes once more and the two leads sleepwalk for the entirety of the 80 or so minutes run time. Maybe they feel that they\\'ve done it all before? The villains are totally forgettable, and the talking pug Frank (while entertaining for a scene in MIB1) wears thin after a few moments of screen time. Elfman\\'s fun score is merely rehashed and uninspired. The only truly amusing scene had to be the cameo with Barry Sonnenfeld himself (which I won\\'t spoil).MIB2 isn\\'t a terrible film, but is not a good one either. This is all so unfortunate, as the premise of the MIB has so much potential for a long running franchise. Assuming that a MIB3 is in the future, hopefully the screenwriters will dream up something original and fresh once more. In the meantime, if you\\'re looking for a good Sci-Fi comedy pick up the original or the excellent Galaxy Quest.\"', '\"I liked the first MI film, but this shoddy, thoughtless sequel bears no resemblance to that movie. The characters here have no depth and no motivation; puppets of the plot, they traipse around meaninglessly blowing stuff up and staring at the camera with great intensity. The plot is boring and hackneyed and no one thought to give the villain any motivation at all. The pacing is monotonously slow -- it takes forever to get through even the supposedly fast-paced action sequences -- and director Woo tries for artsy with the action but ends up with messy. To be avoided at all costs\"', '\"Some would love this movie, others wouldn\\'t but you can deny The Fast and The Furious started a trend which is still on going today. Never Street Racing has been so popular since this movie came out.The street races are beautifully done and care had been applied to get the audience feeling the power and the adrenaline the pilots must feel behind the wheel of those road beasts full of NOS. There is no need to say that this is the signature of the entire series. Whatever the plot is, there is always a street race going on and each one of them is masterfully shot and scripted. This series is first of all a tribute to the cars and the driving skills of their pilots.The other asset of this movie are Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. The first one is playing Dominic Torretto, all in muscle respected and regarded as the leader of the entire LA racing community. Like her sister Mia says, everyone is attracted and orbits around Dom. Paul Walker is Brian O\\'Conner a promising undercover cop tasked to bring down Torretto and his team. He is definitely cute, bold and has racing in his blood. This duo are bearing the movie on their shoulders. When one is missing it has not the same impact.\"', '\"A huge budget sequel to the dumb \"Bad Boys.\" I guess it was inevitable.I saw the HBO special on this movie and watch how Will Smith, Michael Bay, and Jerry Bruckheimer went on and on about how great this movie is. What was really happening was that Michael Bay and Will Smith were happy that they received a fat paycheck and Bruckheimer was happy that he will make another huge pile of money with the release.They said \"we finally got it perfect.\" Perfect? Perfectly over-blown trash maybe. There is not the slightest distant glimmer of anything that faintly resembles originality here. It is all one boring dull mindless clichÃ© after another until the viewer is literally ready to puke.The \"story\" starts with Will Smith, who is hot for Gabrielle Union who is Martin Lawrence\\'s sister which is a a cheesy love vs family problem that is addressed so poorly that it shouldn\\'t be there. And guess what? There is a twist! Gabrielle Union is an undercover cop working on what maybe the same case! Oh dear! We are also treated to a big loud car chase in which well over thirty vehicles are totaled along with the bad guys. But the good guys? They don\\'t even get hurt. Some cops manage to land in critical care, but after flipping over in a car going 80 mph straight into a massive fireball in the middle of the highway you\\'d be dead. Yes the T-1000 survived such a feat, but he is a futuristic robot.Moving right on from the pathetic story and horrible action is the humor. It is also dumb, clichÃ©, and overly vulgar. I mean are rat sex and junior high school level gay jokes something you\\'d expect to see in a movie not by John Waters? Types of humor have their placement in film, or as Michael Bay demonstrates so well, misplacement. Moving on we come to a sick excuse for a plot device. Towards the end our heroes got save Gabrielle Union who was kidnapped. They pack their service pistols and prepare to go to take on an entire drug cartel. But guess what? The police chief\\'s friends are in the CIA and they decide, out of the goodness of their heart, to help two hotshot loose cannon detectives! So now, with the help of a bunch of CIA commandos half of Cuba is blown up and everyone goes home safe. Preposterous on all counts.There are entertaining movies that follow this kind of preposterous formula. James Bond, for one. He is just as ridiculous as this movie, but he has a light side. He doesn\\'t take himself too seriously. Those films have a tongue in cheek nature that constantly reminds us that we are watching what is basically a fairy tale. Not here. This film takes it self so seriously and tries to be ultra cool and slick. Thankfully it fails on all fronts of film making. Let\\'s hope we don\\'t see anything like it anytime soon.Sick, disgusting, unoriginal, a horrible waste of money, superficial, unentertaining, unfunny, vulgar, and just plain terrible. This sort of Hollywood junk put the word \\'bad\\' in the dictionary. Either that or the Bubonic Plague. Well, I guess they are both bad. 1/10 Rated R: excessive violence, relentless profanity, and all around bad taste\"', '\"Not a bad movie in spite of George Clooney\\'s performance. The rest of the cast made up for it. George just isn\\'t a good actor! This movie improves the one that was made in 1960, Staring Frank, Dean and the boys!  This addition has a much better ending!\"', '\"OK the action and the girls make it easier to watch, help to make it mainstream. And being Shaft, that the premise. But what does it mean? The lesson here? Don\\'t mess with Samuel Jackson. OK. When he buffaloes a drug dealer, beats the sh*t out him and screams whats my name *******? Do you wanna see me again? Well, thats and effective way to make an point. Violence used at its best. The political point of making an outlawish pursuit of punishment to a racist stupid yuppie, that goes out free in a hypocritical society and soldout judges, police corruption and the everyday racism that there are still people who try to justify that, law abiding citizens or to put it in shaft clear words \"nazis with a badge\"In this context that the movie was made, and that we STILL live in, white folks, and sometimes even black folks, intellectual or not, might miss what it means and mistake it for just any action with hot girls movie. In the American reality, to have a black superhero, that challenges corrupt judges, knocks off the police, beat the hell out of rich criminals, helps the community, and got a bunch of girlfriends; hey man, you got a role model.\"', '\"While the person I was sitting next to in this film classed it as far fetched, I couldn\\'t take my eyes away from the screen. Sydney has never looked better on film and not once was I offended by the portrayal of Australians like I often am in so many other films.Cruise was excellent in his return to the role of Ethan Hunt, in fact he improved on his first attempt. I preferred the sequel to the original which is very rare. He also managed to bring back some of that \\'Top Gun\\' charm that made us all love him back in 1986. I haven\\'t had the urge to gawk at Cruise since \\'Cocktail\\'.John Polson was a familiar and welcome face to see on the big screen and along with Ving Rhames provided excellent comic value to an already exciting film.If you\\'re not sure about seeing this film, I would certainly recommend it. It may be far fetched but when is an Action Film ever realistic and in my opinion Mission: Impossible should never be anything but.\"', '\"What can I say? Slow cars, bad acting, terrible music, and cheezy looking action scenes. First off, there is nothing \"fast\" or \"furious\" about a Honda or any of these tacky looking cars. The only decent cars in the movie are the Ferrari, F150 Lightnig, and the supercharged Charger. The day when an old $3k RX7 can beat a $140k V12 Ferrari will be the day cows fly. The acting was terrible. It\\'s like watching a movie with robots. There is no character development and they are all about as lively as stones. The music is just terrible for an action movie and the actions scenes have absolutely nothing realistic about them. It is quite apparent that no one involved in the making of this film has ever been to or knows anything about drag racing or cars. Don\\'t waste your time with this movie if can help it.\"', '\"This bond has it all.  It is truly the most heroic Bond perhaps ever.   It has dropped the cynicism and fake realism.  Once Bond\\'s supervisor tells him \"you see things in black and white when the world is gray.  In this film Bond has his strongest ethics ever.Every thing about the film is great.  Halle Berry is fine too.  There is nothing feminist, not a single feminist line,  nor nothing politically correct about this film.  Halle is an action figure and you just have to love her because she also has integrity and is nice.There are a few great villains and great scenes.  If you got away from Bond see this one.  Bond is back.\"', '\"Who better to play John Shaft than the one and only Samuel L. Jackson? Unfortunately, Shaft is no Jules Winnfield and this sure isn\\'t anywhere nearly as interesting or well made as Pulp Fiction. While these two movies are completely different, I can\\'t help but compare between the two. Unfortunately Shaft just isn\\'t that good. The movie is cliched and full of stereotypes. The bad guys seem like they could be interesting, if they had more character and weren\\'t so unbelievably cheesy and stereotypical. With the exception of Shaft, of course, the good guys aren\\'t that much more entertaining. Still, Shaft has its good points. The plot doesn\\'t slow, the action is somewhat more realistic than most action movies and Shaft always gets the better of characters so seedy and low that you can\\'t help but hate them. I\\'d give Shaft a 6 out of 10; it\\'s a decent movie but nothing special.\"', '\"This is my favorite Bond movie because it\\'s awesome. It has stunning effects, plenty of great action and pretty girls. The special effects are amazing, there is this really cool bit where Bond (played by Pearce Brosnon) where he is on this sorta surfboard in the air floating over the water with parachutes in his hands, a cool car chase on the ice and a bit where he runs down a glass dome. His co-star is Halle Berry, a beautiful Bond girl named Jinx and a beautiful but very bad girl Miranda (played by Rosamund Pike. Judy Dench is back as M and John Cleese is back but now Q not R and is his usual fun self. MoneyPenny is still hopelessly in love with James her hero. I recommend you see this movie because you will love it.\"', '\"Not much to add to all the other comments, except that \"The Matrix\" appears to have dictated to action movie directors that people fighting each other in a scene need to execute flips/spins in excess of 720 degrees, in slow motion, before ever landing a punch or kick.  Are these fights or outtakes from the X-Games?I supposed the technique is de rigueur in the Kung Fu genre, and it was pretty funny in \"Big Trouble in Little China,\" but I hope this particular trend is otherwise short lived.  It makes the participant look cartoonish and stupid, not what you want from your \"Mission: Impossible\" hero.\"', '\"This one had a chance to vault among the top five or so of Bond films. All the key elements are there:  A defined and strong villain; a world-spanning and over-the-top plot set in motion by said villain; two lovely ladies that have something to offer besides cheesecake; and some worthy set pieces of the series.But it\\'s not quite enough to push it past such Bond entries as \\'Dr. No\\', \\'Goldfinger\\', and Brosnan\\'s best, \\'GoldenEye\\'.  Due to a script that relies all too much on double entendres and sexual innuendo, \\'Die Another Day\\' induces more groans than it does gasps.  Despite all his heroics, the most astounding thing about James Bond is that he can still win the girl with opening lines like, \\'Magnificent view,\\' while ogling the bikini-clad Halle Berry. Please. Give it a rest.\\'Die Another Day\\' tries things a little differently than previous Bond films, which is the good thing.  More vulnerability is given Bond, as the film starts with him being captured by North Korean soldiers and held captive for fourteen months, during which he endures torture and interrogation.  After he\\'s released in a trade for Korean terrorist Zao (Rick Yune), he\\'s essentially disavowed by MI6, left to fend for himself while he goes to catch the bad guys.  Without giving too much away, this film\\'s villain is one of the best-developed of them all.\\nIt\\'s a good setup, involving Korean army connections, genetic identity manipulation, diamond-smuggling, and an orbital satellite called Icarus. British playboy Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) is a match for Bond in style, panache and recklessness and is a good foil for 007.  Zao has a great look for a henchman with his diamond-studded scars.  Many of the action sequences work very well, particularly the fencing duel and the car chase through the ice palace.  And John Cleese as Q pops in for a quick scene and a few very funny one-liners.  Also thrown in for good measure are several throwbacks to classic Bond:  Berry\\' bikini shot (Dr. No), lasers as deadly weapons (Goldfinger), and Roger Moore\\'s old jetpack pops up.The framework is there; but the details kill the fun.  Berry\\'s Jinx never quite clicks with Bond as she\\'s working (and competing) with him.  Michael Madsen is tragically miscast as an American NSA bureaucrat.  The dialogue, as mentioned, is crass and silly - always going for the punchline without fail to the point of ridiculousness.  It\\'s a grating habit, and for a movie that seemed to want to try something a little different with the Bond franchise, disappointing.A good actioner, an excellent (though not  classic) Bond outing.  It could have been one of the very best, but fell a little short.\"', '\"This was an extremely boring movie...the last quarter of the film had some excitement to it, but it was not entertaining enought to justify the first three quarters of the movie. I was also incredibly bored by the performance (or lack thereof) of Thandie Newton. She was in the majority of the film but only had about 15 lines. I grew rapidly weary of her just standing there, not saying a word, supposedly looking breathtakingly beautiful and noble....give me a break. Save yourselves a few dollars and wait for it to appear on video as this movie was not worth the price of admission.\"', '\"Having thoroughly enjoyed the original film so much, maybe it was just my expectations were too high for this eventual sequel. Or maybe it simply is that bad. All the things that made Bad Boys an enjoyable, if not exactly a classic, film simply got lost as Michael Bay proceeded to prove that he is what I suspected all along: completely talentless.  Simple things like plot are simply forgotten as the film lurches from effects pastiche to effects pastiche, with increasing incredulity. Whilst the effects at least provide something nearly-worthwhile to watch, the whole film simply ends up being two hours of pure purgatory, like watching a bickering, married couple who don\\'t know when it is time to quit and get a divorce.  Avoidable on just about every level.\"', '\"I haven\\'t seen a movie this funny for a long time.  There aren\\'t ANY boring parts to this comedy/action flick!  With excellent sound-track, rich western sets, NO dubbing (Yes, it\\'s filmed in English), and no gory scenes, there is absolutely nothing in this film to turn movie-goers off. Shanghai Noon is now one of my favorites, and I recommend this film to everybody.\"', '\"as soon as i saw the previews i knew this movie would be good. and i was right it was. Before going though, i had read the book first and so it helped having  little background of the movie. George Clooney is the leading man but i think Brad Pitt\\'s performance was so much better. Very witty and believable. Danny Ocean (clooney) and his team of eleven including (pitt, damon) havethe one goal to knock over three casino\\'s in one night. They\\'re tactitcs are very clever and hard to imagine. Plus there is the \\'wild card\\' julia roberts who plays Danny\\'s ex-wife who is now dating clooney\\'s target, (garcia)./ THe twists and turns make this movie enjoyable and is so funny i laughed so much my friend told me she could hear across the seats! if ur going to see a movie this year, this is the one to watch!\"', '\"THE best of TFATF movies. As all first-movie-in-a-franchise movies are.This one was the pure adrenaline rush that is Rob Cohen, the director. The first movie of Rob\\'s that I saw was xXx and that was amazing! I loved that movie. Of course I mostly love all brainless high octane action flicks.But, there is something else about this film that makes me love it beyond my own comprehension. Maybe it\\'s the heart and the whole leave-no-man-behind theme that rocks around throughout this film, especially in the last half-hour.Most people only don\\'t like this movie because of it\\'s absence of a plot. I agree. There isn\\'t much of a plot here, and if there was, it\\'s all over the place.But who needs a plot in a movie that is meant to be just a movie to hold your attention. And that\\'s exactly what it does! 8 out of 10.\"', '\"I think I\\'ll reverse the normal structure and start with my conclusions before I describe the film. I\\'m a big fan of the original film, and from the previews I had hopes that this one might be better. Then I read Roger Ebert\\'s review of this film, where he gave it 1 1/2 stars, and I thought it might be awful.My experience was in between. This film is definitely *not* as good as the first film, and the previews contain most of the best bits, but it is often quite entertaining without ever really having any parts that I would call bad. I left the theater happier than when I entered. In contrast, both \"Spider-Man\" and \"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones\" had definite lame moments and disappointed me on the whole, and so I felt that a slightly higher rating was due to this film.Now, back to your regularly scheduled film description...The film opens with a clip from a television show hosted by Peter Graves. It has amazingly bad, Ed Wood level special effects, and it tells the story of the \"Light of Zartha.\" Even though this clip is mostly repeated later in the film, I can\\'t remember exactly how the story goes, which doesn\\'t speak well for the screenplay. In any case, we soon see a spaceship land in a scene very similar to one from the TV show. The alien inside, named Serleena, is made up of an innumerable set of tentacles, but it morphs into the form of Lara Flynn Boyle after seeing a Victoria\\'s Secret advertisement in a magazine.Meanwhile, Agent J (Will Smith) and his partner Agent T (Patrick Warburton) have to convince a very large alien worm-thing to stay in the part of the subway system where it\\'s supposed to be. Apparently J has had many partners since K (Tommy Lee Jones) left at the end of the first film, and soon he is again without a partner. He is assigned to a case of alien murder, initially partnered with Agent F (the talking dog from the first film, used much more extensively here). In the process he meets a waitress named Rita (Rosario Dawson), who witnessed the murder.The big thing that worked in the first film was the interaction between Smith and Jones, and it takes quite a while for the two of them to get back together here. As you probably recall, Agent K was neuralized (caused to forget his agent years) at the end of the previous film, so bringing him back takes some effort. But as you already know from the posters, K *does* come back and the old chemistry is still there, pretty much. But then again, I thought Agents T and F were pretty fun too, in their own ways.There are some parts and people that don\\'t work as well. Boyle is an interesting, which is to say wrong, choice to play the villain. The part was originally given to Famke Janssen, who would have probably been better. The special effects aren\\'t bad, exactly, but they do seem a little cheesy at times. What was original in 1997 is derivative five years later. But if you\\'re a fan of the first film, as I am, you\\'ll want to see this one.Animated short: The film was preceded by a cartoon titled \"The ChubbChubbs are Coming!,\" which is not listed on IMDb yet but does have an official site on the Sony Pictures web site. It\\'s not quite as good as \"For the Birds,\" which preceded \"Monsters, Inc.,\" but it is very funny, with references to \"Star Wars\" (Yoda and Jar Jar Binks), \"E.T.,\" and I\\'m sure others I\\'ve forgotten. Call it 3.5 stars.Seen on 7/3/2002.\"', '\"I actually paid good money to see this film at the cinema. To say I disliked this film really does not go far enough, I truly hated it. Normally I can find a positive out of a film and I like films of all genres, especially good action films.This film was surrounded with a lot of marketing hype at the time it was released in the UK about how it was a fantastic John Woo action movie packed with excitement. The \"action\" scenes were what disappointed me the most, they would have been laughable apart from the fact that this film took itself so seriously.Most of all this film was boring, boring, boring! Not what you want or expect from any action film. I can accept no plot and bad acting as long as there is some half-decent action in a film. This film was just dull and irritating with terrible action scenes (the motorbike chase scene is just stupid).I think this film must be Cruise\\'s worst hour, even if he tried to act worse I don\\'t think it would be possible. The more I think about this film the more I realise it was probably the worst film I have ever seen.I\\'m not being spiteful, I enjoyed Woo\\'s Face Off and I thought Cruise was good in The Last Samurai. I just don\\'t think they should ever team up to work on a film together ever again.\"', '\"I was tempted to check the \"Contains spoiler\" box before writing my comment, reason being that if you ever watched Alfred Hitchcock\\'s \"Notorious\", you have already watched this movie. Well, to be fair, there\\'s the face-switching and explosions and inferior acting to the previously mentioned masterpiece that make Mission: Impossible 2 a little different. I don\\'t know if any lawsuits were brought up during the release of this film, but they should\\'ve been for the cheapening of a Cary Grant classic. I would think that a sequel to such a \"notorious\" action film would have just a little more originality. Had the plot not have been already used, the score would be a 6/10. The action was a little fun, and the face-switching never gets old. But with the knowledge that this movie is a blatant rip-off, the experience is a little depressing. For those not into black-and-white oldies, sorry for ruining your fun.\"', '\"The Madonna theme, its god awful. The acting is par with the other Brosnan bonds. The story goes from fun, to none and back to a bit of fun at the end. The villain is coincided enough to make him unique, but not enough to make him have impact.\"', '\"This movie has much going for it. Awesome action sequences with high-flying explosions, high-speed chases, fascinating and beautifully choreographed martial art sequences, and excellent special effects all directed with flash and style.And what about those leading ladies?!?! All three (Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore) are so damn cute and appealing in their own unique way that you can\\'t help but like them. Lets not forget the equally wonderful performance by Bill Murray, one of America\\'s greatest comedians. This movie\\'s high production values are present throughout. It has wonderful costume and set design, better-than-average action sequences, directing, and special effects, and topped off with a winning and lovable cast....yes sir this movie has everything...well almost everything...WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE PLOT?! This movie is held together by the thinest of storyline. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous! The viewer is expected to takes huge leaps of faith and shut down all logical thinking as the mindless plot plods along to the next action sequence. All the film\\'s so-called \"twists\" can be seen miles away. The villain dialogue is so horribly cheesy, I can barely listen to it!FINAL RATING:  6/10 -  Maybe the studio should have spent at least some of the $92 million dollar budget on a decent script, and this movie could have been very excellent! As it is, it remains nice brainless fun that is best enjoyed with friends over a beer or two (or three)! Action-lovers will cherish it and casual movie fans of all genres will probably find something to like about it. Noob Aalox\"', '\"*May contain spoilers*From the opening gun barrel sequence, with the additional bullet flying towards the camera, I knew something was wrong with the 20th Bond outing. I thought it was strange that, to celebrate the 20th film and 40th year, the makers of Die Another Day created a film as far removed from the 19 predecessors as they could get.From the very start, the difference is noticeable. As Bond starts his mission by surfing into a Korean military base, the poor continuity of the waves is something that would never be seen in any other Bond film. Director Lee Tamahori made his name with \"Once Were Warriors\", but \"assured\" us that he could handle action with the mediocre \"The Edge\". He can\\'t, or at least not the kind of action we are used to in a Bond film. Much of the time it is hard to understand exactly what is happening in the action scenes. This is mainly down to the super-modern Matrix style camera work, or the often erratic editing, but you also get the feeling that Tamohori didn\\'t really film enough footage - with events not really having any noticeable cause. The pre-credits sequence is an example of this, where so much is happening at the same time, it is disorientating for the audience. Many of the people in my cinema spent the entire film muttering with confusion.\\nThe overall tone of the film is strikingly different too. I don\\'t want to go into the story too much, but certain scenes, such as the one where Bond induces cardiac arrest on himself is just....out of place. The whole film seems as though it has been made by a new set of producers who want to make something drastically different to something which was perfectly fine (and successful) as it was. The shots of the heart monitor imposed over Bond\\'s face seem more at home in an episode of Casualty or ER when the director has tried to be a bit too artistic.The biggest surprise came from the title credits. Most people criticise Madonna\\'s theme song, but i thought it fit in well with the rest of the film. Nothing really seemed out of place in this film - it was all a bit bizarre - just the film seemed out of place with the franchise. Anyway, the idea of having the actual story of Bond\\'s torture unfold over the credits was a bit strange and didn\\'t really work. Fair enough for trying to be different, it just looked a bit tacky. Some of the images were abit lame too - dancing scorpions? The funny thing is, my favourite Bond films are Roger Moore\\'s - those with the over the top camp humour. The fact that this film contained such scenes, and didn\\'t really acknowledge that it was a bit crappy, i think was it\\'s downfall.Now the script. Recently they have all been a little uninspired - I suppose there are only so many double entendres in the world that the script writers are finding it hard to find those which haven\\'t been used - but this did seem like it had been written by a 14 year old and in a rush at that - strange since this film took longer in production that usual (3 years instead of 2). The scene when Bond first meets Jinx, and all they do is look awkward and mutter \"innuendos\" at one another is embarrassing. Throughout the whole film, the jokes were extremly obvious and disappointing - sometimes not even innuendos at all but just smutty remarks. At the final scene where bond and Jinx are in bed together and we hear her asking him not to \"take it out\", by this time I actually expected it to be referring to his penis.The sad thing is, the film was crammed with imaginative ideas and concepts, with most of the characters providing an interesting premise, had they been further developed. Halle Berry as Jinx, I feel was over-rated and proves no more an equal to Bond as Anya Amasova or Holly Goodhead. Yes she is as witty as him (not hard in this film) and can hold a gun, but he still has to be rescued by Bond on a number of occasions and the whole female James Bond/rival spy thing is getting a bit boring. Miranda Frost was a nice idea for a character, but unfortunately Rosamund pike seemed to lack the experience - this being her first feature film - to pull it off, mistaking talking in a overly posh, private school accent for being icy and cool. Her fencing skills were never really demonstrated, except in a rushed and confusing fight at the end. Zao was a truely unique character, but the film had angered me so much by the time he was properly introduced, I hated the fact that a DNA expert could change his face but not remove a few diamonds. In any Bond film a certain amount of disbelief suspension is vital, however this film required so much mine was ready to break. Again, Gustav Graves was an interesting character and rather well played by Toby Stevens, however when his motives (which never become entirely clear) and identity are revealed, you\\'ll feel cheated and disappointed.The special effects. Before I saw the film, I was extremely disappointed to hear that many of the set pieces would involve CGI - as opposed to the Bond tradition of having actually carried out the stunts. The result was that many of the set pieces, which would have been perfectly enjoyable had they used stuntmen, models etc. looked overly fake and so lost all excitement. I know that James Bond isn\\'t real, but to reinforce that by creating him digitally takes way any belief that what is happening is at all dangerous. Scenes which in any other film, such as the technically superb car chase between Bond and Zao, lost any element of suspense because they looked so unrealistic, and by this time, I had seen so much over-the-top computer work, it was hard to be bowled over. The worst ever scene from any Bond film was the one where Bond uses a makeshift surfboard to escape a tidal wave. Pierce Brosnan\\'s stupid gurning face (which come to think of it is present in all his films) made me want to look away. He used the exact same expression whilst in bed with Jinx, and whilst being strangled on the chair in TWINE, and whilst being squeezed by Xenia in Goldeneye. I never thought that the actor playing Bond could be criticised, but in this film, Brosnan just seemed cocky and irritating. I did actually hope that he and Jinx WOULD go down together.There were some truely entertaining scenes, especially the sword fight between Gustav and Bond, also John Cleese\\'s Q was genuinely funny. Apart from that the film had a nasty sense of trying to appeal to too many people. I know Bond films are there to make money - of course, they always have been, it\\'s just that apart from teenage fans of xXx, I can\\'t really see who else it would appeal too. Certainly not traditional enough to please the die hard fans, yet too self referential to appeal to a non Bond familiar audience, let\\'s hope Barbara, Michael et al soon get over this horrible adolescent phase they\\'re going through and provide us with more of the Bond that we know and love.PLEASE NOTE THAT I AM A HUGE BOND FAN AND THIS IS THE FIRST THAT I HAVE DISLIKED IN ANY WAY.\"', '\"After seeing this movie on opening night back in 2000. I fell in love with all three of these leading ladies. They brought a sense of charm to their roles. It\\'s hard to pick a favorite out of the three. Cameron has a girl next door quality to her. Lucy is a force to be reckoned with but also cute and funny. Breaking away from the normal ice queen that we are used to. (I.e. her character on Ally McBeal). Drew brings a tomboy characterization to her role. She is the more rough and tumble one that I relate to the most. The movie starts out with them as the Angels already. They are a kick butt team of goofy secret agents. I say goofy but they take their job very seriously. For the most part. There is a lot of cliches here and some unrealistic disguises but it\\'s all in good fun. In real life spies are to blend in when these girls are designed to stand out. The action is from the post Matrix phase. Lots of slow motion high flying wire stunts. Which I enjoy still to this day. Again unrealistic but fun. I call this type of movie a bubble gum pop action movie with a killer soundtrack. It\\'s more fun if you turn your brain off at the door.\"', '\"Someone should not allow Drew Barrymore to buy any cool old series ever again. She totally ruined a cultural icon. I would have even enjoyed the old Angels reprising their roles (Hell, Tanya Roberts still looks great on \"That \\'70s Show\"). But this movie is not sure whether it\\'s a comedy, an action or a mystery and it fails to deliver on all counts. If it\\'s only for the women (Like the original was) how come there is so little nudity? There was more nudity on the Aaron Spelling tv show in the \\'70s!The only reason to see this movie is Crispin Glover. He\\'s at his best in a non-speaking but very cool role. Maybe I should have just watched it with the sound down. It probably would have been watchable then.\"', '\"As ever Jackie Chan mixes action and humour to great effect in this mix of cliches and cultural misunderstandings. Chon Wang as he is called is a Chinese imperial guard with his head in the clouds. When the princess he is in love with is spirited away to the States he is the last person they want to send after her but his tenacity and ability to adapt (all this means is that he can generally beat his way through any obstacle) give him the edge in rising to the occasion. Both helped and hindered by Owen, a rather hapless cowboy, who he encounters on the way. They team up to make as effective a partnership as ever hit the screen. This is one movie, though, where a great woman stands behind the two men, here in the guise of Wang\\'s wife despite his reluctance at being the groom...\"', '\"when one says bad boys, we all remember will smith and his $105, 000 porsche 911. when we say bad boys 2, we remember... not much at all actually.bad boys was a sleeper hit back in 1995, because it had solid amounts of dark humour, strong action and style. bad boys 2 delivers it in bucketloads, and its not necessarily better.in the first bad boys, everyone had something to prove. for bay, smith and lawrence, they all had to prove themselves in this movie. also the budget wasn\\'t very big, so the action was \\'condensed\\'. but in bad boys 2, there are no such issues. i loved bad boys, but i only kinda liked the sequel. so why?1. This is probably the biggest one. There is no core to bad boys 2. the original was set about will smith\\'s anger to catch the man who killed max. but there\\'s none of that in bad boys 2. the characters are basically just strolling through the story, even with the conflict between them.2. bad boys didn\\'t take itself seriously, except for a couple of scenes, and to its benefit. the light drama works because of will smith\\'s acting. the sequel tries to present a genuine conflict between marcus and mike, and also between marcus and his sister. the drama is too often hokey, because it is underdeveloped, and michael bay tries to get involved. face it, he cant do drama.3. The action. as i said before, the budget limited the amount of action in bad boys. so the action lasts only long enough to give us the adrenaline rush, and then the next scene comes in. in the sequel, the action is far more impressive, and a treat to watch, but it just keeps going for its own sake. the haitian house raid, for example, needn\\'t be so long. it shouldve been a minor setpiece, but instead its overblown.4. also sadly missing is bad boys\\' colour pallette. there were some greatly lit scenes in the original, and some crafty colors. think of the orange hue in its opening scene. with the exception of the haitian\\'s house and the opening bust, bad boys sadly lacks coloured light. it was one thing i was looking forward to in the movie, and i barely found it.now don\\'t get me wrong, i enjoyed bad boys 2 for the most part. the causeway chase in particular still has me drooling. the comedy is also usually very funny, but again it also tries a little too hard to impress. but there are some moments to be had.I think bay may have lost touch with his audience. He doesn\\'t seem concerned if there\\'s too much action, even for male teens. its almost like he made this film because he can, not to provide entertainment. consider the running time of 2.5 hrs. thats far too long for a popcorn movie, no matter the content. that\\'s my opinion and i hope I\\'m wrong.still, the movie works on some levels.ultimately, a mostly fun but deeply flawed popcorn blockbuster.5/10\"', '\"This awful kungfu-movie is no better than the crappy HongKong-kungfu-crap they made 30 years ago. Easy jokes, ridiculous story and a setting (19th century Wild West) that just doesn\\'t become Jackie Chan. This ultimate collection of cliches (yawn) is interrupted by several action scenes which are, as usual, the highlights of the film. However, most action scenes are hardly original and Chan only succeeds in impressing the viewer in one or two scenes. The real higlight of the film is ZZ Top\\'s La Grange. Forget this movie, or use the FF-button to watch the actions scenes.\"', '\"Yesterday I\\'ve seen the new movie about MIB with Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson. And I can say that 2019 MIB film is the worst of all movies. This was boring and not interesting, while MIB 2 made me laugh a lot more and enjoy way more than MIB International. Also, MIB 2 is much better, because it includes the original main cast. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones will always be the best MIB pair. They are irreplaceable and the first two movies about Men in Black will remain as my favorite out all of those movies which were released.\"', '\"Ocean\\'s Eleven had a really cool feeling to it- a cool cast, a cool premise, and it was based in Las Vegas - what more could you ask for?  George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon made it easy for me to keep my eyes on the screen (I would love any movie that had those three in it, no matter what the plot was).  One thing I didn\\'t notice until the second time I watched it was that Brad Pitt is always eating something in every scene!  Casey Affleck and Scott Caan were hilarious in their roles as the brothers from Utah - they reminded me of my brothers.  I was also impressed by both Elliott Gould\\'s and Carl Reiner\\'s performances in their roles.  It was a nice change to see Elliott Gould in a more intelligent role than the one he has on Friends.  Even though I hate to see Andy Garcia as a villain, I think he did an excellent job - his character was easy to hate.  I always enjoy Julia Roberts, however I was a bit disappointed by her awkward performance in this movie.  It seemed like she was just there to deliver lines - I don\\'t think she really got into the role.  Another thing - someone needs to teach her to walk like a lady!  That being said, I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I would give it 9.5/10\"', '\"When Princess Pei Pei is lured out of China\\'s Forbidden City and taken to America and held for ransom three top Imperial Guards are sent to retrieve her. Chon Wang, a less than top guard also asks to go as he blames himself for her kidnapping. Once in America their train is ambushed by gangsters led by Roy O\\'Bannon. As a result of this Chon ends up off the train and Roy separates from his gang. Inevitably Chon and Roy soon meet again and end up forming an unlikely alliance; even if Chon is motivated by trying to rescue the princess and Roy is keener to get his hands on the gold intended to pay her ransom. If they are to save her they will have to deal with her kidnapper, a former Imperial Guard, and a corrupt sheriff who is determined to kill them both.This East meets West comedy western is a lot of fun as it plays with classic Western and kung-fu tropes in an amusing way. Jackie Chan is a great lead as he is naturally funny and more than has the skills required for the action scenes. Owen Wilson offers fine support; he too is funny and makes his character likable. While not on screen anywhere near as much Lucy Liu impresses as the spirited princess. A film like this needs good villains and it has two in the form of Roger Yuan and Xander Berkeley. There is plenty of exciting action; none of it too strong though; it is usually more slapstick than violent. There are lots of laughs to be had; these are a good mix of visual gags as well as witty dialogue. Overall I\\'d say if you enjoy Westerns and want a good laugh you could do a lot worse than this.\"', '\"Move over, \"Spice World\"!  Your sacred and delicate spot in the psuedo-loyal hearts and minds of thirteen year-old girls everywhere has officially been handed over to another, eerily similar, batch of boob-flouting babes from Brain-Dead Land.  And, as usual, I\\'m sure the women\\'s movement in America could not be happier about it.\"', '\"This movie and Mission Impossible 2 was released in the same week. Of course I went and watch MI2, because of its actions and their part one was awesome and I thought it would be similar to the second one.  I was wrong, when you want to watch an action movie, you\\'re looking for Shanghai Noon! This movie has lots of actions, ya know Jackie Chan!  Also this movie use history\\'s fact and their fiction stories, all blended in perfect.  This is not a perfect movie, but fun to watch. I gave this 8/10.  Because I laughed and enjoyed the movie. That\\'s means it\\'s well balanced.  Not serious all of the time, it has some comedy and shocking parts.Matt Pho Dans\"', '\"This is one of my top ten films of all time.  It\\'s so beautifully constructed.  The fantastic sets, the relatively original stunt choreography, the light but entertaining plot and the delightful camp feel all contribute to extremely fun film.\"', '\"The remake of Ocean\\'s 11 is a tremendously entertaining movie. I personally find Brad Pitt and George Clooney to be among the most watchable actors working today, so I found the movie to be hugely appealing despite numerous plot holes, an almost nonstop barrage of clichÃ©s, a ridiculous ending, and Don Cheadle. Before I go on, I should mention that I think Cheadle is an immensely talented actor with some great performance\\'s under his belt, such as his work in Boogie Nights, Traffic, and A Lesson Before Dying (sure, he can\\'t pronounce Vladivostok, but it was still a great performance). The problem with his character here, probably the most controversial role of the entire movie, is that he was forced to take on this ridiculous accent, making him the Jar Jar Binks of Ocean\\'s 11. Pretty sad, but I hope it serves as a lesson for how dumb it is to have well known actors take on thick accents. It does nothing but call attention to itself and invite criticism for the actor\\'s ability to pull it off. And given the content of the discussion boards on the IMDb, Cheadle didn\\'t pull it off so well. That being said, the rest of the movie is enormously entertaining, even though Andy Garcia, who I have had an unjustifiable aversion to ever since Desperate Measures, turns his character of the ridiculously rich Terry Benedict, owner of three casinos in Las Vegas, into an almost cartoonish villain. George Clooney plays the title character Danny Ocean, recently released from prison where he had plenty of time to develop intricate plots for robbing three casinos simultaneously. The parole board asks him if he thinks he would ever return to a life of crime were he released, he smiles, gets released, and promptly returns to a life of crime. This is the kind of character that Clooney was born to play.Brad Pitt plays Ocean\\'s Second, the second man in charge and much of the pull behind getting this whole thing together. We get the usual montage of hilarious antics being committed by those that are to be sought to be among Ocean\\'s 11 (edited together on the same template used to introduce us to the colorful characters in Armageddon), each one fulfilling the need for another stereotype. In this way, the movie is pretty weak, but it is so entertaining to watch the robberies pulled off that it makes up for a lot of these shortcomings. Brad Pitt lends his massive presence to the film as Rusty, an old friend of Danny\\'s. Rusty is an interesting character, sort of a freelancer in Vegas, living his life in the casinos, obviously raking in comfortable amounts of cash from his less than legal endeavors, and willing only to dress in the highest of fashion. Strange, however, for a man to constantly wear such high priced clothing when he is ALWAYS eating. Matt Damon plays the part of the pickpocket, whose skills come into good use in the plot in ways which I will not reveal, Don Cheadle plays the demolitions expert, Bernie Mac gets a great role as a card dealer with a not so clean past, and Elliott Gould makes a huge turn from his character in American History X to play the part of a washed up con man, eager for revenge against Terry Benedict, who put him out of business.The idea is to rob the central safe that stores the cash for the three casinos in question. Supposedly this is the most ingenious and impenetrable vault ever created by mankind (as this is generally how it is described throughout the movie), which begs the question of why the blueprints for the vault are kept under the watchful eye of a cheaply rented night security guard. That\\'s like leaving the keys to Fort Knox in plain view outside the vault and protected by a thin pane of glass. (spoilers) Complicating matters, conveniently for the script, is the little factoid that Benedict is now dating Ocean\\'s ex-wife, who left him because he was involved in a life of crime. It\\'s interesting to see the movie take place in what is to me the familiar setting of Las Vegas, but it is not enough to distract attention from the disastrous romantic content of the movie.Not only does Tess (Roberts) come off as a stiff and exceedingly unpleasant woman, but she left Danny in the first place for being a criminal and landing himself in prison. Then he pulls off this astronomical heist, stealing millions and millions of dollars from her current love interest (as well as managing to get him to admit on camera that he cares more about money than he does about Tess), and THEN she wants him back. What, she didn\\'t want to be with him before because his criminal life landed him in prison, but now she wants him back because he\\'s GOOD at being a criminal? Please. Nevertheless, while the ending almost completely ruined the movie because it leaves such a bad aftertaste, the rest of the film is hugely entertaining, bad fake accents notwithstanding. There are lots of twists and turns, lots of people get what is coming to them, and as is to be expected from a movie starring Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts, the star power is substantial. It ends badly, but it\\'s great up to that point. It\\'s just too bad that the bad part is so near the end and therefore in the front of your mind at the end of the movie.\"', '\"Shaft is nicely put together but ultimately unsatisfying. Just another vigilante-out-for-justice flick with uninspired dialogue, tepid pacing, dull action sequences,a disgusting use of race baiting, and one of the worst endings ever. John Singleton\\'s new version of an old classic has the always cool, ultra-talented Samuel L. Jackson as a violent detective who is waging a war against anyone who does anything wrong to black people. Jackson is one of the best actors around and is especially good at playing bad motherf\\'ckers so it was a huge dissappointment that a character that he was born to play turned out to be a hypocrite with an indifference to white people and the centerpiece of this lousy film spewing lame lines and mowing down inept bad guys. Christian Bale gave the stand-out performance of the film(in my worthless opinion) as the primary villain, even though his role was a pretty bad stereotypical character. I felt sorry for his character by the end of the movie due to everything he had to go through. Enough has made about Jeffery Wright so I just say I liked his performance too. Vanessa Williams and Toni Collette were criminally under-used in thankless supported roles. But Buster Rhymes...I couldn\\'t stand him.I hated him in Higher Learning(another bad Singleton movie) and I hated him even more here and if I listened to his music I\\'d hate that too.He was such an idiot talking like, \"Whuuut chuuu tawwwkin bout daauwg?\" For once I\\'d like to see a movie like this where the race roles were reversed, but of course it would labeled as a racist. Anyway lots of people liked and it made money so I guess it accomplished what it set out to do. Hopefully the sequels will have good scripts, better action sequences(something beside quick cuts of Shaft and the bad guys taking turns shooting at each other) and eliminate the racial under-currents.One more thing: Racial tension is not a one-sided problem  anymore!It p***ed me off how almost all the characters who weren\\'t black were pompous bigots and the blacks were shown at heroes even if they were just as bad.\"', '\"Brian O\\'Connor is a Los Angeles police officer who is working undercover to discover the identity of a group involved in a series of truck hijackings. To this end he tries to get in with the street racing community. To do this he will not only need to take part in the races he will have to impress the other racers. His bosses are convinced that one Dominic Toretto is behind the crimes but as Brian gets to know him he becomes less sure and is soon convinced that a group of Chinese racers are the ones involvedÂ… is this really the case or of Brian becoming a bit too friendly with Toretto? He has also fallen for Toretto\\'s beautiful sister which leads to some friction with another one of the group who also has the hots for her.If you are looking for the \\'Citizen Kane\\' of action movies this isn\\'t it; however if you just want some good mindless fun with fast cars and a good looking cast you could do much worse. Early on I thought this would just be \\'Point Break\\' with street racers instead of surfersÂ… in many ways it is but there are as many differences as similarities. As one might expect there are a succession of action set pieces; this include several races, fights, shootings and a spectacular truck robbery that goes horribly wrong. These are pretty exciting even if they are a bit unrealistic at timesÂ… an example of this is the truck hijacking; it takes place on what appears to be a main road but we don\\'t see a single other vehicle for the entire sceneÂ… if you can ignore this sort of thing this shouldn\\'t detract from the film. The cast might not be Oscar contenders but the do a solid job. Overall this is a solid enough brain-in-neutral action film.\"', '\"MiB 2 isn\\'t as bad as other people say but it\\'s not that good either.CHARACTERS\\nI actually think that J is a better character in this movie than in the last movie.\\nFor the first they developed him so that he is a professional good agent in MiB 2 and they also made him more humane by making him not whipe the memory of Laura giving him a little development.\\nK isn\\'t as good though.\\nThey could have focused on developed the plot about K getting his memory whiped but they just made that a conflict and it got easily resolved.VILLAIN\\nThe villain is pretty boring.\\nShe has a basic motivation similar motivation for the Villain in MiB 2 but the difference is that the one in the first movie was actually funny but she is just pretty bland.COMEDY\\nThe comedy was lacklustre in this one.\\nA few repeated jokes a few new unfunny ones it didn\\'t make me laugh that much.VERDICT\\nI kinda get why people don\\'t like this movie.\\nIt\\'s similar to the first one and it has some holes in logic for example.\\n1. People saw an alien in the first scene of the movie but they didn\\'t memory whipped and even if they did it would be impossible for all of them to be memory whipped (they solved it later but even that\\'s stupid).\\n2. Why didn\\'t the citizen react scared to what was just happening.\\n3. They whipped agent T\\'s memory but isn\\'t that suit exclusive to MiB\\n4. How did James know how many people were in the subway is he some super genius cause he has done some stupid stuff.\\n5. The flushing system is stupid and it will make people pay attention and sceptical of what\\'s actually going on.\\n6. K got his memory back but he needed to know how to fight of the aliens even if he worked on MiB longer than J.\\n7. They didn\\'t care to solve the problem with big worm staying on the subway they just let him kill civilians.\\n8. If they whipe the whole cities memory won\\'t memory whipe some people from the MiB.\\nThat\\'s actually alot of holes in logic, you know what? MiB is pretty bad so I\\'ll give it a 4/10.\"', '\"In general, my three main motivations for watching Bond movies are the action, the women, and the plot.  _Die Another Day_ is sketchy on all three.I\\'ll start with the action.  Most of the action scenes are well animated and well done, particularly the one at the very beginning of the film.  However, it seems to go downhill from there.  The fencing scene is well done, but the rest -- the car chase near the end sin particular -- are predictable.The women are Jinx, a \"Cuban\" with a strong American accent, and Miranda Frost, assistant to the villain Gustav Graves.  Both are good looking in the tradition of Bond films.  However, Halle Berry\\'s acting talents are unfortunately hidden in the considerable shadow of her breasts.  The director makes an effort to make Jinx different from most of the previous Bond girls, more in the vein of Agent XXX from _The Spy Who Loved Me_.  Of course, she ends up foolishly going into the enemy\\'s lair repeatedly and needing Bond to save her every time.  She\\'s also far too easily seduced.  Frost, on the other hand, is far too one-dimensional to be interesting.  Excellent looks, as always, but a shallow character.Finally, we come to the plot.  The word that comes most readily to mind is \"contrived\".  It is unnecessarily intricate in the details, yet the general overview is far too simple to reach the standards of most of the Bond movies.  Frankly, I was disappointed at the end of the movie.  There were practically no twists at all, and from about the halfway point on it becomes more or less obvious what the plot is.  Once that happens, it travels in a predictable straight line, leading up to the happy ending with barely a deviation from the good-over-evil angle that is always pervasive in Bond movies, but never overwhelmingly so as in this one.There are also a couple minor details that weren\\'t done well either. Bond\\'s car has one neat trick, but other than that it seems run-of-the-mill -- and (TINY SPOILER) the other guy\\'s car can do all the same stuff Bond\\'s can!  The humor is just not there for the most part.  Berry tries hard and does a good job with what she\\'s given, as does Brosnan.  But the writing overcomes their best efforts.  (\"I got the thrust of it\" almost drove me out of the theater with its awfulness ...)  Moneypenny\\'s little scene near the end is funny, though it makes me feel bad laughing at her.So the final verdict is that _Die Another Day_ is a movie with potential at the beginning -- even the theme song and credits are good -- but goes downhill from there to become, in my book, one of the worst Bond movies ever created.\"', '\"Expectations were high for the 20th James Bond movie in 40 years. \"Die Another Day\", directed by New Zealand\\'s Lee Tamahori, is Pierce Brosnan\\'s fourth mission as 007 since 1995. This time, Bond is captured during an undercover job in North Korea, kept for 14 months in prison, tortured and finally left free as a beaten up, long-haired and bearded wreck. But of course Bond takes revenge and to follow his enemies, Korean Colonel Moon and the mysterious business man Gustav Graves, through Cuba, England and Iceland back to North Korea for the final confrontation.Halle Berry, the big star of the picture next to Brosnan, plays the American agent Jinx Jordan, a kind of female Felix Leiter. He role is not reduced to the former parts of the so-called \"Bond girls\", but plays a kind of \"Bond buddy\" and lover role at the same time. John Cleese plays the \"Q\" for the first time after a short introduction as Q\\'s assistance R. in the last movie and Desmond \"Q\" Llewelyn\\'s death in 1999. Samantha \"Moneypenny\" Bond and Judi \"M\" Dench are also back in action again.The rest of the cast is played by rather unknown, but superb young actors: Rick Yun\\'s Colonel Moon, with a face scratched by an impact of diamonds, plays the brutal henchman with a strong accent and with a bit more than just a supporting actor. Toby Stephen\\'s Gustav Graves is the perfect counterpart for Bond, an arrogant and greasy high society snob like a bad mirror image of 007 itself. Newcomer Rosamund Pike complete the triangle of death as witty, sexy and ice-cold Miranda Frost, an expert in sword fighting and great pretending.The story itself is quite simple, but decorated with lots of high-tech gadgets, computer-generated special effects, action scenes, car chases and fights. The high points this time are a hoovercraft chase across a mining field, a car chase across the eternal ice in Iceland, the big final in an airplane and - my favorite scene - a brilliant and hard-fought sword duel between Bond and Graves. The low point is the focus on too many special effects and science fiction elements (like Graves secret space weapon \"Icarus\" or an invisible Aston Martin as Bond\\'s car) that are bringing the new Bond movies from good post-cold-war-stories like \"Goldeneye\" back to the dumb high-tech-gadget-Disneyland of \"Moonraker\" with Bond in space. I hope they will concentrate on better scripts and less special effects for the next Bond movies!The trailer is great as ever with lots of action and explosion around, and for the first time the credits and title song are used as integrated part of the plot, showing scenes of Bond\\'s imprisonment and torture next to the well-known stylish visuals and girlie silhouettes.What else can be said? The settings are great as ever, with the bleak landscapes of Iceland, the tourist attractions of Cuba, Corea, Hong Kong and London town as locations for this adventure. There are some witty and funny dialogues, but David Arnold\\'s third Bond sound track lacks the style of his his former works as the score has some trouble to follow all the unusual hardcore action in this Bond flick. The title theme is sung by Madonna this time, a groovy electronica pop track that was rewarded by the producers with a small supporting role for the pop queen.As a funny bonus for the big bunch of Bond admirers there are many references to the long 007 movie history. Jinx Jordan\\'s first appearance is a funny copy of Ursula Andress\\' beach scene in \"Dr. No\" (1962). The Aston Martin is back in action again, and during a visit to Q\\'s laboratories, Bond faces the knife shoe of \"From Russia With Love\" and the portable rocket of \"Thunderball\". Moneypenny receives her first hot kiss from Bond in 40 years, but... well, check it out yourself! All in all, \"Die Another Day\" is a perfect anniversary for the James Bond series with great action scenes, but a little bit too much technology and science fiction all around.\"', '\"This movie was so horrifically bad that it is staggering. I had been satified (not blown away) with Mr. Brosnan\\'s previous outings as the british agent, 007. This film started promisingly. The idea of Bond being captured by a totalitarian nation and relentlessly tortured is a switch.\\nA disavowed Bond is a neat concept that we have seen twice before I believe in \"License to Kill\" and \"On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service\".\\nThat is the limit of this film\\'s quality. The villains are cardboard cut-outs. The acting by Halle Berry is laughably bad. She looks as if she has never held a gun in her life and yet is supposed to be a top spy? The gadgets are cute and there are some laughs in a scene with John Cleese as \"Q\". Brosnan expands the range of Bond with some actual acting, but it\\'s poorly timed and incongruent with the rest of the film. He loses his cool in ways Bond never would. Sean Connery would have had a witty/insulting line for his attractive co-agent even if she had double-crossed him. Instead Brosnan looks actually hurt or surprised! The Austin Powers series seems like an homage to Bond films of yore compared to this craptastic film. The situations Bond finds himself are stupid, his hoky ways of escaping them even worse. In this movie he isn\\'t a suave secret agent he is more a superhuman freak who despite his bumbling can foil the well-laid plans of his nemesis by virtue of the fact that the screenwriter can imagine a way out of each predicament. I would rather watch \"A View To a Kill\" with Roger Moore as a thick-midsectioned Bond and Chris Walken as a lame psychotic killer looking for a paycheck.\"', '\"the movie was great .....i wish de palma and woo could have gotten together to do this one....it would be great.... I think there was too much slow-mo, every punch had to be done in it. There was not enough thinking you had to do. They told you right out who did it, unlike the first one. I personally liked the first one better.\"', '\"It\\'s time for another Bond film, and this one has all that you\\'d expect as the latest in this long running series.  Halle Berry is absolutely gorgeous, of that there can be no doubt, and Bond\\'s MI6 colleague isn\\'t shabby either!Bond films are never going to be that intellectually challenging -- it\\'s not as if that\\'s why you see them, is it? -- and the other noticeable thing in this one is how much Brosnan is now starting to look his age.  Let\\'s hope he continues to age gracefully and is still around to make another one in 5 years time ... in 2-007.\"', '\"I just rented M:i 1 before going to see the sequel.  In a word, the test of a good movie is whether or not it is good after 5 years. M:i 1 was cheesy, super cheesy.  M:i-2 made it all worth it!!! I loved everything about M:i-2, sure it is not plausible, but it is extremely entertaining.  Exactly what you want from a summer action flick: great stunts and action, minimal corny jokes, and a plot line you can follow.  M:i-2 had all ingredients in abundance with a kick butt soundtrack and ear spliting sound effects. It\\'s all here in M:i-2, worth every dime.\"', '\"this is by far and away the WORST bond film of all, so bad in fact its actually damaged the memory of this long running franchise i think. Pierce Brosnans films were at least for the most part in some realm of believability, this utter tripe belongs to some bad b movie. GoldenEye to TWINE were at least well acted and executed! This is just tragic, bad acting (halle berry, please...) awful direction, bad (AWFUL) CGI. avoid at all costs and watch a classic, like Goldfinger!Bronsans Best to Worst:1. GoldenEye 2. The World is Not Enough 3. Tomorrow Never Dies 4. Die Another Day\"', '\"Warning - possible spoilers.I had declared Goldeneye to be the best of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films, and in terms of plot and character interplay it remains such, but Die Another Day runs a close second in terms of plot and action, and is superior in the overall SFX used.The film does suffer from the cheesy use of The Matrix-influenced computerized panning and turning as well as needless slo-mo shots (notably at the end in the confrontation between the main villain and another before Bond jumps into action). Such shots are a distraction, not an asset.It is the plot, though, that really gets the film going and leads to the lavish SFX finale. For almost the first time in the entire Bond series the villain makes sense because he is not some implausible rogue but an agent for an international predator state - in this case North Korea. The entire Bond series until now had foolishly shied away from this angle (other than SPECTRE\\'s employer in You Only Live Twice and Yaphet Kotto\\'s Kananga, leader of a small island state in Live And Let Die) and instead emphasized rogue business leaders, rogue generals, and the like. They could get away with it to a certain extent, especially with SPECTRE and what we now know about the extent of international terrorist networks, but by Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough the rogue angle had worn out its believability.Thus it is refreshing and adds new life to the series that the enemy is a predator state, not a rogue. Bond is betrayed and despite a spectacular chase captured and subjected to torture in North Korea, eventually freed in an exchange of prisoners. HMSS, though, has revoked Bond\\'s license to kill because they believe he revealed the names of agents under drug-induced interrogation during his capture, but Bond knows his betrayer was a Korean terrorist named Zhao, and he escapes and \"recruits\" a Chinese Intelligence officer to help him find Zhao. But as his investigation proceeds, he must learn about a mysterious and flamboyant British billionaire, Gustav Graves, whose specialty is harvesting diamonds, and whose main project is a spaceborne mirror that can project solar light and heat anywhere in the world, and when he presents evidence of a connection between Graves and Zhao, HMSS returns his license to kill, leading to the film\\'s best exchange, between Bond and the new head of HMSS\\' Quartermaster Branch within the branch\\'s new underground base, within which it stores \"all the old relics,\" a scene that deliberately evokes memories of the entire Bond series from James\\' trick briefcase from From Russia With Love to his Thunderball jetpack; also particularly visible are props from Octopussy, and it all closes with John Cleese\\'s evocation of Desmond Llywellen\\'s most famous line from the series as he presents James\\' new car.Bond eventually learns the truth about Graves\\' spaceborne mirror when it is changed to a laser cannon capable of destroying any object - arguably this is what Goldeneye should have been. Bond also learns the truth about Graves\\' love interest, Miranda Frost, who lives up to her surname well, all leading to the climatic showdown as Graves\\' laser cannon begins carving a relentless path of destruction on Earth.Now you may have noticed I have not mentioned the film\\'s much-hyped co-star - the reason is that Halle Berry\\'s Jinx Johnson serves no purpose in this film. She has a completely pointless fight scene against Miranda Frost that could have been cut entirely without disrupting anything in the film, and Berry\\'s presence ultimately slows the film down.Even so, you\\'ll want to Die Another Day with James Bond.\"', '\"Men in Black was a quirky, funny and inventive summer blockbuster a few years ago. It had an offbeat script and very engaging leads, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones made the first film memorable. Will Smith has an easy charm, Tommy Lee Jones plays a great straight man. Well now on to Men In Black II, we have the same stars, the same director, almost every person involved in the first one, and the sequel can\\'t even hold a candle to the first. Sequels are obviously commercially driven, most sequels are unnecessary money machines, but if they are done right they could be fun, audiences like to go back and see characters they like again. The problem with this movie is that even though it looks like the original, they forgot the element that made the first work, charm. The film has an aura of \"we did it only for the money\" about it. Even Will Smith seems to be bored this time, his one liners only work a couple times, Jones is OK , his wry style is there but he has nothing to do except cash in his paycheck. Perhaps Men in Black is the type of off beat story that could only work once, the sequel really is a retread of the first movie but it doesn\\'t feel fun or fresh.Grade: C-\"', '\"I think M:I-1 had a much better plot. At least, it DID have a plot. If there is any plot at all in M:I-2, it\\'s carefully disguised in a rubber mask. The formula for making this film was: get a James Bond film, remove all the girls but one, put in some Jackie Chan gymnastics, and add a few rubber masks. Anyway, those masks are great for the suspense, you never know who is who.For an action fan like me, this is a very good film, as one could expect from John Woo. Very dynamic, if you know what I mean. At several points, I thought \"Ouch! That must hurt!\". The action scenes are well distributed along the film, with the power steadily increasing to the breaking point at the end. The motorcycle chase, in particular, is among the best chase scenes I have ever seen in the movies.To enjoy this film, turn off your left brain hemisphere and activate all your adrenaline receptors. I rather liked it, but not too much. It\\'s more like \"Mission: Frenetic\". And it should have more, prettier, girls. I give it a 6.\"', '\"I didn\\'t really go in with any expectations of seeing another \"American Beauty,\" which probably helped me enjoy it a little more.  It\\'s nothing more than the template traitorous-secret- agent-steals-weapon-threatens-world plot we\\'ve seen before (wasn\\'t one of the 007 movies like that?).  Other than that, there\\'s lot of neat action stuff, some cool motor-bike scenes and some fighting that made me wonder if I had accidentally gone to see \"The Matrix\".If you want to see a good action flick, see this one.  If you want something profound, you\\'ll probably be disappointed.\"', '\"never have i seen a movie this year as long and drawn out as bad boys 2. The jokes took 10 minutes to tell. The action was loud and messy, you could not tell what was going on. There were so many scenes that were just pointless. Rats having sex on screen? what? is this needed, how does this advance the story? The scene at the door with the girls date was just mean and unfunny and had nothing to do with the plot. This movie is just bad, sure i laughed at a few jokes and enjoyed the end and the firefight in the bad guys house. But overall i feel sorry for people that think rats having sex on screen or threating a minor with a gun is funny.\"', '\"I mean, it has Samuel L. Jackson and Christian Bale and just by that we can consider it a big movie. But the storyline it\\'s kinda boring sometimes, the others characters aren\\'t THAT iconic so it\\'s basic Sam carrying them all along the show.\"', '\"When it comes to action movies, John Woo is almost a genius. Rarely have I seen so many exciting elements packed into one film. The startling thing is that it all worked wonderfully! Mission: Impossible 2 is one of the best action movie to come across the silver screen in years.The first offering in this series was marred by an over complicated plot structure that made the movie difficult to follow at some points. The plot elements of MI2 were simple enough: A deadly German virus is about to reach the open market and wreak havok on the world as we know it. Ethan Hunt is charged with assembling a team of specialists to keep that from happening, including a beautiful professional thief. The execution of the plot is amazing. It shows a much more human side of the character and focuses more on the love story aspect of the movie than your typical action pic.Then there are the action sequences. Tom Cruise is a total bad ass. Motorcycle chases, car chases, rock climbing, gun fights, hand to hand combat, knife fights and cool computer stuff, all executed by a very attractive leading man. John Woo can make an action sequence art.I think this will be the best action flick of the summer.\"', '\"I must say Die Another Day was quite a ride. The movie was very fast paced and EXCELLENT! They [the crew] weren\\'t lying when they said that DAD will bring Bond into the 21st century. The villain was portrayed excellently by Toby Stephens and Halle Berry did an excellent job playing Jinx. Might I add, that Zao belongs with the all time memorable henchman list. He belongs all the way up there with Jaws and Oddjob. The car chase was perhaps ONE OF THE BEST car chases EVER filmed. The idea of the car (which is the Aston Martin Vanquish) turning invisible (which is explained by Q) was a bit far fetched but Bond all the way.\\nI would also like to say that the is very fast paced. Before I knew it the movie was over. But nevertheless the movie kept my attention and on the edge of my seat. Since I am a die-hard Bond fan, I think DAD is different than past Bond films. It is hard to explain, but when you see it you\\'ll know what I\\'m talking about. Verdict: 9.0/10 GO SEE THIS MOVIE Rated Brosnan Bond Films: 1. Goldeneye 2. Die Another Day 3. The World is Not Enough 4. Tomorrow Never Dies \\n~Trevelyn006P.S. This film BLOWS Vin Diesel\\'s cheap imitation out of the water. Stick that in your pipe an smoke it Vin!\"', '\"Yes, it\\'s sequel time again! I finally got around to watching this recently and I have to say I think I\\'ve found the perfect way to enjoy any movie. First, you have to listen to all the negative reviews of the film, then go and see it. You\\'ll be expecting something so dire that the reality will be a pleasant surprise, nay, even enjoyable. Such was the case with MIB2.That said, though, this has to be one of the most blatant \"let\\'s redo the first movie\" sequels that I\\'ve ever seen. Let\\'s recap...In the first movie the MIB have to recover the \"galaxy on Orion\\'s belt\" or the Earth will be destroyed. The love interest comes in the form of a morgue worker who falls for Will Smith. There\\'s a big-ass alien monster that the MIB have a showdown with at the end. There\\'s a scene with the MIB\\'s car flying.In this sequel the MIB have to recover the \"light of Zartha\" or the Earth will be destroyed. The love interest comes in the form of a waitress who falls for Will Smith. There\\'s a big-ass alien monster that the MIB have a showdown with at the end. There\\'s a scene with the MIB\\'s car flying.You begin to get the idea? This isn\\'t so much of a sequel as a blatant remake. The Italian Job remake is more different from its original than MIB2 is from its predecessor.Having got that out of the way, the film still manages to amuse, though there are moments where it does make you groan rather than laugh, the jokes being so predictable. But still, it has its moments. Frank the Pug is one of them. There\\'s also more screen time for Tony Shalhoub\\'s \"Jeebs\" character this time around, though there are only so many times you can see his head explode and grow back before it gets stale.Tommy Lee Jones seems to be totally bored this time around. One wonders if he was dragged kicking and screaming  back to the set due to contractual obligations. His usual deadpan delivery really did look as if he wished he were dead. Overall though, nothing spectacular. I have to say that I\\'m finding it increasingly difficult to feel any sympathy with Hollywood studios over movie piracy when they churn out such blatant money-spinners as this.Never mind. Let\\'s just hope there isn\\'t a MIB 3!\"', '\"Good thriller and captivating storyline which gives the sense of world war 3. this is a very late review but I enjoy the movie. couldn\\'t careless what other people say because I haven\\'t read the book\"', '\"It is important to understand that this is not a sequel to MI1.  Mission Impossible 1 was a slick, intelligent, spy movie.  MI2 is not.  To compare the two movies is like comparing James Bond to Ronin.  The only similarity is that Tom Cruise plays a character with the same name from the first movie, IT IS NOT THE SAME CHARACTER!First off, the difference in the movies are much like Tom Cruise\\'s hair.  In the first movie, Tom\\'s hair was short and very military like.  That\\'s what the first movie was.  It was serious and centered less on action.  Tom\\'s hair in the second movie is long and very California-ish.  So is the movie. It loses the military seriousness and trades it for action.  Tom Cruises character has also changed drastically.  He is now longer serious, but quite the opposite.  He is always smiling and happy.  ALWAYS!\\nNow, I don\\'t think that is a bad thing.  I liked this movie.  The action sequences are amazing, and with leave you breath less.  However, being a fan of the first film, I didn\\'t like it as much.  Most people didn\\'t like the first film because they couldn\\'t understand it, Keyser Soze syndrome it\\'s called.  So, if you didn\\'t get the first film, you will like this movie.However, if you enjoyed the first film and expected a real sequel, go rent Ronin.\"', '\"This movie is great. It\\'s really funny, really clever, full of action and coversion and chicks can dig it. The actors do an awesome job. With such a wide range of acting styles, it\\'s really amazing to see it work out extremely well. Everything you could do to make a movie great has been done.\"', '\"As i said John Woo has a great gift, he has to start working in better films so he can set himself into a course to win an oscar award. About the movie the story sucks, the script is not good enough and it gets really annoying to watch this bull***t story which you \\'ve already seen in other films. Tom Cruise is nice, i would love to see for example Jean Reno again, not the bad guy who doesn\\'t seem to be so bad at all. Anthony Hopkins is the role i loved, although he played for some minutes. Ving Rhames is the third role i liked, the second is Thandie\\'s Newton character, herself is nice actor but not so great, i think she has a great and very bright future. i don\\'t recommend it if you really want to take a good look of mission impossible can do see the first part but if you want to see action and chaos see it. It is the best adventure film, from the director\\'s side, from the script\\'s side the best is the first part. V.M\"', '\"This was on TV a few days ago and I thought it was funny. The movie was about a Chinese man(played by Jackie Chan)who goes to the Wild Wild West and meets up with a quirky young man who is a train robber played by Owen Wilson and the two unlikely duo set off to save a Chinese princess(played by Lucy Lu)who is kidnapped,and its up to Chan and Wilson to save her. The humor is funny and the acting was very good. Chan was awesome and Wilson was great as im a fan of his since Meet The Parents all the way to Night At The Museum franchise. He actually reminded me of Jedadah(who he plays in Night at the Museum)in this movie. The action was great and for a Western Parody I say check it out. I enjoyed it.6.6/10\"', '\"I thought that The Fast and the Furious was a great movie. Although I did enjoy the cars in the movie, I also enjoyed Paul Walker, who played Officer Brian O\\'Connor/Brian Spillner. This movie really got me hooked on him. I have also seen Joy Ride with him and liked that too, not just because Paul Walker is in it! I have always been into cars, so when this came out, I was psyched. I love how they drive the Celica in it, cuz that is my ultimate car right there and hope to buy one some day. The Fast and the Furious is jam packed with hot cars and action as the audience is thrown into the world of street racing. I hope that they do a sequel, although I do not think it would be as good.\"', '\"This was the best Bond film since probably Live and Let Die. In the first three acts, it was very Fleming-like. James Bond is tortured and battered to a degree only seen in those novels from the fifties and early sixties. It is over the top at moments but using an actual \"rogue\" nation,along with the very possible reality of some of the technology used in the film, keeps the plot very plausable. Though I was somewhat disapointed by Halle Berry\\'s performance, I was impressed with the newcomer Rosamund Pike.\"', '\"I really don\\'t understand why everyone hates this movie. I saw it in the theatre, and later i\\'ve bought it on dvd. I think this is a very good movie, directed by John Woo( face/off, The Replacement Killers, Broken Arrow)The story, i have to say is a little bit lack, but i liked it anyway. Not every movie need to have a great storyline. The acting of this movie is very good, especially Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames (who always acts great in movies) Thandie Newton is a beautiful girl who also plays in it.Some actionsscenes are superb, think about the racescene between Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton). Really good scene and nice filmed. Think about the latest actionscene, on the beach. A little bit Matrix-style ( i liked that)Mission Impossible 2 is very different if you compare it with the first one. I think that Mi2 is great but made for a narrow audience between 12-35.I reccomand you to rent or buy this movie if your between twelve and thirty-five years old.\"', '\"Surprisingly, a much nicer experience on the second viewing; Oceans 11 really isn\\'t as bad as I once thought.  I suppose it succeeds as a popcorn flick; although I couldn\\'t help but wonder what might have been with this talented cast, and of course its brilliant director.  Nonetheless, the film is far from perfect, but it manages to satisfy -- in the most mediocre way possible.Andy Garcia is the standout to this all-star cast.\"', '\"In a lot of cases the \"II\" is a kind of warning sign, of course with some praiseworthy exceptions. I should have read the signs in this case...How can a director who has given us films like \"The Addams Family\", \"Get Shorty\" and of course \"MIB\" create such a sequel that sucks utterly? Where is the suspense, the humor, the quotable lines, everything that made \"MIB\" a pleasure to watch? The sequels screenplay could have been written on a stamp. In the 88 minutes of this film I had time to regret every single cent I spent on it. I can understand Agent L, who left the MIBs to work again in her mortuary. It is an improvement.\"', '\"This movie isn\\'t anywhere near as good as the previous one. The story is dumb, and it isn\\'t as funny. There isn\\'t really anything to say about this movie. Its just eh. Its worth watching I guess, but its not as entertaining as the previous movie.\"', '\"A few minutes into MIIB, as Will Smith is riding a giant alien worm called Geoff through the New York subway, my 8-year-old son announced \\'That looks so obviously fake\\'. I couldn\\'t really argue: the CGI effects were extremely shoddy.That\\'s probably because MIIB is essentially a money-making exercise, a rushed mess with a half-arsed script full of lame jokes, cruddy performances (Johnny Knoxville is seriously irritating), and some of the most unsubtle product placement imaginable. It seems as though no-one could give a damn about the standard of film-making, just so long as a profit was made at the box-office and everyone involved received a big fat paycheck.It really is no wonder MIIIB has only just been made, a whole decade after this debacle saw the light of day: they were leaving it long enough for people to forget just how embarrassingly bad this second film really was before going ahead with a third.\"', '\"This was arguably one of the greatest Bond films ever. It was Pierce Brosnans best.From beginning to end the action was mind blowing. The settings from many different countries were exotic. The characters were really good (with the exception of Madonna).The plot maintained interest levels throughout. It was a typical Bond movie with fast cars and fast women. It has all the classic elements of a typical Bond film.After the disappointment of World Is Not Enough this movie is like a breath of fresh air. I would advise anyone to watch this movie, its an enjoyable movie experience and has brought James Bond films back on the map.Daniel Craig eat your heart out!\"', '\"When Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), head of a successful software company, is kidnapped, Charlie and his \\'angels\\', Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu), are hired to rescue the missing man, unaware that they are merely pawns in a complex revenge plot.No matter how dumb this big-screen adaptation of the \\'70s TV series gets (and it gets REALLY dumb in places), I find it hard to hate too much on any film that steadfastly refuses to take itself seriously, exploits every opportunity to squeeze its babelicious trio of stars into sexy attire, delivers several truly ridiculous action scenes, and features Crispin Glover as a creepy kung-fu kicking villain with a unique way of smoking a cigarette.Some of the silliness can start to grate (yes, Tom Green, I\\'m talking about you!), but the gratuitous eye-candy and excessive scenes of mayhem more than make up for any cringe-worthy moments, best bits being the OTT opening that quickly establishes the \\'anything goes\\' comic-book tone, Crispin Glover\\'s alleyway brawl with the girls, Diaz dancing in her pants, and the sexy trio dressed as German milkmaids (patting each others\\' heinies to an Oompah tune).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.\"', '\"In short, wonderful first thirty to forty minutes, but it all falls to pieces with no cohesion or intellect and some of the laziest plotting I\\'ve witnessed.  Did the writers (who wrote the wonderful \"World Is Not Enough\") write this with firearms placed firmly against their foreheads?  And Tamahori\\'s direction varies from adequate to incredibly annoying with incessant usage of slow-mo, fast-mo, and what can only be described as skip-mo.And the technology displayed in the movie...don\\'t get me started.A real shame.\"', '\"After the (2001) Ocean\\'s Eleven re-make they should have left it alone. Lightning struck, but not twice unfortunately. Having a second time around where they get \\'caught\\' by Garcia\\'s character is slightly more than just a little embarrassing. Get my meaning from the spelling there?! It made them look like a bunch of \\'Wussies\\'. That is how silly this new Ocean\\'s twelve is. The biggest thing for me about this is that I like these players. They all brought a ton of talent and pulled this thing \\'off\\' with incredible style and ease. With the first remake, not only were the camera-film shots very pleasing and artistic in set up, but also complete in story view/telling. The lines felt as if they were straight out of \"the book of cool\" from the sixties, only with a current \\'pop\\' to them. Pitt was perfect. Always sporting a good appetizer platter with him and a well-delivered line not too much, not too little, just right. Along with Clooney and the rest, just fell solidly into place. Epic, right down to the soundtrack that blended into the foreground and back drop, bounced and moved along in and out with a silky-groove-dream sequence sensibility. The score (music) was the additional character that should have made that one \\'Ocean\\'s twelve\\'.The story I thought had graduated into current times and left the sixties version at a deficit. The interaction between the players from the two Utah brothers,(Caan and Affleck) who were more like elementary school kids than skilled heist men, that was obviously part of the fun! To the blackjack dealer with attitude (Bernie Mac-man) Clooney\\'s Danny Ocean was one of the funnest characters he has had along with other good supporting guys (Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner) they all were top drawer in this hip-heist film. It was an \\'edgy\\' story that made it out alive...Then they had to make a sequel. How many sequels truly make it. Probably less then more. Anything to make money right? Naw, couldn\\'t be, \"We\\'re having a lot fun!\" They said. Well good deal for them, but in the mean-time write something else good, and or original. But for me this is a library addition keeper of a good time. Ocean\\'s is tops. (****)\"', '\"*Ocean\\'s SPOILERS* Danny Ocean (George Clooney) has just been released from prison, but has already a plan to rob 3 casinos, a plan which he explains to his best friend Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), a skilled conman now respectably earning a pretty good living teaching poker to TV Stars (self-mocking cameos by Joshua Jackson (Dawson\\'s Creek), Barry Watson (7th ring of hell... oh, sorry, 7th Heaven), Holly Marie Combs (Charmed) and Topher Grace (That \\'70s Show)).The plan begins to take form when Danny and Rusty pull into this scam an entrepreneur (Elliott Gould) who hates the proprietor of the 3 casinos in question, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) for having decided to blow up said entrepreneur\\'s casino.But they\\'ll need more than just the three of them; in total, 11 men.And so the recruitment of the remaining 8 people (between whom we have Linus (Matt Damon), a 2nd-generation pickpocketer, a couple of litigious twins (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan), a croupier (Bernie Mac), Basher Tarr, a genius in explosives (Don Cheadle), an old conman (Carl Reiner) and others...) begins, but what is Danny\\'s real reason for the elaborated scam and coup? The money? Or the entrancing Tess (Julia Roberts), Danny\\'s ex-wife and now Benedict\\'s girlfriend? This is one of the few remakes (Poseidon and - as I have heard - The Hills Have Eyes are other two examples) that manage to be even more entertaining than the original (in Poseidon\\'s case, even making a silent movie would have been more entertaining than the original movie).The script gives us so many twists and turns that we never know what\\'s going to happen next, while keeping that slick, classy-comedy tone, all the actors give the right tone to their characters (Clooney, Mac, Cheadle, Affleck and Caan are especially a treat, as are the firecracker dialogues between Clooney and Roberts, which bring back to mind \\'The Philadelphia Story\\') and every single other part works toward making \\'Ocean\\'s 11\\' a must-see movie.Ocean\\'s 11: 8/10.\"', '\"\"Die Another Day\" is British/American co-production from 2002, so this film is almost 20 years old now and of course this is another entry to the super successful James Bond franchise. In fact, these over 130 minutes were the final film for Pierce Brosnan as 007, so when this came out, he was basically in the same spot as Daniel Craig is now, also almost the same age as Brosnan was just minimally younger, namely slightly under 50, while Craig is slightly over. Then again, the current Corona pandemic also takes its turn on the release of the new film. Not sure how old Craig was when they made the movie. While waiting for the new Bond, I am enjoying the older films these days again and also writing a bit about those. Now away from Craig though and back to this one here: The director is Lee Tamahori and perhaps you can say that he is the most forgotten Bond film director ever. Hardly anybody remembers the name and looking at what he did before this movie, I must genuinely say that I am surprised he got cast for this film here. I mean his career is not packed with highly flawed movies, but there is also really nothing that makes me understand why they got him for this huge project. It cannot just be his name and the strong connection this film has with Asia and Asian chraacters, especially because Asian is not even his main origin. We will never know. Speaking of the Asian impact in this movie, I come to think that Bond films just like to use this background. Connery had one, Moore did as well and so does Brosnan, even if there is no Asian Bond girl in here. Yeoh happened earlier already. The Asians in here, also the women, are just in charge of torturing it seems. Also this film takes us to many other interesting corners of the world again like Cuba for example. It all starts in North Korea though and there is a crucial change, however. Bond manages to defeat the guy he is up against early on, but still is arrested by the man\\'s father eventually and spends more than a year as a prisoner in North Korea. Certainly not a pleasure. Pretty unusual because Bond otherwise manages to get out safely, especially during the opening sequences. But there is a bit of pain attached to the character here, something Craig used a lot more in his moves in terms of suffering. Eventually, it is not his captors that he has to feel from (because they let him go in exchange for another prisoner), but his own. We see Dench\\'s M speak really harshly to him, but then it seems she still helps him in getting away. I must say there were a few moments where I struggled with everything Bond managed, dealt with and achieved in this movie we have here. How he is still as strong, versatile and ruthless as he has been in other films, although this time he got tortered in the most severe manner by North Koreans. It felt a bit unrealistic how he was back to his usual invincible self so quickly. But maybe that is just me. By the way, interesting how we see Bond being tortured in the animated title sequence that was used to depict the story. Really unusual for Bond movies. Normally, it is just effects liked to the movie. The theme song we hear at the same time is from Madonna, so a real global superstar. It was okay, not one of my favorite songs, but it isn\\'t bad either. It got nominated for a Golden Globe too. Madonna also has a brief cameo here on one occasion. Her character seems linked to the main antagonist and introduces Bond to the latter (and his assistant), but we don\\'t find out anything about the details. She is not won over by Bond\\'s charme though. She does not like dick waving contests, so sure played a pretty confident character. Next that follows is the spectacular fight between the two alpha males. That was nice and also showed us the main antagonist\\'s hatred towards Bond right away. And at the end we know why there is such hatred, which would have been really unjustified if they had only met. But yeah this was one moment I found unrealistic, like how can Bond be on par with the man there after the time in Korea. That dude was a contender for the Olympic Games apparently. Come on, guys.Said main antagonist, who has really a lot of screen time, is played by Toby Stephens. And despite how much he is seen here, especially in the second half, he is almost forgotten now as well. It\\'s pretty interesting though how he has been a voice actor for 007 himself in many video games. I think he was alright overall. His material was not always top-notch, but he tried to make the most of it and frequently succeeded. The one many people will know about is Rosamund Pike, who was really really young stiill when this was made and she is an Oscar nominee now, certainly managed to make it big in Hollywood in contrast to the actor who plays her boss in this movie. Pike palys a triple agent you could say, a really complex character and early on she seemed to be another Bond girl, maybe even the main Bond girl with how they emphasized she is not an easy get for 007 (who was like twice her age), but things sure take a different turn. The one Bond girl at the center of it all is played by Halle Berry and this film came out the same year she won her Oscar. What can I say, she is indeed pretty attractive, but if there is too much to her role as there is to other female agents (from other countries) in Bond films, I do not want to be the judge of. Probably not. Also I remember how she went really qucikly to bed with Bond after they met, but then again Bond has not only not had a great woman like her for a while, but has not had a woman at all because of his forced stay in Korea. So no surprise things become heated quickly, especially after the beach sequence that had a touch of Ursula Andress and Anita Ekberg in their trademark water-related scenes and with the latter I do not mean Bond films obviously. So yeah, Berry was alright, was there, but never really memorable. Also the idea and execution of the idea that the two central female characters fight for their lives at the very end was also nothing that I liked that much. Bond\\'s fight with the main antagonist was better and the latter\\'s outfit, uniform, whatever, was pretty big and spectacular there, just like his ego. If you like the idea that he is indeed the Asian son from the very start is up to you to decide. A bit on the absurd side I\\'d say, also how apparently nobody knew about his past and who he really was and yet he is a public figure, even considers participating at the Olympics. They also used a similar twist in Brosnan\\'s first already I think, the one with Sean Bean. Not gonna go into detail though to avoid spoilers, but I guess you should have seen Brosnan\\'s first when you read here about his fourth. One character who did almost nothing for me was the other Asian with the scarred face. Quite a pity. They definitely could have improved there. In the end, nothing stays memorable except maybe the moment when he is lying there and Bond gets his attention. Even the main antagonist\\'s father was more interesting and he had almost no screen time at all. But what he had was an achievement that almost nobody ever managed in Bond history.He controlled 007 for over a year. Something to be pretty proud of I\\'d say.I was a bit disappointed by this movie here I must say. I remember really liking it when I saw it years ago for the first time and back then, it was among my favorite films of 2002. This time, it is nowhere near. I even hesitated at times if I could give a positive recommendation here. But in the end, it was good enough, even though it is probably among my least favorites from the franchise, also from the Brosnan quartet. I read there were plans for Brosnan to make a fifth movie that could have been directed by Tarantino, but it wasn\\'t mean to be. Nonetheless, Brosnan is still an active actor way into his 60s now and I read he would like to play a Bond villain once, perhaps opposing Craig\\'s successor. That would be nice, a former Bond as a main antagonist. Although, if I could choose, I would take Dalton for the role. There is an aura of dangerous mystery to him. We\\'ll see. Brosnan, even if I like the actor, was never my favorite Bond, on the contrary actually, and seeing once again and afterwards reviewing these four films did not change my opinion one bit. I prefer the others. He is a bit of everything looking at who else played Bond, but not really defining in any area. Still his films have positive moments too. Like the virtual reality glasses (talk about predicting the future there!) and the fun Moneypenny has with them. Well, she got killed the first time they were used, so let her have some fun. This was an interesting inclusion. Those were made (or at least supervised) by Q and with Llewelyn not alive anymore, Monty Python\\'s John Cleese took over for him and look he did so. With a bang! With a friggin\\' invisible automobile! Even Batman can only dream of that. Cleese was introduced in the previous film already, but sadly did not return for the Craig films when they went with the younger Ben Whishaw. I definitely would have preferred Cleese. Moneypenny (Samantha Bond, perfect name, wonder if it helped her in getting the part) also showed us a potential successor in Brosnan\\'s third film, but that successor did not appear in this one here and it\\'s still Bond. Samantha Bond. Oh yeah, Tarantino regular Michael Madsen is in here too. I found it nice to see him. He may not be the most versatile actor, but he is always as cool as they come. Okay, that\\'s all. \"Die Another Day\" gets a cautious thumbs-up from me because it sure has its flaws. Also how they used the film\\'s title as a quote by Brosnan\\'s character sure felt a bit clumsy. Or the entire plot why the main antagonist was in fact evil and what plan he had that was so dangerous. I had in mind that this was a better-crafted film. Sadly, not really. The critics are probably correct. It\\'s still worth seeing unless you despite the genre and/or 007.\"', '\"I really enjoyed this movie. Not only because it was a good remake, but because the casting was well selected. Anytime you put together top notch actors like Clooney, Pitt, and Damon you can only come out with something worth watching and owning. I think the ending of this movie was well planned with just enough elusiveness that you were suprised. I would watch this movie many more times and probably will.\"', '\"You could point out how ridiculously complex the robbery is. You could wonder why Tess dated the casino owner in the first place. You could even analyze the underlying sexism in the story, but by doing so you\\'re really missing the point: \\'Ocean\\'s Eleven\\' is not supposed to be deep or meaningful - it\\'s just very fine entertainment.Danny Ocean (George Clooney), master con-artist and thief, has just been given parole after a few years in prison for the one crime he got caught for. So naturally the first thing he does is get in touch with old partner Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), now teaching stupid Hollywood teen stars how to play poker, and they assemble a crew (his \\'Eleven\\') for a stunningly audacious heist - he\\'s going to break into the vault that holds the cash for three of Las Vegas\\'s biggest casinos during a world heavyweight title fight. Ocean also plans to steal his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) off Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the owner of the casinos.It\\'s a heist movie, and as such there are a few basic elements - experienced pros, talented youth (Matt Damon), beautiful love interest, evil villain, super-secure safe. Yes, it\\'s predictable in its basic plot, but the real pleasure in the movie comes from watching the ingenious robbery unfold, twists, turns, problems and all, and the considerable charm of the stellar cast. The deadpan Pitt and Clooney  and the snakelike Andy Garcia are particularly good, and there are some excellent lines:Clooney: \\'What happened to Billy X?\\' Pitt: \\'Dead.\\' C: \\'He got shot?\\' P: \\'No, skin cancer.\\' C: \\'You send flowers to the funeral?\\' P: \\'Dated his wife for a while.\\'There\\'s not much substance in the film, but there sure is a lot of style.RATING: 7/10Tane\"', '\"I think Bad Boys 2 is one of the best action movies ever. I really like Michael Bay movies, he does really cool action movies, and i like his style. And of course Martin Laurence and Will Smith are good and have chemistry, just like in the original one, and they kind of act just like they did in the original one a little bit, which is good. Let me set it straight. The first Bad Boys movie is pretty much better at the comedy and humor and i guess the story too. And Bad Boys 2 is better at the action. Yes, Bad Boys 2 does have its funny moments, but it had so much action, there was not too much comedy, but as i said it did have some pretty funny moments. Bad Boys 2 did have quite a bit of seriousness to it, which i kind of liked, and it was a little serious during the action scenes, which kind of made the action scenes better. I like how Laurence and Smith blabber at each other during the action. The story in Bad Boys 2 isn\\'t all that great, but its okay. It has a very simple storyline, they are trying to stop a drug kingpin, and all that stuff between Martin Laurences sister in the movie. I loved the action in the movie. I think it is one of the best action movies ever. Lots of stuff gets blown up real good, Michael Bay sure knows how the blow stuff up. I like all the shooting and explosions and shootouts. The first car chase in the movie is great, when they are chasing the Haitians and throwing cars off the car carrier, that was a long car chase, and there is a cool shootout in the middle of the car chase. Tree\\'s, the ground, dirt, cars, Stepals, bushes, mansions, high rises, etc. all get shot up and blown up The movie is a big battleground. The action scenes are very epic and long, so its very detailed on things getting blown up and shot up. The movie is very violent, bloody, and gory. Like that scene at the end in the Mindfield. And there\\'s a scene were dead bodies are being run over. The good old days, when action movies were rated R, and lots of explosions and stuff. And lots of bad words. And no cops get in the way with Martin Laurence and Will Smith which is cool, no getting in trouble, not letting cops get in the way of the cool destructive action. Just action, action, action I love the style of the action. Also, i really liked the music in the movie, especially during the action scenes. It made the actions scenes more intense and gets your blood pumping. And the ending action scene in Cuba at the end of the movie is very pleasing. Yes, the movie may be pretty mean spirited, and pointless and relentless, but it is awesome. Michael Bay is almost like John Woo. This movie is a fun, wild, crazy, loud, action packed ride. Its one of the most action packed movies ever.\"', '\"John Woo must have been a Scooby Doo fan.  Between MI2 and another weak Woo movie Face/Off, the Scooby Doo trademark \"perfect looking\" mask scenes are overdone to the point of sickness.  As in all Woo movies, (face/off, broken arrow), the plot is paper thin and completely predictable and the action scenes overdone.  The movie has no resemblance to the T.V. series. Although Mission Impossible I was a twisted mess, at least it had some sort of resemblance to the series. MI2 copies recent James Bond films instead. Pray John Woo doesn\\'t get his hands on the 007 trademark, because I\\'d have to jump of a tall bridge.I must say I enjoyed the action scenes, but I was expecting more.  If you like thoughtless action movies (which I do sometimes) you won\\'t be disappointed, however don\\'t go into this movie looking for any substance.\"', '\"I wish they would\\'ve made a 3rd one before they got older\"', '\"wow. that was way better than expected. the first was great but yikes, this one blew me away. first of all that was the most action filled movie ever. and on top of it, it was hilarious. i mean i was almost fallin out of my seat because of some of the one liners in this. and i would say it was one of the best movies in the last 3 decades, between the non-stop, awesome action and car chases and the hilarious one liners, this is in the top three for my favorite movies. o and for all you critics out there who gave it a bad rating..... what just because it isnt an artsy fartsy movie doesnt mean it isnt entertaining. it is a great action movie and is much better than the first. a must see for all movie fans. go see it NOW.\"', '\"1st watched 4/8/2001 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-John Singleton): Well-done repeat portrayal of the tough and cool crime stopper from the early 70\\'s.  Although I haven\\'t seen any of the previous three with this character it seems like this movie is more true to the style that seemed to prevail in these type of movies and therefore works much better than those movies that try to modernize(and make money) off of a popular previous theme.(Aka. Mission Impossible, the Saint etc...) Jackson is great as the womanizing yet tough cop with Richard Roundtree from the original playing his Uncle also adds to the movie.  Some corny yet repeatable one-liners seem to be a trademark of Shaft and add some humor to this fairly serious cop movie. Look for more of Shaft in the future(which is okay by me)!!!\"', '\"Great Movie!! Although the ending was pretty predictable all the twists and turns made it seem that it wasn\\'t going to happen that way Characters are developed nicely and the action is never far off.. I\\'m Going To Go See This One Again!\"', '\"Overall: Pretty bad movie and I wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone. I was very bored and it is just not a good movie. Definitely skip it.Good: Samuel Jackson and Christian Bale do good jobs with what they have throughout the movie. Some other minor characters did a good job also. I really liked the music and thought it blended well with the more 80\\'s cop side of the movie.Bad: The movie feels pointless due to the \\'shock\\' ending twist which makes me feel as if I had wasted my time watching it. It is good to see him punished but I would have preferred for him to see the inside of a cell. The characters are just sheer unlikeable or you don\\'t care or they have no real motivations. It also don\\'t feel like it knows what it is. One side you\\'ve got the goofy 80\\'s cop show feel with groovy music and cheesy dialogue while on the other side you\\'ve got the uber serious story featuring themes of race and discrimination. Not to say that serious comedies can\\'t work but if that was the intention it was done abysmally. The action scenes were horrific and just bored me throughout them, especially the final climax. The movie tried to cram in too many characters when a protagonist, antagonist and 1-2 cop buddies would have sufficed. Also unless I missed the scene in which he rejoins the police force then I refuse to let it slide that he broke the law numerous times and got away with it.Best Part: The opening 20 minutes were they catch Bale made me interested in the story and were they could take it but that interest was short lived.MVP: Samuel Jackson as John Shaft3/10\"', '\"I\\'m not sure exactly why it took me so long to see this movie, but I just saw it for the first time last night. I guess I just didn\\'t buy into all the hype when it was in the theaters three years ago.I must admit, however, I was very surprised by this movie. A lot of times, there may simply be too many stars in a film to make it work. But despite all the big name actors in Ocean\\'s Eleven, it works out well. All of the actors gave excellent performances, and it makes a big difference in this kind of film. In fact, the acting and characters are done so well that it\\'s easy to root for the crooks in this film, rather than the \"good guys.\" The heist itself may not have been all that credible, but it was very interesting to see each of the steps that were taken to make it possible, and the amount of planning and coordination that went into the crime.In all, this is a fun and exciting film that is a great way to spend a Saturday evening at home. And it was better than I expected, having seen a few too many bad heist films.\"', '\"What a turkey!! At least the first Tom Cruise MI movie paid lip service to the constructs and concepts of the original TV series. This was nothing but the conceit of Cruise\\'s ego. A boring virus story (done much better in The Andromeda Strain and even Dustin Hoffman\\'s virus movie of a few years ago) becomes the excuse for all the trickery of boring recent James Bond movies combined with the violence of Terminator II raised to the nth power. I put on the DVD and after ten minutes realized I\\'d rather read pre-election coverage in the NY Times, and THAT\\'s boring. It turned out to be perfectly possible to read same and watch the movie simultaneously, missing nothing of consequence because there was nothing of consequence.And there are the special features of the DVD, which attempt to make us believe that Cruise did all these rock stunts in Moab HIMSELF, 2000 feet in the air, with no net or rope, and made the same unbelievable jump about 15 times to get the shot right. Oh sure. Tell me another one.\"', '\"Ok, so can I just say that Brad Pitt is sooooooooo hot. It\\'s entirely possible that he is hotter thatn Jon Bon Jovi, but that is rather debatable. This movie was so good. And it wasn\\'t even the insanely hot guys that impressed me the most. It was the genius of the characters. I suppose upcoming info could be considered *gasp* spoilers so be warned. The best part of the movie was the genius of the characters and how they pulled it off. I guess that would make the script the best part of the movie. And the second best part was how Deanna got in for free (inside joke). So, if you like movies with hot boys or simply movies with coolio plots, you should totally check out Ocean\\'s 11, you\\'ll be glad you did. Have a nice 2002!\"', '\"The beginning half  is very good and  brings back the atmosphere of the older james bond films that has been lacking in the recent bond films. However half way through the film every body seems to give up and the film becomes a bad saturday afternoon tv series episode. the effects are truly awful in action sequences that do not have  any place in the film.   The invisible car, the robocop style suit   that the villain wears and over the top set pieces (yes over the top even for a bond film) all seem to be thrown into the film for little reason and serve little functon. bond himself is given little to do but to become \"more emotional\" which is destroying the much loved character.  he is becoming more of a wet blanket , then a super spy with a lience to kill. Bond deserves better.   The worrying thing is that this terrible film has made a lot of money at the box office and will encourage more bond films of similar quality.   If this is the case lay bond to rest now!!!!!!!!\"', '\"Shanghai Noon: When the Chinese princess is kidnapped from the Forbidden City and taken to America the three bravest Imperial Guards are dispatched to recover her.  Oh, yeah, they also send her cousin to carry the baggage. \\nEvery western stereotype you can think of is brought to bear in this movie - cowboys, Indian\\'s, bank robbers, evil sheriffs, coolies, etc. - and that\\'s exactly why it works: they poke fun at everything and everyone, political correctness be damned!  If you have ever been a fan of the old-fashioned westerns, you will especially appreciate some of the subtler humor i.e., the sheriff\\'s is named after Van Cleef (Lee Van Cleef having been second only to Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti western genre).  The pairing of Chan and Wilson was pure genius, for although they both play simple klutzes, their comedic styles couldn\\'t be more different if they tried.  While Chan relies heavily on physical humor - playing to the camera and grimacing horribly in pain (often for real)), Wilson is introspective and low key punctuating his jokes with a toned down whining nasality.  Yet, both still manage to achieve their desired effect.  The two also mesh extremely well and feed off one another\\'s energy, which adds to the ambience.  Of course, the question on everyone\\'s mind is whether it contains the patented action sequences we expect from a Jackie Chan flick.  The answer is a resounding \"Yes\"!There are some several incredible stunts - the logrolling scene from the trailers is especially impressive. As always there are amusing choreographed fight scenes - Chan\\'s arsenal of weapons includes everything from traditional Chinese martial arts weapons (it is the first time I\\'ve seen a three section staff in a movie in the past decade) to trees and moose antlers.  Also, typical of his films, the fights also maintain a cartoonish quality, highlighting Chan\\'s acrobatic style over blood and gore (it is usually Chan\\'s characters that do the bleeding).If you are starved for a comical action film pull up to the trough.\"', '\"I really wanted to love this film. The original Mission: Impossible was a great action flick that actually made me think. This movie unfortunately took everything I loved about the first one and tossed it out the window. Gone is the semi-cohesive plot that gets your brain working. It\\'s replaced with one of the most by the numbers, boring, script I\\'ve ever seen put to the screen. Woo\\'s direction is typical of him, with a lot of slo-mo shots and ridiculous shootouts. There are some decent looking action scenes, including a well done motorcycle chase scene, although it is completely ruined by the scenes end. My biggest problem with this film is the complete shift in tone. Ethan Hunt is made to look more like a James Bond character and less like himself. It is very clear that this film was the only one that was this way because by the time Abrams took over for M:I3, we were back to the same old Ethan. All in all, this film is a failed attempt to make the Mission: Impossible series \"cool\", when in fact, it was \"cool\" all along.\"', '\"shanghai noon is easily jackie chans best American movie action wise, now don\\'t get me wrong i prefer rush hour as a movie, but shanghai noon is a much better showcase for chan\\'s sort of action and comedy, and for the most part the movie succeeds, and owen Wilson as his partner and friend is hilarious in this. some of the action is brilliantly done, and even though it doesn\\'t touch his hong kong stuff, but is much better than rush hour, and the stunts in this are better and more daring. the reason shanghai noon is so enjoyable is because it works as just a movie, a comedy and an action movie, there\\'s plenty here for everyone. i seen the sequel and i didn\\'t like it, the action was more wire work, and cgi, and it just felt forced, and unneeded. but never the less i recommend shanghai noon, its a perfect film to introduce jackie chan to people and new fans alike\"', '\"I came into the theaters to see this film, not knowing what to expect, but only knowing that the film was a remake.  Though I haven\\'t seen the first release of the film, this years film probably did live up to the original, and then some.  Ocean\\'s Eleven was an excellent picture on all levels. The relationships between the talent involved in the film provided for some memorable moments during the picture that were both funny yet tense. George Clooney and Brad Pitt worked well together as a pair, and personally I loved Bernie Mac\\'s performance as the blackjack dealer.\"', '\"I heard so many things about this movie, seeing how popular it seemed I decided to watch it.Summary: Jack Ryan is a CIA analyst, who made a report of the possible candidate president Nemerov, who suddenly becomes the President of Russia. Anyways, some time back in the 70\\'s a plane went down that was carrying a nuclear bomb, but the bomb never exploded. After so so many years it was found in the rubble in Israel. That bomb was then sold to a secret Nazi militia that wish to put Russia and America to war against each other. In comes in DCI Cabot, who takes Jack Ryan with him to Russia to inspect their nuclear bombs, but get suspicious when a few scientists are missing. As they return the President of USA heads for Baltimore to see a football game, but Ryan discovers a nuclear bomb is going to blow up there at the stadium.Extremely pointless and boring movie, I thought every Nazi plot thing was over and done with. The only person in the movie that seemed to know what he was doing was the undercover agent John Clark (Liev Schreiber) other than that, the movie was bad. Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman, two talented actors were wasted in this movie. I rate this movie 3/10.\"', '\"Lee Tamahori\\'s \"Die Another\" starts off as one of the most interesting James Bond movies in a long time. Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is undercover for an arms deal in North Korea, when his cover is blown. The unspeakable happens-- Bond is captured and tortured for 14 month. This is depicted through the opening credits. Bond is released through a political prisoner exchange for Zao (Rick Yune). However, Bond returns as an outcast. Even M (Judi Dench) tells him that he is a liability-- she can\\'t be certain that he revealed information that lead the deaths of other operatives. Bond must find the ones who betrayed him. From this point on Neal Purvis\\'s and Robert Wade\\'s script slides back into formula which is disappointing given the promising start. Pierce Brosnan as Bond brings his game. He is intense and displaying more of a darker edge to Bond. He is great. The rest of the movie is not as good. Halle Berry as Jinx is all right, though her character is not at all captivating. How she will succeed as a spin-off character remains to seen. Berry is stunning and a good actress, but an action star she is not. Rosamund Pike as the icy Miranda Frost fairs much better as the possible femme fa tale. Toby Stephens as villain Gustav Graves is a formidable opponent for Bond, and is charismatic. This Bond outing has great action sequences including the amazing opening surfing sequence. Too bad this Bond does not deliver on the interesting story premise. It\\'s shaken... but not stirred.\"', '\"I personally hated this movie, for several reasons...Firstly, seeing a (\"modified\") Civic with a 5 foot spoiler and neon lights, flying down a street at 170mph by a fruity pretty-boy high school reject doesn\\'t excite me.

I\\'m also proud to announce that my \\'84 Volvo is apparently ready to go on hijackings using sophisticated equipment (thing that shoots a hook thing) and extensive planning (shoot the hook thing at the thing), as soon as I get myself a neon light or two and a dorky helmet.

If you enjoy movies with a plot, or any other even remotely intelligent values (like adhering to the laws of physics) then this one\\'s a no go, unless you enjoy making fun of things like the little Darias that you are. The special effects are mediocre, just because they either involve fire coming out of cars somehow, or cars flying through the air. They were doing that all the time in the 80s, you know. The characters... yes, they have some character development; By the end of the movie you know that they are all a bunch of losers with way too much money to spend on their Civics. Bottom line: as long as teens are stupid, movies like this will keep being made, to profit on that stupidity. Thats the American way.\"', '\"Well, I can\\'t choose other word than humiliating.Serious Clancy\\'s fan will surely leaving the cinema in great dissapointment. The plot is extremely simplified, and the different timeline between the movie and the novel (Jack Ryan\\'s age and position) will make you find that this movie is a ridiculous.

This time around, with director John Woo at the helm, Tom Cruise back, and Robert Towne writing the script, the sequel is considerably easier to understand in terms of story, and the action scenes are some of the wildest and best in years.The story doesn\\'t really matter that much in a film like this.  It\\'s basically James Bond over again, this time with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) out to stop former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and his henchmen from stealing Chimera, a deadly man-made virus that kills in less than 2 days. To penetrate Ambrose\\'s security, Hunt hesitantly brings in thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to work her charms over Ambrose; she was also his former lover.But not everything goes according to plan, and Ambrose discovers Nyah\\'s real purposes for coming back to him and plans to kill her, but she injects herself with the last strain of the virus.  With 20 hours left, Hunt must retrieve Bellerophon, the virus\\'s only cure, and stop Ambrose from delivering the virus over the world.M:I2 is entirely different in style from its predecessor.  It works as pure action entertainment, and it\\'s all the better for it.  Though it doesn\\'t bring in fight after fight from the beginning, it\\'s never dull, with charismatic performances, great direction as usual from John Woo, and some lovely cinematography.Woo\\'s usual over-the-top style is here, with a little more restraint in terms of blood and gore, but there\\'s no mistaking his touch in the film. His trademarks are here, and as strong as ever.  This film is easily better than the last several Bond movies.  After an entertaining set up, the last 40 minutes are packed with non-stop action, with Woo turning in amazing set piece after set piece.  Whether it\\'s a chaotic shootout in a secret lab, a long motorcycle chase that features a barage of breathtaking stunts (one of Woo\\'s all-time best action scenes, a real compliment), or a climactic martial arts duel on a beach, the last 1/3 of the film don\\'t disappoint if its action you\\'re looking for.The performances are solid for a film of this genre.  Tom Cruise simply exudes coolness as superspy Ethan Hunt, who is truly becoming an even more compelling hero than James Bond.  Thandie Newton is relatively decent as the love interest, though she\\'s a little nonexistent in the last half hour due to the non-stop action.  Ving Rhames gets some good lines in, providing comic relief along with some action muscle.  Dougray Scott is all right as the villain.  We don\\'t really hate him as much as we should, but he does the physical parts of the role quite well.There are a lot of other little elements that work in M:I2.  Hans Zimmer composes another strong score, which reminds a tad of his own work in Gladiator.  The special effects are brilliantly done, the settings are exotic, and everybody involved seems to be enjoying themselves. A can\\'t miss film if you love action.\"', '\"Wow, one can rarely see so many big names in one movie. Clooney, Pitt, Garcia, Damon, Roberts - they could have made 5 top seling hits instead of one.  But top names can do nothing if the story is poor and here the story is poor, or at least very average. They wanted to make a kind of Guy Ritchie movie, but failed to succeed. The love story is flat and so naive! No chemistry at all between Clooney and Roberts. The ending is the worst part, spoiling the movie, which so far had been not a bad action flick. I cannot simply believe that money-loving Julia at one moment turned to georgious George! Even is so, they showed everything literally (do they think the viewer is so dumb???) ending with the compulsory kiss. The action part of the movie is better, but there\\'s been lots of such robbery films and this one does not outstand. The robbery itself is filmed quite well and is surely the best part. Acting? Pitt, Clooney, Damon and Roberts are disappointing. Garcia not bad. To sum it up, I hoped Soderbergh wouldn\\'t join the American mainstream (bad guy, good guy, some better or worse story, nice girl, at the end the good guy gets the nice girl). But he did :(\"', '\"It was a disappointment. When i first found out that they were gonna make Mission Impossible II, i was excited, especially when i heard that John Woo was gonna make it... But it was not what i expected. Just another action film with fanzy filming... I am so tired of seeing the good versus bad fights at the end. The good wins, and lets the bad live, but the minute he turns his back, the bad reaches for his hidden gun or something, and then the good guy has to do a super cool trick to kill him...Despite all this, it is a good action film, nothing more...\"This comment will selfdestruct within 5 seconds\"\"', '\"Charlie\\'s Angels was a fantastic movie it was very well done i don\\'t think there could have been any improvments what so ever there were a few slow parts in the movie but other than that it was awsome.

Charlie\\'s Angels is a must see I rate Charlie\\'s Angels 9/10\"', '\"Now anyone who has seen this movie obviously has never seen point break, i mean its the same movie but with cars and bad actors.  The only nice car in the movie is the dodge charge and it\\'s still a dodge, all in all movie was terrible.\"', '\"I enjoyed \"Men in Black\" and, like most films I enjoy, I did not look forward to any sequels. I just don\\'t like most sequels and my expectations were very low for \"Men in Black II\". Fortunately, I was wrong. While the film was far from a must-see...it was a decent and enjoyable time-passer.When the film began, I was a bit confused. At the end of the original film, Jay\\'s new partner was apparently Laurel (Linda Fiorentino)....but here Jay (Will Smith) is partner-less as he keeps firing partners. It\\'s obvious he would love Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) to return to the MIB force....and soon, it\\' becomes necessary as an evil alien has taken over the joint and threatens to destroy or rule the Earth. What\\'s next? See the film.The bottom line is that the film is fun. Not 100% original, that\\'s for sure...but fun. The actors do their best and the story is fine....not great but fine.\"', '\"I can only comment on the first 50 mins of this - that\\'s all I could stand.Cliched, old hat (slo-mo two handed gun play anyone?), dross, dross, dross, drossMichael Bay has outdone himself. Again.\"', '\"Have you seen it? No? There is likely a very good reason for that...it stinks.Like nearly ALL the endless remakes and reboots that have been plaguing movie goers for the past decade or so....all this is, is a heartless version of the original.It has no heart.It has no soul.It is a retelling of a film that we all love and cherish...and it adds nothing to the story. It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original.\"', '\"This movie is a good combination of James Bond series, Mission impossible and some Hong-Kong martial arts movies. In addition, there are very pretty girls who seduce everyone in this film. Another positive moment is that the movie doesn\\'t use any nakedness for special attraction. It\\'s just plenty of action funny scenes with relevant music. Only deficiency - is the absence of story. Girls are unforgettable. 8/10\"', '\"Sequels. Sometimes they\\'re good. Sometimes they will take an original and build off of its foundation, expanding the story and further developing the characters. Sometimes they will take us to new places, and explore new themes. Show us a world beyond the confines of the original. Prove to us that they are necessary to tell an on-going story with the characters we loved so much in the first film. Sometimes they are worth it.Yeah, and sometimes, they are lazy. Sometimes they\\'re astonishingly under-written and over-reliant on clichÃ©s and other cheap storytelling tactics. Sometimes they feel soulless and patronizing to the audience. Sometimes they show themselves to be the unneeded cash-in\\'s that they sometimes are.I think you can tell which of those two categories this sequel falls into. (Hint, it sure ain\\'t the first!)\"Men in Black II\" is one of the more disappointing follow-ups to an outstanding original film that I\\'ve ever seen. While the creative team of Barry Sonnenfeld directing with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones starring returns, that lightning-in-a-bottle tragically isn\\'t able to be re-captured here. Instead, we are treated to 89 minutes of contrived nonsense and an endless parade of references to the original film, in a sequel that truly feels written by committee in a studio-executive\\'s office in order to be as unoffensive and broad as possible.Smith returns as Agent J. While investigating an alien murder in New York City, J comes to realize that the perpetrator in this case (plant- creature Serleena, portrayed by Lara Flynn Boyle in an over-sexualized performance) has ties to his former partner, \"Agent K.\" (Tommy Lee Jones) J is forced to bring K out of retirement and undo the process that wiped his memories, before they re- team to scour the city searching for clues to stop Serleena\\'s dastardly plans.On paper that may not sound too bad, but in execution, it\\'s pretty dreadful.The acting is far more mixed in this film. Smith is decent as J, but he feels very flat and forced in comparison to the original film. Like his heart isn\\'t quite in it. The same goes for Jones, who barely seems to be putting effort in. Lara Flynn Boyle is very underwhelming as our villain, and the fact that she\\'s always over-sexualized (introduced to us in a scene that includes a closeup of her rear-end as she walks around in high heels and lingerie) does make the entire film feel sort of misogynistic. Supporting roles by Rosario Dawson, Rip Torn and Johnny Knoxville are generally decent, but the lack of development does harm everyone.The direction is also a lot more sedated this time around. Sonnenfeld doesn\\'t seem to be having as much fun behind the camera, and the script by Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro (and probably a team of uncredited ghost-writers and script-doctors to dumb it down for the studio) is far too safe in terms of keeping the development limited and the storytelling far too over-easy to grasp. This is far too simplistic a film for it\\'s own good- it\\'s just J and K driving around, stopping at a location for an action set-piece and a 30 second vignette to further the story... repeated over and over again.There\\'s also a far bigger reliant on effects this time around, it seems, which hurts the film quite a bit. Although I will admit that the visual effects and creature design by Rick Baker are well-done.And the big problem is the lack of development for any characters, and the fact that the film over-simplifies and regresses many of them. Agent J is made into an oafish jerk by the script (we find out he\\'s been neauralyzing MIB agents at random, and he seems very closed and cold to his colleagues) and K\\'s back-story and return is very poorly thrown together. He\\'s just sort of a nasty grumpy guy in this film, and the duo\\'s back-and-forth feels more contrived and mean-spirited. New characters are given no development beyond one-dimensional character quirks, so you don\\'t care about anyone.There really isn\\'t too much else to say about this film. It\\'s far from the worst sequel I\\'ve seen, but it\\'s still a radically disappointing follow up to the excellent original. The only silver linings here are the fact that it was able to re-introduce Agent K (though poorly) and the fact that the third film, released 10 years later, was actually pretty darned good and made up for this severe misstep.As it stands, \"Men in Black II\" gets and underwhelming 4 out of 10. If you\\'re a fan of the first film, sure... give it a shot. But don\\'t expect much of anything.\"', '\"You know, I love action movies, I don\\'t mind the unrealistic fights where good always triumphs over evil. But come on, only if it\\'s Arnold or Sylvester, not Tom Cruise. I just love the motorcycle scene where these two men are going at least 100 miles an hour, they jump off the bikes and ram into each other and fall over a cliff and survive and somehow manage to still kick the crap out of each other.******SCENE SPOILER******* Now the mask scenes, you know if you saw the movie how over done were the person having another person\\'s face on their\\'s? How over done was that?! Especially how when the super bad sidekick brings in \"Ethan\" to the evil villain and Ethan is only mumbling? Duh! So the villain being so brilliant kills the sidekick by accident thinking it was Ethan when the man posing as his sidekick is really Ethan! Duh! Because of the over done make up, it was totally predictable.Not recommended, Tom is really becoming too conceited.4/10\"', '\"\"Charlie\\'s Angels\" has been taking a lot of heat for being stupid, ridiculous, immature, etc...and while it\\'s definitely not a great film, I can\\'t help but half-enjoy it.Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu fill in the shoes of the Angels, from the hit TV show \"Charlie\\'s Angels\"--remember that show? Well, in this film, the Angels must stop a madman from doing something bad somewhere in the world. I\\'m not really sure what the plot was, because there really is no plot per say. This film is an excuse for two of Hollywood\\'s prettiest women (Cameron Diaz & Drew Barrymore) running around blowing stuff up in bikinis. I\\'d have to say that the only thing that keeps this movie from being a better piece of entertainment is the annoying (and horrible actress) Lucy Liu. According to IMDb.com and shows like \"Entertainment Tonight\" and \"Access Hollywood,\" Bill Murray (who played Bosley in this film) did not return for the upcoming sequel because he didn\\'t like working with Liu. I can\\'t say I blame him. Just the sight of her ugly face on screen makes me cringe. I remember an interview with Murray back on the set of the original film, and they asked him about alleged arguments with Lucy Liu on set. He said the accusations were false, but I could tell he was lying.But apart from her, the cast is quite ensemble. The hilarious Bill Murray keeps this film from becoming nothing more than a bikini advert, and the enjoyable Tim Curry helps Murray a lighten the mood a bit in one of the scenes.Sometimes the film uses very odd filming techniques, and \"McG,\" the director, seems to try and go too much for a modern look. But, in a way, it gives the film more of a summer-flick feeling than anything memorable, which is all I want \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" to be.The person going into this expecting Oscar-material has a screw loose.This movie is a lot like the film \"MI:2\" (\"Mission: Impossible 2\"): it delivers a whole lot of action for a nice night in. It\\'s a summer flick, and nothing more. Pure Entertainment. Maybe a bit whacky at times, but nevertheless entertaining and fun, regardless of some flaws.3/5 stars -John Ulmer\"', '\"Men in Black II was a boring and unfunny film from Barry Sonnefield. The first Men in Black was good and actually made me interested into it and waiting for its sequel but when I watched it I just got bored. It was as same as the first film and all the new characters were bad and there costumes were stupid. The acting wasn\\'t good either and the dialouge was horrific. Will Smith as usual is there to come and save the day like all the rest of his movies, blah blah blah blah blah. I thought the film had some funny parts by Tommy Lee Jones mainly, but it still just got me unintersted in it. That was itHedeen\\'s outlook: 5/10 *+ D\"', '\"The only reason I even give this movie a 1 is because of the opening scene, which is by far the most original and exciting scene in the movie. The fight scenes are over-choreographed. The plot is rediculous. The acting basically consists of the three main actresses playing their \"look\" into the camera. Even Bill Murray is dissapointing. Did somebody actually go to this, and leave the theatre thinking \"Yha, that was worth my time and money.\" ?Just like the one-line summary says, TERRIBLE !\"', '\"the blatant disrespect for human life, was just beyond belief! i\\'ve seen splatter movies with more respect for human life than this! any person acting like the 2 \\'heroes\\' should be locked up and executed.the worst movie i\\'ve seen in my entire life. the morale of this movie was = murder is ok.the gun is good..if anyone recommends this movie to you - please disregard them - and inform the police.\"', '\"My first thought before seeing the movie: Oh no, not another remake from a seventies movie!!! After seeing it I have to admit that it wasn\\'t bad. Nothing special perhaps, but not bad.I don\\'t know what is wrong with Hollywood, but it seems like all inspiration has gone. Why do they need to make remakes, has everything already been done than? And even when everything has already been done, in my opinion that still shouldn\\'t give today\\'s producers the right to copy past successes. I still prefer to see original movies. Having said this I have to admit that Samuel L. Jackson did a great job as John Shaft, the cop that will fight all crime on his own without getting wounded a single time. Shaft is really untouchable. He walks away from a car crash like nothing has happened, bullets fly around in the air, but he doesn\\'t get hit. However, when he shoots, he almost never misses. Very nice to see, but not really close to reality if you ask me.In fact: Samuel L. Jackson is probably the only reason why I\\'ll remember this movie in a few days time. I\\'m sure it will not be the story or the cinematography that make this movie unforgettable. The story is rather weak: The good, untouchable black cop chases a rich, racist white murderer and will get him to court, no matter what ... The scenes aren\\'t that special either. The action shots are well done and the sliding screen shots (when a new scene starts) as a reference to the seventies movies is a nice feature. But it just isn\\'t enough to make me forget about the weakness of the story.I recommend this movie to the fans of movies like Dirty Harry. I\\'m sure they will love this one as well. Personally I wasn\\'t so touched by it. I give it a 6/10 (only because of Samuel L. Jackson\\'s performance)\"', '\"I must say that I have seen some negative commentaries on MI II, but this movie has all: Tandy Newton is hot!, there is action enough to blow away the screen on the TV and the bad guys are BAD, the last 20 minutes are packed with more action that the 100 minutes of most of other so called \"action\" movies. Jhon Woo makes it again and V. Rhames, the helicopter guy and John C. McLoy give a great performance. In some way it is similar to The Bourne Identity, Die Hard and Lethal Weapon. I almost forgot Anthony Hopkins. He is on 5 or 6 minutes in the whole movie, but it worth it like all Hopkins performances.Well, We will see how is doing MI III and hope there is a IV and V.\"', '\"It\\'s a heck of a lot like \"Rush Hour,\" but I liked Owen Wilson more than Chris Tucker, and this film features more of the elements that make a great Jackie flick.  Namely, fighting and stunts.  Chan and Wilson have great chemistry, and many of the western cliches are explored to hilarious effect. I love Lucy Liu, and here we get to see her kick some butt, as well as look as lovely as ever.  The two stars\\' different types of humor work very well together, and it\\'s got some great cinematography, too.  I would definitely call this Chan\\'s best American film, and would go so far as to say it\\'s a great place to start if you\\'ve never seen his work and are seeking an introduction....\"', '\"I went to see the latest Bond - Die Another Day last night and have to sheepishly admit I quite enjoyed it.      I personally liked the opening sequence that gives us a frantic hovercraft chase, Brosnan being tortured by scorpions, and surreal mtv-style opening credits to go with Madonna\\'s theme song. The website also has a good Madonna music video, with elements stolen from the film and re-hashed to feature Madonna. Concentrate on what people are good at, was maybe the motto of esteemed Director Lee (Once Were Warriors, Along Came a Spider, Mulholland Falls) Tamahori. Madonna\\'s acting presence is wisely kept down to a cameo appearance where she looks every bit her age and not very charismatic.    As current spy-chase-caper movies go, Die Another Day isn\\'t bad. Dedicated 007 fans will hearken back to the days when we saw real stunts instead of CGIs (some of the present special effects are poorer than could be achieved with less adventurous but more realistic live action). But this is very much a give-\\'em-what-they-expect movie and the plot (which takes a while to twist and turn to its cliche ending), script (classic \\'Bond-style\\' one-liners that are more self-referential than new), babes (Halle Berry is very modern day and at-home in super-hero movies), and a star-studded cast add up to an enjoyable movie night. People who want depth have got a bit of a cheek expecting it from a Bond movie after all.      The weakest point of the film, for me, was Pierce Brosnan who, at almost 50, hardly looks capable of the sustained action with which the special effects credit him. Vin Diesel set a hard act to follow as the realistically fit action-hero spy in XXX, and Matt Damon gave us the intelligent intelligence-agent in Bourne Identity. Austin Powers has set the standard for out-and-out comedy. The attraction of Bond has  been very much a fantasy world where people drink martinis, dress impeccably and do lots of fun dangerous things, all with a British, or especially English, nonchalance. Connery carried it off well as he has tremendous presence, a passable acting ability in set roles, and a Scottish accent to add a bit of spice. Brosnan is something of a stuffed shirt by comparison, his Irishness is never optimised and his idea of being an English gentleman type is undermined by a story that is heavily Americanised. His limited acting skills are well-covered by surrounding him with Oscar-winning actors Judi Dench and Halle Berry, not to mention the here very capable John Cleese and tough-looking Michael Madsen. It would appear Brosnan aspires to be playing James Bond for as long as he can rather than scaling any great acting heights (and there\\'s nothing wrong with that - he\\'s delivering a product that is repeatedly successful by all mainstream commercial standards).      It\\'s not a film that would pull me out to the cinema over and above curiosity but it\\'s better than I expected for all that. I suppose my ideal Bond movie would be made by someone like Michael Mann - but then again he might expect a certain degree of artistic control, which studios and licensees will be reluctant to grant where a Â£142m dollar movie is concerned. Balancing that sort of money on a knife edge is not left to chance if studios can help it - even to the extent of cutting 12 minutes of Halle-get-yer-kit-off for an American optimum film-censor certification. It\\'s a testament to Berry that she brings life to such dumb lines as \"Well that\\'s a mouth full!\" (after being given Bond\\'s full name and glancing at his crotch). The sadness is that the original Bond character still has the potential to be the basis of a really memorable movie - intellectually engaging, brilliant characterisation, a movie for adults, basically. It would cost a fraction of the present Bond budgets to make. But what right have film fans to expect this when they are so outnumbered by moviegoers? Accept Die Another Day on its own terms, gadgets and all, and you\\'ll have a fun family night out at the pictures.\"', '\"Synopsis: This sequel to the $183 million grossing blockbuster, has returning agent Ethan Hunt in search of a turncoat IMF agent who has stolen a virus and plots to unleash it on the unsuspecting city of Sydney, Australia. Part of it a plan to become a very wealthy individual in cooperation with a treacherous pharmaceutical executive. With the help of a former lover of the agent, Hunt infiltrates his operations and finds himself enraptured with his new romance, and driven by his job.The Review: I am nowhere near as good as the reviewer on the first page, but I have to admit, \"MI:2\" is relentlessly stupid, and borrows cliche after cliche, after cliche. There\\'s nothing funnier than seeing the leading action hero shout \"I\\'m not losing you!\" to the damsel in distress, something we\\'ve seen in dozens of films in the past decade. John Woo, quite literally the best action film director today, adds a few deft touches to a film, that is just bad. It seems like all critics want to do is kiss a superstar like Cruise, right on the keyster because he\\'s such a big star. \"Don\\'t take it seriously.\" they proclaim, as they do a direct hypocrisy of this statement with virtually any other summer film, because it may not have a big star. If you want a good action film, I suggest Woo\\'s earlier efforts \"Hard Boiled\", \"The Killer\", and \"A Better Tomorrow II\". His poetry of violence is sprawled throughout these poetic films that are brilliant on their own level. \"MI:2\" is completely different from the DePalma film, in thought and action sequence. Grade: D+\"', '\"Not funny enough to be a comedy, not realistic enough to be a drama, not interesting enough to be a fantasy, Men In Black just may possibly be the worst movie I\\'ve seen in the last year.  Essentially this is a kid\\'s movie. But MIB tries to be more.  And it fails terribly.  I don\\'t understand how any adult mind can be entertained by this stuff.  The plot is utterly ridiculous.  I would explain in greater detail why it is ridiculous, but I fell asleep during the middle. It saddens me to know that millions of ADULTS will be truly entertained by this movie.  The only way to possibly enjoy this movie is to have the mind of a seven year old. If you haven\\'t seen this movie yet, don\\'t.  See something that will stimulate you.  This movie was just awful.\"', '\"The special effects in this movie are great!!  Other than that, this movie lacks an interesting plot, is predictable, and just does NOT live up to expectations.  MI2 is basically a James Bond type movie with Tom Cruise. But even that is giving it too much credit, for the Bond movies are more interesting and have a better plot.  If you like a lot of random action, this movie is for you.  If you like to be kept guessing about the end or like to be challenged by a movie, this is not for you.\"', '\"I have seen this movie 2 times. This flick is great! It was very enjoyable & impressed very much.Screenplay is well-written, and editing is very effective.Most great of this flick is John Woos directing!

Yeah, right. Like we haven\\'t seen a movie like this before. I can easily summarize this movie by relating it to Mario Brothers (the game): Mario kills the inferior bad guys before getting to Bowser, then he saves the Princess, with the help of Luigi and Toad.Sorry, Tom, but this movie really made me sleepy. I mean, come on, what happened to make Ethan grow out his hair? Too much stress? The fact he thought that he could impress the ladies? I have no idea, but...this movie bored me to tears.Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in this slow, dreadfully boring, Spanish guitar playing, stupid slow-mo, Spanish-British loving movie whose action is like...the last 15 or 20 minutes.For the first hour, the movie dragged on with some pretty corny stuff. Why would anyone slow-mo a car wreck? We don\\'t need to see Ethan Hunt toss around his hair like that guy on Shrek 2, do we? No. We want action. We want the Ethan Hunt on the first movie. The one who runs, screams on the telephone, and doesn\\'t have such a serious relationship. If we wanted to watch a movie with so much love in it (it practically revolves around it), we would\\'ve watched Pretty Woman or something. This movie is supposed to have action--but where? Only at the end? I liked the bad guys more in this movie--at least they knew it was supposed to be action.This movie makes me tired just to speak about it.If you want a sleeping pill, go watch this movie. If you want some caffeine, go watch the other. MI three better be good, that\\'s all I can say.\"', '\"\"Mission: Impossible 2\" is one of the few movies that has the oomph to live up to its hype.  John Woo has created a visual spectacle, and the story is just passable enough to maintain interest.Plotline?  Fairly simple....Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called back into service after a rogue agent steals the antidote to a lethal new manmade virus.  With the antidote the villain (Dougray Scott) can attain the virus and wreak havoc on the population.I really want to praise John Woo, he has such a deft touch with action movies and the ones in this are no exception.  Fight scenes, chase scenes all so expertly choreographed that it seems like a ballet.  Top notch action sequences in this one that may only be rivaled this year by \"X-Men\".Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt,and is a engaging presence onscreen.  His chemistry with Thandie Newton (as Nyah, a very beautiful and clever thief) is top notch.  Wonderful characterization here, as Ethan never comes off too serious or too campy, but as a man trying to get the job done.Thandie Newton plays Nyah Nordolf-Hall, a civilian thief recruited by the IMF to help Hunt get to the villian (more on him later) because of a past connection.  I havent seen any of Ms. Newton\\'s earlier work, but may have to go back and see them.  She comes off as a classic elegant beauty, but her character gets little more than the \"love interest\" treatment.  She manages well though, and holds her own against Cruise.Dougray Scott as the rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose.  His deceptive and murderous ways have caused him to turn against those he used to defend and now he is in control of one of the most lethal viruses known to man.  And only he has the cure.  A very well played baddie by Scott, and he even steals a couple of scenes out from under Cruise.  First time I\\'ve seen him as well, but really cant wait to again.Supporting cast is little more than window dressing, although Ving Rhames (Luther Stickell) is more interesting than the rest.  Cracks a couple pretty good jokes too.\"Mission: Impossible 2\" is everything the first should have been, action packed, entertaining, and enjoyable.  John Woo may very well have saved this franchise for Paramount, and should pass tips on how to properly make an action film to the next \"Mission\" director.4 out of 5\"', '\"Oh dear.Where do we start?Let\\'s ignore the fact that this film was poorly plotted, poorly scripted, badly conceived and reminiscent of the tackiest MTV video you can think of. Let\\'s remain blissfully unaware of the production values that would make yesterdays breakfast look like a five course dinner. Let\\'s also overlook the poorest acting I\\'ve seen from young Hollywood \"talent\" since Sunset Beach.Yes, lets.Okay, onto the REALLY objectionable stuff...Firstly, the only oriental characters involved are not only street punk goons but also the primary bad guys. Okay, so the main goon\\'s dad is in it too for about five seconds and isn\\'t very happy at his sons conduct, but this is hardly an excuse to have such a racially imbalanced plotline. This is the 21st century and this cowboys and indians style concept is worthy of a prison sentence, particulary as it comes from a country where racial equality is considered to be a key issue.Secondly, we see lots and lots of cars and... guess what? Oh yes, women wearing next to nothing running around allowing their drivers to fondle their \"assets\", then offering threesomes. Despite the fact that the realisim factor is minute - surely most women would despair of a guy who\\'s life revolved around his car - it also portrays an image of women as mere sex objects to pleasure guys in fast cars. Again, we have one token female who is a racer, but this hardly makes this kind of imagery morally sound, and the camera still takes time to wander over her person with an almost feral attention to detail.By portraying these women as trophies, it suggests that irresponsible behaviour such as street racing can earn you sexual favours. This is of course complete rubbish in the case of nearly every single woman with an IQ above 0.2.Finally, I would just like to point out that the entire plot and premise of the film displays a complete lack of belief in safe, responsible driving. Not a single seatbelt is seen throughout the entire film, people have horrific accidents in their cars then stroll out completely unscathed, and not once did I see a crash helmet or protective clothing except on the \"oriental bad guy goons\". What sort of message is that sending out to our 13 and 15 year olds as they begin to reach the age where they can legally drive?To sum it up, this is a meathead movie, made for meatheads by meatheads. Avoid at all costs and burn copies wherever possible!!!\"', '\"For a lazy Saturday afternoon this was the ideal movie to watch. One of the comments. I heard before going in \"park your brain outside for this one\". All in all this was true, the plot was weak and the characters fairly two-dimensional. But this was not the reason to see the movie, no-one was going to be expecting \"Citizen Kane\". For a movie like this the main point is the action.MI2 was typical John Woo, taking many of the sequences from \"Hard-Boiled\", it was a visual spectacle of the highest order. Some of the stunts were breath-taking, coupled with a great soundtrack it made sure you forgot you were sitting on horrible cinema chairs. If you are looking for a fun movie which requires no concentration, go see it.\"', '\"You know this type of people whose broad and most sincere smile only means that they have come up with some tricky scheme to screw you over? Well, George Clooney seems to be that kind of a person. Once you see his smug face, you can definitely be sure that whatever you buy that he\\'s selling is gonna be the truest of fake.Now add some serious cast, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts (still in her prime), a convoluted heist plot, and enough reason to dislike the bad guy - and you\\'ll be literally waiting for our A-Team to succeed and cheering when it does. Yes, it does indeed. Did you really doubt that for a second?Ocean\\'s Eleven, released in 2001, still belongs to that (hopefully) gone era of Hollywood cinema when easy was fun and style was enough to substitute substance. And damn, how in style this film goes! All shiny and sparkling, with enough fun little twists and moments of humor, with Clooney and Pitt exchanging impeccable smiles and snappy one-liners, with a sleek kingpin of an antagonist and his dumb nitwit minions - and of course with the charm of Las Vegas and its vibe of easy money and endless entertainment - Ocean\\'s Eleven makes you feel like a spectator at a very expensive and exclusive show.But that era is over, and even the general audience is into trying to dig a film\\'s surface, not necessarily deep but enough to expect a second layer to show itself. And that sort of thing Ocean\\'s Eleven is kinda short of. The big talent is wasted on walking around, looking perfect and sounding confident, while the only character carrying at least some emotional charge is the usual suspect of a good person\\'s ex-wife and a bad person\\'s current love interest. So we can only thank Julia Roberts for being a good actress enough to make those small things count and show a variety of emotions on her face. Because it seems that the rest of the stellar cast only took a single facial expression with them on stage.It is said that a casino is built like a labyrinth to keep visitors in. Huge, loud and blinking, but still a labyrinth. And so does this film, like a race through a maze, try to keep you thinking of anything but its essence. The truth is, the real essence of this movie is not Mr Clooney\\'s smile or the wads of cash he and his friends try to steal. It\\'s that fir-shaped car air freshener that is shown to us for long enough to suspect some bizarre case of product placement. A screamingly strong-smelling piece of unidentified material that doesn\\'t really make the air enjoyable for breathing but instead is only suitable for distracting you from realizing how stale and stuffy it is. Well, you could of course let yourself be fooled for the whole ride, but it\\'s much healthier not to take it at all in the first place.\"', '\"Surprise, kiddies, this comment features NO SPOILERS!All I can say about Charlie\\'s Angels is that it\\'s the best popcorn movie I\\'ve seen in years. Its comedy is cheesy to the extreme, and its action sequences are fabulous. Casting of the title roles is perfect, and the design work is stunning.If you feel guilty for watching movies purely for entertainment value, I\\'d recommend hiring \"A Man Called Hero\" or \"Storm Riders\".If, on the other hand, you agree that bubblegum has its place in any balanced diet, switch off and enjoy Charlie\\'s Angels. It\\'s fab.\"', '\"I put this film on and took my headphones out during a fight scene and wow it was much better without the corny 2000s / late 90s sounds and music. Just pure cinematography...this also isn\\'t a good thing or bad I guess.\"', '\"I gave this movie a 4 simply due to it NOT being a \\'Mission: Impossible\\' episode. In the TV, and even in the first movie, it was more of a team espionage show, but this was just another action movie. One major flaw was the Â‘recruiting\\' phase of the movie, where Tom has to charm Thandie Newton into doing the right thing. In the show, and even in different parts of the movie, they always use IMF members with those patented MASKS to fool the bad guys into spilling the beans. So why did they fell the need to Â‘recruit\\' an outsider? Well, that give Tom more screen time and the writers an excuse to put a sappy love interest in the movie. Weak.  On the plus side John Woo\\'s choreography of fight scenes is still superb. Too bad they\\'re used in excess, probably due to a lack of an intelligent script.\"', '\"This is Bruce Wayne as James Bond. All we need is Mr Ice and Poison Ivy to complete the picture. We already have ice and a tropical forest. We even have Catwoman (Halle Berry), and Bond is equipped with a kind of Batmobile that turns invisible (???).I don\\'t know what else to say. I just don\\'t know how this was even greenlighted. It is a complete and utter mess. The story is difficult to follow, you don\\'t know who the bad guys are, or why they are bad guys, nothing that happens makes sense, and ultimately it looks like a script for Batman that someone inserted Bond into.By the way, when \\'M\\' and Minister of Defense got upset with Roger Moore while he was playing Bond, it was endearing and funny. Now they have some old granny who is for no reason always upset with Bond, and watching her scenes is dull and irritating.I guess I enjoyed Halle Berry\\'s bikini. Other than that, it was a film with no sense, no proper tone, and no real connection with the Bond franchise.\"', '\"Tightly directed sequel with clever dialogue, brisk pacing, tongue-in-cheek irreverence, and relentlessly good-hearted fun.  Humor is often low but rarely actually raunchy.Will Smith in seemingly effortless performance characterized by flawless comedic timing.Tommy Lee Jones as amnesiac postal worker who none-the-less retains all of his Agent K character and asperity.Rip Torn is, again, reliably wry and capable in his supportive role.Tony Shaloub in deservedly expanded role, over-the-top funny.Lara Flynn Boyle is delightfully naughty as good-humored alien villain.Rosario Dawson:  her performance rings true, and she positively glows. First time I\\'ve seen her; won\\'t be the last if I have anything to say about it!This movie joins the first MIB on my list of Surefire Laughers.  In my opinion, it is better than the original.\"', '\"This sequel was as good as original. Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames were very good in this spy thriller. Anthony Hopkins also has a supporting role in this film\"', '\"Hey, Tom Cruise.  If you are reading this comment, I want to tell you that your recent movie \"Mission Impossible 2\" STINKS.  Tom, you and your sidekick John Woo (who is reputed to be a very competent director) seem to lack any common sense.  In this movie, your character, Ethan Hunt, is virtually Superman himself.  He can shoot from a moving motorcycle and hit a target without any problem whatsoever.  He is a martial arts expert, better than Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme combined.  He is a great lady-killer, better than Casanova, Don Juan or James Bond. I was amazed that he did not fire laser beams from his eyes.  Ethan nonchalantly does super dangerous things just for the heck of it and succeeds without any problem whatsoever.  Tom, let me teach you common sense.  When a character is so absolutely perfect and super-duper cool, the character becomes very boring and tiring.  Moreover, after Ethan repeatedly puts himself in danger for no rational reason (maybe just for the fun of it), I became sick and tired of his self-indulgent, childish antics.  Even worse, Tom, why did this movie focus so much on your character?  It looked as if your character dominated all the major scenes in the movie.   I saw you so much in the movie that I couldn\\'t stand seeing your face anymore. Tom, don\\'t you know that the fun of any drama--be it a film or TV show--is in watching the interactions of different characters?  There is nothing more boring than looking at one face and listening to one person for hours and hours.  Moreover, because I saw you so much in this movie, I know what kind of person you are.  Your ego is so puffed up that you wanted yourself and nobody else to be acting in this film.  That is, you wanted all the other actors, even greats like Anthony Hopkins and Ving Rhames, to be insignificant bit players.  I remember the old TV series \"Mission Impossible.\"  Using the name \"Mission Impossible\" as the title of this film is a total rip-off.  Your movie \"MI 2\" is \"Mission Impossible\" in name only.  Your movie has no relationship whatsoever to the TV series.  \"MI 2\" does not have the careful planning or the finesse of the TV series.  It is just one long self-indulgence to satisfy your own narcissism.  Many critics accuse your friend Sylvester Stallone of making narcissistic movies.  But compared to you, he is a paragon of modesty.  Tom, you are a peerless narcissist.  In the future, if you want to admire yourself, please do it in front of your own bathroom mirror.  Please do not make a movie for the sole purpose of indulging in self-admiration.  Your ex-wife, Nicole Kidman, once remarked that you love nobody but yourself.  Judging from the narcissism of \"MI 2,\" you must be madly in love with yourself.\"', '\"Truth be told, I was expecting an incredibly dumb gay western film. But once I saw it, I was surprised at its good story structure and theme.Though I\\'m not a regular Jackie Chan fan, I actually enjoyed watching the guy in the film. Honestly, I don\\'t know one bit about him, just that he\\'s famous for doing martial arts films, and this is actually just the second film I\\'ve ever seen with him in it. And I\\'ve gotta say - not bad.And Owen Wilson was the perfect actor for his part. I mean seriously, nobody else could fit the role. He\\'s not the best actor in the whole world, but he certainly took the right turn. He\\'s got the looks, the attitude, the moves, the voice, and even the right hair. His character, Roy O\\'Bannon (a.k.a. Wyatt Earp) is a cool cowboy, robber, and gunman who\\'s all wild west but still a bit wimpy for his taste. He is shown as ambitious and talented (in being a cowboy) but not hard or serious and thoroughly a slight disappointment to his land, like Chon Wang (Chan). Wilson was able to put both the toughy and the whiny in him in all the right parts and situations. He was even able to show the dynamic change O\\'Bannon went through at the end. He went from coward to hero without a flaw and still managed to be humorous. What I didn\\'t like most of all was that they put background rock music in an 1881 setting. Sure, it didn\\'t change the film much and the audience needed at least some connection with the modern world, but Wilson was already taking care of that. They at least could have taken out that \"Cowboy\" song, which is now stuck in my head, by the way!This sounds like a great movie, but as my title suggests, it\\'s missing something. I don\\'t know what it is. Perhaps it was the script, which was actually OK. The film somehow lacks that awe and \"wow\" that makes a movie memorable. Maybe it\\'s just me, but that\\'s the best I can verify it. Something\\'s missing.Overall, it\\'s an enjoyable film with great structure and form with a great theme. I hope you enjoy it. I sure did. I\\'m gonna try watching Shanghai Knights now, it\\'s really got me wondering what happens to our characters.\"', '\"I hate reviews that put this movie down. This movie is so much fun and quite enjoyable, plain and simple. Sure their is not much of a plot but it is quite entertaining. If plot is what you are looking for, why are you watching this movie. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back and better than ever in this action packed sequel to Bad Boys. Their is more action, more humour and a bit more crude. Especially the scene where Lowrey and Burnette went into the morgue and the scene where they are planting the wire into Tapia\\'s house. Joe Pantoliano was better in this movie than the first one. He brings life to every scene that he is in. His character is the guy you would just love to hate. Definitely better than the first movie.\"', '\"Charlie\\'s Angels is totally great. The plot is simple and easy to follow, just like the old series. It\\'s corny with fake laughter happening all the time, but it works.  This is because the film knows what it is, a source of amusement and escapism. It never claims to be more, but boy does it deliver on the feel good factor! I came out of this movie feeling great about myself! It\\'s sexy, funny, action packed fun, that doesn\\'t allow boredom to even enter within a 10 mile radius of the audience. Constantly fresh and always exciting. How can you not like this movie? Diaz\\'s dancing alone must be seen, not to mention Lucy\\'s great fighting talents. To be blunt  I loved this movie, i have this movie on video, and i\\'m waiting with itchy palms for Charlie\\'s Angels 2.\"', '\"I watched this last night. Haven\\'t watched since it first came out. This was pretty good, I see why I got hooked to the franchise. I see now that Old Blue Eyes was the one top dog. i had forgotten about so many parts to the movie. I watched 2 last night was well. I\\'m going to review it next. I\\'m typing this while watching Tokyo Drift..... Oh yea the original crew was dope To bad Ja Rule opted out of part 2. I forgot about the villain in part 1 too I call him Remy. I love him from other movies .... Oh and YES that introduction to Sung Kang aka Hanz . I fell in love with him and been low key stalking him since. He\\'s so cute. I must admit this is one of the better franchises around outside of ... OK let me get to another movie.\"', '\"Why is it that people expect this movie to answer some deep philosophical conflict that plagues humankind? If you go in there expecting American Beauty, you\\'ll be duly disappointed. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.Ugh, the action was good. Woo is GOD! But yes - he still has failed to live up to his Hong Kong expectations thus far, but he\\'s getting pretty damned close.\"', '\"A waste of Anthony Hopkins as an actor (there\\'s nothing for him here), and why did John Woo do this?  The fight choreographer (Billy Morts, also X2, Charlie\\'s Angels 2) is weak compared to most John Woo films, and there\\'s barely a drop of blood despite countless explosions.  Blood is a good thing in the John Woo movies, but Hollywood doesn\\'t like it.The plot couldn\\'t power a KIA up Beverly Hills, and Tom Cruise could barely push it.For all the threat to the entire world (of course they never talk about the Greek myth that is the namesake of the threat), you are never really scared. And the ending is pure Hollywood.Yuck.\"', '\"When the movie started, I was grab into the movie. The vision, Paul Walker, and the cast was dramatic. Everything was perfect, but the only problem was that I thought that the movie was cut and cut so much that the movie wasn\\'t exactly portray liked I thought it was. I knew the plot, but the people who edit this movie cut out so many wonderful parts and takes that the movie was more liked rated G (no sex just a bunch of drama). One comment, PAUL WALKER looks good!! Really good!!!! He was the part that made me came to see this film!! My friends were screaming and yelling, \"He\\'s so hot\" during the movie!! I couldn\\'t stopped them from disrupting the others who were there. The cars were phat! What I don\\'t liked about it was how it portray the Asian people. We\\'re not liked that!! WE\\'re not slutty, pervert, nor  evil (well, most of us aren\\'t). That was the only part I was offended by. The way they made the Asian people dress was so entirely gross. I mean I can\\'t even think they think we\\'re liked that!! Anyways, the movie went by so fast, I didn\\'t even see Paul Walker get any \"action\" with Jordana Brewster. It was a shame that the writers didn\\'t really get into the \"Brian Mia\\'s relationship\" because I thought that that was an interesting \"part\" to know. Well, anyway, the movie was awesome, the cars were da bomb, and it has incredible special effect. For those that didn\\'t saw it, go see it for the action, cars, or my personal favorite, Paul Walker. He look so hot and so damn sexy in that movie!! He will totally take your breathed away!!!\"', '\"Dear Drew: I know from the credits you are one of the \"producers\" of this film.  If you were paid a lot of money for this \"fluff\" movie, OK. Now, please, never make another movie where you \"share\" the female lead role equally in an ensemble team-concept like Charlie\\'s Angels.  Also, don\\'t accept roles where you have no meaningful speaking lines.  Uttering two-line cue card dialog between scene takes is not \"serious acting.\"  You are capable of carrying a complete movie feature as the solo actress and your lines should be spoken in meaningful paragraphs rather than \"Valley-Teen DUH words.\"  Now, I know it was fun for the three \"karate-expert\" Angels to make this film.  OK.  You have gotten it out of your system.  Let\\'s get back to some serious acting.  You are lovely in costume period roles!  Enjoy being the fairy princess that you are!Having John Forsythe\\'s voice as in the original Charlie\\'s Angels TV series is a necessity.  I am old enough to know what he really looks like.  Many women, today, would swoon over him if he were as young now as he was back in the  middle of the last century.  Having Bill Murray in the Bosley role was acceptable.  Of course, it\\'s a better movie when Bill Murray is the star and has the entire movie to display his unique brand of comedy.  Tim Curry played the role of a not-so really bad guy with a sense of comedy well.  No adverse criticism here.  He is always a good character actor.  He lends class to any movie he appears in.For the rest of the male actors, sorry, you were completely forgetable once the film was over.  It\\'s amazing that all these beautiful lady-stars are so young and have such amazing karate/martial arts skills.  Even all the bad guys are karate trained!  If an average person were kicked in the chest or head even once, they would be rendered unconscious or incapable of getting up to fight another round!  Unbelievable!In the original Charlie\\'s Angels the gals were not so high-tech.  They used their powers of deductive reasoning, femininity, and race-car driving ability to win the day.  Here, it seems that the new era of Angels have to have all-kinds of engineering degrees to complete the mission.   And - they speak Asian languages, to boot!  Unbelievable. Cameron Diaz seemed too silly in her role to be taken seriously.  Although it was nice seeing her \"shake her booty\" during the Soul Train scene.  Lucy Liu seemed lost trying to be the serious-minded Angel. \\nAnd, for all their powers and sophistication, the Angels had a \"love interest\" that was beneath their intelligence level.  The original Charlie\\'s Angels would not jeopardize their mission by falling \"gaga\" for some unlikely \"hunk.\"  Not a good choice, movie writers, for having the girls in bed with guys during the course of completing the \"mission\" for Charlie. \\nAlthough the director was shown on Cinemax, prior to a recent TV showing, making self-praise for his first full length directing feature, he should take the money and run and not bore the viewing audience with self-aggrandizement.  For, it was not earned with this film.The double meaning, gratuitous, phallic symbol sex joke exchange between characters Roger Corwin and Alex Munday at the massage table was in poor taste.  Cheap trick suitable for late-night cable standup comics but not for a PG-13 general release movie!Sure, watch it just to see the pretty girls as this is what we are supposed to do with Charlie\\'s Angels.  And, don\\'t believe anything about the movie from that point on!\"', '\"The sequel is not as good as the original...  Found story to be confusing to follow and Will Smith almost tries too hard to be sarcastically serious. Lara is hot but the Pug stole the picture.  There were some funny lines and the special effects were pretty cool.  Go see it but don\\'t expect too much!!!\"', '\"This movie kicked some serious ass to the max :)  People keep saying it had a bad plot and all...it didn\\'t...everyone that said that is probably over the age of 25 or married  or something. I recommend this movie to all the peeps out there under 21 and over 12!\"', '\"This is really a feast for the eye and ear of people that like cars. One shouldn\\'t expect too much of the story; but hey: one does get an awful lot of extremely good looking streetcars from the beginning until the end! Recommended for car-freaks!\"', '\"OK, so it\\'s just eye candy, mostly appealing to horny teenage boys, but the \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" movie is pretty neat. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu reprise the roles of the 1970s crime-fighting babes. This was one of the only movies based on a TV show to get it right (a far cry from \"The Flintstones\", \"I Spy\" and \"Bewitched\"). Maybe it was Bill Murray\\'s neat characterization of Bosley, but this is definitely a movie worth seeing - although I heard that the sequel was one of the worst movies ever made.Anyway, you\\'re sure to enjoy this movie. It\\'s more proof of the talents of all involved. Also starring Sam Rockwell, Kelly Lynch, Tim Curry, Crispin Glover, Luke Wilson, John Forsythe, Matt LeBlanc, Tom Green and LL Cool J.\"', '\"This is an excellent must see movie. I dont understand how people can not like this film it is shot very well, and it has great action adventure scenes. I think it has been easily the best film of 2000. Buy it on DVD. It has an excellent soundtrack, excellent, theme, and a lot of fun. Watch it now and avoid all negative comments.\"', '\"Definitely Frank the pug steals the show in this sequel to the 1997 blockbuster.  Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith go back and forth and they are supported by a good cast and fun.  Mind you no one in the movie will get a best actor nod and the story is fine but it is a fun picture.  Rosario Dawson is cute, but who can out play Frank the pug, nobody!!!\"', '\"Oh dear, oh dear, it is sad that James Bond has come to this. I can see why they had to reboot the series in Casino Royale.While I think that it is the worst film in the Bond series it isn\\'t totally rubbish, the opening scene where Bond surfs in to North Korea at night, infiltrates an arms deal then tries to escape in a spectacular hovercraft chase is top notch for a start.Sadly things then go down hill when Bond is captured, during the credits we see Bond being tortured while we are tortured by the worst ever Bond-song. A year later he is freed in a prisoner exchange. He is soon chasing those responsible for his incarceration going to Cuba where we have a subtle joke when Bond picks up a copy of \"Birds of the West Indies\" by James Bond... after whom Ian Flemming named the character. Here he meets CIA agent Jinx, played less than well by Halle Berry although that may be largely down to the script. He then heads to London looking to find a connection between conflict diamonds (issue of the moment) and Gustav Graves who claims to have found diamonds in Iceland.He is soon off to Iceland with fellow agent Miranda Frost, who is undercover in Graves\\' organisation, played by the excellent Rosamund Pike. Equipped with possibly the most ridiculous gadget in any Bond film, a car that can become totally invisible.Of course it turns out that Graves is doing more than trading conflict diamonds, he is using them to power a satellite based weapon. As things get more and more over the top we see Bond surfing once more, this time however it is a very tacky CGI scene and a finale aboard an aircraft that seems to be able to fly despite being on fire and most of the wing surface missing.\"', '\"The movie is superb.excellent plot.hats- off to Hollywood directors.Danny oceans character and his master mind is really do amazing.i want even Telugu\\'s directors to make movies like this.brad Pitts action is also nice.the way the director spun the plot is amazing.i need to tell you that this is one of the best heist films i had ever seen.Gracia\\'s.please carry on on making these type of films.

Unbelievable stunts.  Keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.  Few boring moments.  Makes you think of a high tech James Bond, mixed with a little MacGyver.  I really enjoyed this one! Perhaps it has a little to do with the Cruise charm as well.  Great directing by Woo as well.\"', '\"I was concerned that John Woo making a sequel to Mission Impossible II would overshadow the MI \"brand\" as it were.  Luckily I was right.  This movie is all Woo.  A beautiful piece of celluloid.Honestly, if you\\'re looking for the MI of De Palma days, you\\'re not going to get it.  What you\\'ll find here is intense slow motion, the odd white dove and of course the most insane, double gun clutching, I\\'ll-take-a-whole-army-of-you-lot action.  At times I was worried that Mr Woo had missed the whole point, but I found myself extremely happy, letting out cries of \"wicked\", \"oh yeah\" and more \"oh yeah\"s.This is a truly beautiful film.\"', '\"With a new Shaft movie out right now, I thought I\\'d review all the previous Shaft movies and TV shows before that and I managed to see each one except eps 4 and 5 of the TV version because of a cracked disc. Richard Roundtree plays the same role as before but he\\'s not the main character here. Samuel L. Jackson as his same-named nephew is. Roundtree only appears in a few scenes in relation to Jackson but he makes them count. In this one, a rich white guy gets bail after killing a black man he harassed earlier. His only witness was a white waitress who later disappears. Jackson as Shaft is looking for her. I\\'ll stop there and just say this was quite a thrilling revival of the character though it didn\\'t lead to another sequel until now. Nice to see original director Gordon Parks in one scene with Jackson as well as once again hearing Issac Hayes\\' version of the theme song, rerecorded for this movie. The late director John Singleton did a nice tribute to that 1971 film. So now I\\'m anxious to see the current one with Singleton and Rountree out right now...\"', '\"Long on violence, short on sense and entirely devoid of sex, Â‘Shaft\\' is now doing the rounds of UK terrestrial television Â– and has thus, perhaps, finally found the medium to which it is best suited. For this really is small screen stuff, not so much an artful re-rendering of the original Richard Roundtree hit as a frame without a canvas, a great gaping hole of a movie into which Samuel L Jackson disappears, seemingly never to re-emerge except as a gibbering wreck in commercials for Barclays Bank.It might be thought that this is one of the few movies best experienced with eyes shut Â– because thankfully, the Isaac Hayes soundtrack is as wonderful as ever Â–  but unfortunately, this Â‘Shaft\\' is decked out with so many obligatory expletives as to induce tedium after ten minutes\\' acquaintance. So it\\'s probably sensible not to bother listening to it, either.If memory serves aright, the original Shaft was some kind of Â‘sex machine\\'. In this version, Jackson is, er, just some kind of machine. Sex is out, and with it all the vitality of the original.Slaughter, though, is in Â– except here, it\\'s on such an improbable scale that the Â‘s\\' can usefully be dropped: given the way that he survives even the densest hail of bullets, this Shaft is someone who can obviously walk through a monsoon without getting wet.The plot, such as it is, has this Shaft quitting the police force to team up with the Â‘old\\' Shaft. Or maybe he doesn\\'t quit Â– the screenplay\\'s amnesiac qualities are such that it seems wholly incapable of remaining coherent from one set-up to the next. Still, either as a private citizen or as a cop, the new Shaft is something to see: a foul-mouthed sexless mass murderer, one whose prescription for the world\\'s ills is to beat into a pulp all those who he hasn\\'t actually shot dead. Well, there\\'s a role model if ever there was.. .Quite what director / screenwriter John Singleton thought he was attempting with this remake isn\\'t clear, because a Â‘black movie\\' it ain\\'t. Owing nothing at all to black culture, it\\'s about as streetwise as a fifty year old copy of an A to Z.Rating: null points.\"', '\"Overall: A fun, intelligent caper which is good for most of the family.Good: A smart, fun intelligent caper featuring a star studded cast each performing to new heights. Unlikeable villain that makes your root for the thieves.Bad: Some parts of the plan feel pointless and there is quite a lot of luck involved in it.Best Part: The kind of ridiculous albeit entertaining grand reveal of how they did it.9/10Would recommend to watch.\"', '\"Shanghai Noon is probably Chan\\'s best work.  The humor is outstanding and speaking from a martial arts perspective, ol\\' Jackie may be getting a little long in the tooth but he\\'s still got the moves!This is a *great* movie!\"', '\"This film has everything(as many have said)that Gone in 60 seconds doesn\\'t have including chases , races and all out style.

Better Than Any Bond Movie and Much better Than the 1960 Version. Recommended for Everyone. 10 out of 10.\"', '\"This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I have no desire to read the book either because I am not into this kind of stuff but my brother in law told me it was one of the best movies I would ever see so I gave it a try. I was so bored I am surprised I even got through it. It is slow moving and the climax is very disappointing. This movie was a waste of time. I bought it at a pawn shop for $2.50. I will have to stick it in a yard sale and get rid of this worthless movie. I thought there would be some good exciting scenes but the whole movie was just boring. There is never an entertaining part in the whole movie. If this movie is entertaining to some I would like to know how so.\"', '\"This remake of the late 70s/early 80s television show of the same name is somewhat of a guilty pleasure for many more than just me. In \"Charlie\\'s Angels\", Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu (with support of Bill Murray) plays a trio of femme fatales, equipped not only with physics bending fighting skills but also with sexyness. While the film\\'s plot is unoriginal and pretty sloppy, its self awareness and spoofy approach to the action genre makes \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" an early 2000s cult classic, as it is completely watchable almost two decades later.\"', '\"By the time the initial credits were finishing, I was already thinking \"what am I doing here?\". It\\'s sad to see so much production money spent in a movie that doesn\\'t have a single positive feature.Go and see it only if you are a fan of the girls and don\\'t mind what\\'s coming out of their mouths...\"', '\"I loved <i>Goldeneye</i>, and I loved <i>Tomorrow Never Dies</i>.  Both excellent films, not just for Bond movies, but enjoyable, well made movies in general.  <i>The World Is Not Enough</i> left me cold, but I thought it was just a fluke and expected <i>Die Another Day</i> to be much better.  It was in fact much, much worse.Don\\'t get me wrong.  The fight scenes are well choreographed, and the special effects where largely top notch.  (However, the CGI looked like CGI, and that is definitely a bad thing.  I\\'ve seen home video games with more realistic graphics.)What got me was that we had got down to the big climatic fight scene at the end, and it occurred to me that I didn\\'t give a rat\\'s ear who won.  It could\\'ve been Bond.  It could\\'ve been the bad guy.  I was completely apathetic.  You see, in a good story, the audience is led into developing an emotional attachment to the protagonist.  When it\\'s done right, it is a subtle thing that lends depth to the character.  When it\\'s not done wrong, it\\'s a maudlin cartoonish mess.  The characters in <i>DAD</i> where 2 dimensional caricatures, and despite all the action and violence in the final fight scene, I was yawning and looking at my watch.This is two poorly told (and therefore poorly written) Bond movies in a row, and checking the IMDB, I see that both of those were written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade.  This is a team with very little experience, and apparently very little ability.  If those two are involved in the next Bond film, I\\'ll pass, thank you.\"', '\"Steve Soderbergh has taken a complete turn of events from his Erin Brockovich & Traffic days, and gone back to the style and fun of \"Out of Sight\" with Ocean\\'s Eleven.

No it doesn\\'t.Since we all know what the movie about (always about drugs) and who is in it, I\\'ll cut to the chase what Bad Boys II actually offer the viewer: Bad Boys II doesn\\'t have much of the story into it. It is like 80% action and 20% substance. And 80% in two and the half hour Â– trust me, that was way too much. It even bored me at time. With never ending cars chase, and fighting, and when you thought it is finish it goes on and on and on differences places just like Speed 1 and 2.Don\\'t get me wrong, Bad Boys II is an action pack film and I do enjoy watching it. But it has lost its style, humor and sophistication cause too much of something that bad and this time Â– too much action.Recommendation: A Real Action Movie Lover Would Have Like It. But I Don\\'t.Rating: 5.5/10 (Grade: C-) Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It Â– Thanks\"', '\"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The idea of street racing is cool, because I personally do it and I love it, but this movie totally blew it\\'s potential.  Not only that, it\\'s a huge rip off of \"Point Break.\"  An undercover cop, trying to get the inside on these street racers who are suspected to be robbing 18-wheelers, while falling in love with the girl who is on the side of the street racers.  That rite there is a horrible plot and should\\'ve been tossed at the site of that garbage.  There were also many other things wrong with the film. First, you see the driver\\'s using nitrous on their rice burning cars like 4 or 5 times in a single race.  That is almost not even possible because the Japanese cars they are using can\\'t take that kind of pressure on the engine block.  They could last about 2 shots of nitrous, maybe 3, before their engine block blew up and/or cracked, or before you had to do a complete rebuild of the engine, both top-end and bottom-end construction.Secondly, when they race at the beginning, they do a mile long race, which no idiot would do because to determine the winner, all you really need to race is a quarter of a mile. And lastly, the movie would have been a tremondous amount better if they used AMERICAN CARS!!!!!!  All these \"new age\" racers nowadays try to supe up their Honda Civics and their Eclipse\\'s, and none of them were designed to race and none of them could ever compete with the kind of power an AMERICAN CAR could put out.The only two cars in the film that are worth any respect are the Ford Lightning, that doesnt even see the drag strip, which is stupid considering that it does a 10 second quarter-mile which is damn good, and the Dodge Challenger, which THANK GOD is raced, cuz if it wasnt i would have killed myself, but sadly ends up being destroyed by that idiot Vin Diesel.  At that point, i was getting ready to cry, and then shoot myself, but luckily the movie ended.\"', '\"The only good things about this movie (besides Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones\\' acting) were the dog, and a few of the special FX scenes. Other than that it was mostly recycled material from the original, hastily put together, below-average plot line, and a very unsatisfying ending. Looks like the movie was made by a studio \"suit\" in order to make money, and not a real writer in order to make a good film. Save your money; rent the first one again.\"', '\"You\\'d think Samuel L. Jackson starring in a remake of Shaft would be the coolest thing ever. Seeing as Jackson and the character are two badass mother-shut yo mouths. But the end result is disappointing.The plot revolves around Shaft, played by Jackson, seeking to take down the son of a wealthy and powerful man. The son is played by Christian Bale, and the reason Shaft is after him is because he murdered a black man out of racial hate. But he managed to escape prison time and fled to Switzerland. Shaft gets sick,of the injustice and hands in his badge, taking a vigilante approach. His only hope is finding the lone witness of the murder and convince her to take the stand.Here\\'s the film\\'s main problem. The actions he takes are not protected by the law. The cops are even helping him, and no consequences are paid. True, you want him to win, but you can\\'t overlook he is breaking the law. The original Shaft was more of a lone wolf. Shaft here can\\'t seem to do anything without help.The films villains are forgettable. As good as Bale is, he\\'s hardly there and is out of the majority of the action. Jeffrey Wright as a Hispanic gangster emerges as the main villain and is utterly uninteresting. A great villain should make you like him, even if you hate him. I don\\'t even remember the character\\'s name.But I think the biggest downfall is casting Richard Roundtree in a reprisal of his original Shaft role and waste him. He\\'s pretty much a cameo and the film ends with a promise of the original badass mother-shut yo mouth kicking some ass, but we don\\'t get to see it.The one thing this film needed was to be cool. It\\'s unfortunately not.Shaft 4/10\"', '\"Steven Soderbergh\\'s \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" is the best heist film I\\'ve ever seen. It is directed with great flair and style. It is also great fun to watch. The acting is terrific all around. This is George Clooney\\'s best movie. This is Soderbergh\\'s second best film behind \"Traffic.\" (***1/2 out of ****)\"', '\"I wanted to walk out on this movie, but it was showing in my living room. Actually, I did walk out, to use the bathroom. My wife asked if I wanted to pause the playback and I told her there was no need.What chemistry and humor there was in the first movie is forced in this one. And for such a flimsy premise as this, why was it so long?Just way overdone and a waste of everyone\\'s creative energy.\"', '\"Sometimes I\\'m constantly amazed to read reviews by people who have so obviously gone to a movie they either didn\\'t want to watch or knew wouldn\\'t really interest them. To these people, I say give your money to charity or something, I\\'ve never understood those people who have so little to do in their life that they go and see every movie ever made then complain about 90% of them. Life is like that, I happen to think Star Wars sucks, so when a new Star Wars movie comes out, you know what?! I DON\\'T go and see it! TF&TF is like this. For those who enjoy cars...no let me rephrase that, for those who love cars, this is a great film. It really makes \"Gone in 60 seconds\" look like an excuse of a car film - they raid a Ferrari garage and we see about 5 seconds of actual DRIVING? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING! Not so in The Fast and The Furious, thankfully. The riced out cars may not be to everyone\\'s tastes, but owning a powerful turbo vehicle myself, they actually captured my imagination with the audio - the vehicles sounded immaculate with audible induction noise, blow off valves and sweet exhaust notes throughout the movie. The black muscle-car near the end of the movie absolutely thundered in Dolby delight in my cinema, and was awe inspiring. With a decent home theatre setup at home, not much impresses me these days but I was blown away by the audio at most times in this film. It reminded me why I still bother going to the cinema. Visually the movie was fine, the stunts were well executed and the camera angles engaging. You don\\'t go to an action movie to see involving dialog, you go to remove yourself from reality and have a damn good time doing it, and I felt TF&TF did this well. The fact it was about a subject close to my heart (cars) just added to my personal like for the film. My wife, who dislikes a lot of films I enjoy, also loved the film - which surprised me seeing it was so obviously a male oriented film. Yes the plot was a bit weak, the dialog a bit shabby at times, and the acting a bit forced. The corny \"I live my life a quarter mile at a time\" was almost laughable, but taken in context was bearable. But at the end of the day, this was a fantastic movie for car freaks - the same crowd who will spend $50 on specialised videos JUST about cars, with no plot, no Dolby surround, no multi-million dollar budget. If you take this movie for what it is, a fast action romp around the car racing scene, then it does its job admirably IMHO. I think those thoughts are backed up by the huge haul it has done at the box office, and I\\'m even thinking of seeing it again, something I\\'ve not done since I was a stupid teenager :) Go see it, and grab it on DVD - I know I will.\"', '\"This is first movie of the Fast & Furious franchise it has a solid plot and a nice finish scene which leave place for next movie. It\\'s a great movie for all, especially for car lovers. Movie is full of tuned cars, hot girls and races. Old school street racing (1/4 of a mile, NOS in cars). Cars like Toyota Supra, Honda Civic and American classic Charger. It is nice treat for all car lovers. When you hear that engine sound and that NOS boost you just wanna get there and race. Racing and chasing is pretty much realistic. But movie is not all about racing it gives connection between main characters that will last trough other movies. It is very underrated movie. I rated it 8 cause of his lack of action. It has nice plot so you won\\'t get bored at all but there is something missing. All in all I recommend this movie for everyone who is interested in cars you will enjoy it.\"', '\"The writers committee has managed to suck the mojo out of this Bond film. It takes over 2 hours to get to the end of this souless action template. Between the action there\\'s lots of turgid dialogue and a weak excuse for a plot. It\\'s like a porno where you want to fast forward to the good bits but they just never come. This isn\\'t the worst or the best of Bond films. I think best or worst lists are stupid. Top ten lists are for simple people who eat Big Macs and want others do their thinking for them. Each film has a different context and judgement criteria.DAD looks like a Bond film, it sounds like a Bond film but after 2 hours it\\'s a pretty stale rerun - you\\'ve seen most of this film before in other films and it has nothing new to add to the formula. Have you ever tried to chew on a second hand gum and hope there\\'s still some flavour left? See this film if you want to know what it\\'s like.Some people refer to this as `homage\\' - I think it\\'s just lazy copying of your homework and a lack of imagination.The things that bring this film down are the lack of credibility and quality of the action - as the two are intertwined. The removal of credibility results in the removel of jeopardy in the action. If Bond is near invincible then there is no tension in the action apart from a series of pretty, flavourless explosion spectacles that mark the current American action film market. As we all know, Bond films ride the tightrope between fantasy/spectacle and reality. In this case DAD has fallen heavily on the side of fantasy at the expense of suspense and jeopardy.<SPOILER BIT HERE>The story tries to have it both ways with credibility. At the start of this film we actually see Bond as fallible - he gets caught and tortured by the bad guys. This brings Bond down to earth and almost makes him believable as a gritty character. The next thing we know he\\'s jumping into his Astin Martin Vanquish car that is INVISIBLE and he\\'s driving it to the bad guys\\' lair, a Big Mac Opera House that is entirely made of ice. He is subsequently greeted by Dr Evil who has just come in on his rocket powered sled.The credibility that they are so eager to establish at the start amounts to nothing - why did they bother?<END OF SPOILER BIT>Apart from a car chase scene and an over the top sword fight there is very little tension to give Bond a real challenge. The bad guys practially fall over each other in their eagerness to get killed by Bond and Jinx.It looks like the production team are taking a page from the Sylvester Stallone school of script writing - think up all the action scenes then make up some lame excuses for a plot to link them together then add water and shake.Has Bond gone Pearl Harbour on us? When out of ideas add more explosions and if that sucks just make bigger ones - don\\'t bother with any suspense just enjoy the CGI and laugh it up. There\\'s a difference between something innovative or witty and just absurd. Bond is starting to look more and more like it\\'s wannabe competitors, like XXX. If they are not careful people will forget what the difference is between a Bond film and  all the other crass action flicks out there. As a humble suggestion to any future writers out there: Concentrate on quality rather than quantity and relying on post production CGI to cover up the lack of plot with big planes, explosions and multiple frikin\\' laserbeams.Jacy Teh (Licenced to whine)\"', '\"When people tell you this is a bad movie, you think, \"it can\\'t be that bad\", IT IS!!!!!   It\\'s like bad chinese food, you\\'re not sure if you\\'re going to be sick afterwards.  People were leaving the theatre it was so bad.  The plot was weak at best and the \"action scenes\" were straight out of Miami Vice, but without Don Johnson to make it interesting.Overblown hype, overblown Cruise and blown money for the ticket.\"', '\"Roger Ebert once wrote that there are \"good\" bad movies and there are \"bad\" bad movies.   But once in a while there comes along a truly \"great\" bad movie--a B-picture so desperately trying to claw it\\'s way out of the confines of it\\'s genre that you have to give it credit for nothing if not sheer guts.To call Rob Cohen\\'s \"The Fast and the Furious\" a \"great\" bad movie is a heady compliment indeed.  There have been many attempts at films with similar subject matter that simply fall into the category of \"bad\" good movies (with Renny Harlin\\'s recent car wreck \"Driven\" coming to mind as a picture of great means yet dubious end).  The tale of rival street racers in Los Angeles, \"The Fast and the Furious\" sets itself apart with a strong sense of style and thoroughly exciting racing sequences.In his past works, director Rob Cohen has displayed a journeyman-like quality behind the camera, making very professional, albeit serviceable films that have never been able to free themselves from the manacles of genre (\"Dragonheart\" and \"Daylight\" are but two such examples).  But in \"The Fast and the Furious\" Cohen brings a heretofore unseen visual panache to the proceedings, turning a film that could have been a mindless exercise in action histrionics into an exciting, sardonic (yet admittedly still mindless) ride.The film worked for me on a very visceral level, and the expert camera and effects-work were aided by a first-rate sound mix that added a great deal of intensity to the whole affair.  Vin Diesel gives a performance that is all steely-eyed machismo and throaty growls in the place of syllabic speech. But it\\'s a perfect fit for Paul Walker, who strikes all of the right chords in a role meant to register, I suppose, as Keanu-Lite.\\nAudiences will scratch their heads as motivations shift, loyalties twist, and logic is all but beaten into submission, but \"The Fast and the Furious\" is undeniably entertaining.  It is garbage of the highest order, a ridiculously fun pastiche of genres, stock characters, and well-made set pieces.You may be groaning at the film\\'s idiocy, you may be cringing at it\\'s over-the-top action, but I can almost guarantee that you\\'ll have a smile on your face while doing it.\"', '\"I don\\'t understand why you say this is an awful Bond film?? Each film in the Bond series must keep ahead of the times. It\\'s all about technology and imagination, and I find that this film displays excellent examples of both. If the Bond series kept repeating itself, it would be rather boring and predictable, now wouldn\\'t it? And another thing, why should the gadgets in the film be believable?? In case you forgot, this happens to be 007. It\\'s not SUPPOSED to be believable, it\\'s fantasy entertainment for Pete\\'s sake! Get a grip. Might I also add that the Bond Girls in this film are drop dead gorgeous...Halle and Rosamund-I Love You!\"', '\"This movie is perhaps one of the best heist films made in recent years. The guys are the epitome of cool and they manage to rob 160 million dollars all while bantering and wearing suits. It is a movie where you should just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride, because from the very beginning the smart dialog and fast pace will have you hooked. The cast is very well done. There is Danny played by Clooney who after leaving jail goes to find right hand man, Rusty (Pitt) with a master plan. Rusty has perhaps the funniest lines of the film. Matt Damon plays the pickpocket. Elliot Gould the financier; Carl Reiner the veteran; Don Cheadle the man who does the explosives; Julia Roberts is the hidden agenda and then there is the rest of the supporting cast that makes this movie a true success. (P.S. The two bickering brothers (Cann and Affleck) are worth the price of admission alone)\"', '\"Starts off extremely boring and lame, trying to be cool all the while. Eventually it becomes entertainment but that\\'s less than half the movie. It\\'s basically just \"star power\", trying to be cool, and a waste of 2 hours.\"', '\"This movie was, overall very enjoyable.  It also provided plenty of laughs. The acting was good, especially the supporting actors, though I dont think this movie really had a lead.  The plot is ok, though a little farfetched ( pulling of that heist with only 2 weeks planning).  The ending could have been a little better, like having a scene with the whole crew together.       One thing about the movie that annoyed me was the camera work.  That nearly ruined the film.  There were some scenes where I was getting dizzy watching the movie.  Aside from that, I enjoyed the film thoroughly.\"', '\"This film (That i was DRAGGED to by my friends) was an entire 180 from what i thought it was going to be. I figured, \"Fast cars and the losers who race them\" I got a semi-intelligent film with perfect casting and a well thought out story line. the film dipped into some overdone effects in the first race but afterwards it was great.The film really hits home with the casting and dialogue, the whole film has a feel like they just set the camera down in the middle of the street racing scene and every line feels improvised. (Which i found out on the DVD that many of the lines were). it raises itself just above the typical \"Teen\" movie but still keeps true to that youthful genre. I hated cars before i saw this film, I never thought anything about racing or about cars in general and i thought only idiot greese monkeys touched them for fun, now i\\'ve souped up my cutlass supreme and race almost every week.\"', '\"This was a movie that kind of confused me as a kid in that this was one of the first movies I saw where the protagonists commit a crime. I remember asking my dad, \"so these are the bad guys?\" His response was along the lines of \"well, they may be stealing something but they\\'re still the good guys.\" I still liked the movie as a kid, but this concept confused me a little bit. Many years later, it is still a delightful B movie to watch.It is pretty awesome that they have so many people on their team to create an ensemble cast, but some of them get barely any screen time when I would want to see an equal balance of the cast. For example, all we know about the little acrobat is that he is really good at what he does since he doesn\\'t speak much English, besides dropping the second use of \"f***\" in the movie. We also don\\'t delve too deep into the back story of certain characters, such as the oldest member on the team. We know all of these guys either have a connection to Ocean or Pitt\\'s character or that they are found, and for this senior citizen we know he has a connection to Pitt\\'s character and that is about it.The funniest bits of the film come from the twins, one of whom is played by Casey Affleck, who really gets how annoying his character is supposed to be. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Affleck\\'s character\\'s toy car is going faster than his brother\\'s monster truck just to get destroyed by his brother.Getting back to the point of the movie, the heist seems to go way too smoothly, which is meant to satisfy the viewers I guess, but a great film requires conflict - no matter if it is external or internal - but this film\\'s struggle seems mainly to be internal struggles within Ocean and his enemy played by Andy Garcia. One is trying to win his ex- wife back, and the other is dying inside as his money is getting stolen. As Brad Pitt\\'s character points out, it is really selfish of Ocean to concoct this plan with some motivation to win Tess back. Romance makes a good subplot in movies - in fact a lot of producers want at least some type of romance in their movies - and while it holds up and illustrates that Ocean is a better man than Garcia\\'s character, but it seems to stray from the focus on the rest of the team.While watching this my friends were pointing out how gadgets in this movie go unexplained, especially for a film released in 2001 where this type of technology wasn\\'t even in many James Bond films. Each step of the plan seems to go almost too well, with the exception that they almost blow the acrobat away.This is an enjoyable heist film that makes us feel for Ocean, but I wish there was more connection to the other characters in the film.\"', '\"Well, i have seen alot of James Bond movies and i liked them all... But this.. Well, an invisible car? That is so for out... And all the fuss about laserbeams and using the sun to make a deadly weapon, that almost wiped out the Americans.The movie has too many lose ends, its not trust worthy and i was laughing throw the hole movie of all the sillyness.There is one good thing about this movie and that is Halle Barry.\"', '\"The race scene\\'s were the only interesting part, and they weren\\'t all that great. I\\'ve seen better acting on South Park. I was so bored I wanted to fall asleep but the wall of noise managed to keep me awake. If you like racing watch ESPN not this terrible movie.\"', '\"Sure, the movie\\'s got it\\'s problems....but what film doesn\\'t?  This summer\\'s been pretty weak so far, then comes this flick, which entertained me in pretty much every way possible.....Great looking cars, great looking girls, great racing sequences, great stuntwork, and Vin Diesel.  I hope this movie goes over big, and Vin works his way to the top.  He\\'s just the coolest I\\'ve seen on screen this summer.  I found this film very exciting and very entertaining, and judging from the applause at the film\\'s end, so did the rest of the audience....And I didn\\'t see any crappy CGI, either....8/10\"', '\"Sam Jackson plays an acceptable enough SHAFT, actually the nephew of the original, and Uncle Shaft himself (Richard Roundtree) is around for a bit here and a bit there. Shaft has been expelled from the police force, and is hot on the trail of a maniacal killer (Christian Bale in his American PSYCHO mode). Busta Rhymes is along for some comic relief. Actually, the best performance is given by actor/playwright Jeffrey Wright as a fancy-pants drug lord who learns soon enough it doesn\\'t pay to play with Shaft. Unfortunately, the movie lacks enough hard action, and in the end, everyone -- except maybe Wright -- appears to just be going through the motions in this quasi-remake/quasi-sequel to the 1971 cult favorite. A better director might have helped, but the story is so tired. A better film, however, might have resulted in a followup. Too bad. Imagine Jackson in a franchise.\"', '\"I consider this film a big disappointment. I feel there was no chemistry among any of the characters.  The original may have been a better film, if only because the people who starred in the film were known to us as a group so we knew there was already chemistry.  Putting a bunch of stars in a movie does not guarantee that there will be chemistry.  No matter how big the people are, without chemistry the film drags -- and this film drags a lot.\"', '\"Ocean\\'s 11 is another ensemble all-star-cast caper movie.  As such, it is one of the best of that lot, but overall that lot is a sorry lot.  Ocean\\'s 11 reminded most recently of a similar ensemble caper flick of a few year\\'s back, \"Sneakers\" (1992)with Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier.  The reason ensemble cast caper films don\\'t work is that there are too many characters for any of them to get developed in the course of a 2 hour movie.  Both of these films (Ocean\\'s 11 and Sneakers) therefore come off as shallow, undeveloped, and slight.  One of the big attractions of Ocean\\'s 11, that gets us into the theater in the first place, is Julia Roberts, but her character is so poorly developed here that she is little more than window dressing and we never understand her motivations (in fact, she doesn\\'t actually do anything in this movie, when you come right down to it.)  The saving grace of Ocean\\'s 11 is the stylish, sophisticated filmic style brought to it by Steven Soderbergh.  Is is so, so refreshing to see a crime picture without a lot of gunfire.  Still, my wife complained as we left the theater that the film didn\\'t have a climax.  You be the judge--the whole film is a mixed bag that way.\"', '\"An interesting, realistic plot was never Charlie\\'s Angels\\' strong suit. The original series was fun to watch because of its style. This movie follows that same tradition. The Angels brush off physical damage that would kill a 300 pound NFL linebacker, never mind a 120 pound female. But the film has very interesting effects and visuals, lots of humor, and enough charm from all the major characters that it\\'s hard to pay attention to the flimsy plot and unrealistic situations. Some of the fight sequences look very impressive (if very reminiscent of John Woo films), and the Angels have just the right combination of ditziness and kick-ass bad-girl toughness to keep the movie rolling right along. A great film if you want to have a fun time.\"', '\"Lots of cars, lots of people and an all around good plot.Summary: Brian works undercover to find out who has been hijacking a bunch of trucks, that carry around a lot of expensive stuff in them, which draws him to Dom and his crew, who build cars and race them at night with others.I\\'m rating this movie 8/10. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are great in this movie.\"', '\"Ben Affleck is not Jack Ryan.  If I was the president, I wouldn\\'t believe him while trying to avoid war.  There were too many holes in the plot and no Alec Baldwin or Harrison Ford to save us.  Visually the film was stunning and the action kept my interest, but the world was saved in spite of Jack Ryan, not by him.  Get Harrison Ford back.\"', '\"The Fast and the Furious is not a great movie by any means, but it is very entertaining. It\\'s definitely a turn-your-brain-off-for-two-hours flick, a nice popcorn flick. The plot is your basic undercover cop conflicted by his attachment to those he is infiltrating kind of thing. No real surprises here. The acting is quite good. I\\'m putting my money on Vin Diesel becoming the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. Michelle Rodriguez, who was just amazing in last year\\'s Girlfight (she is why I saw this film), is extremely sexy in it. Oh yeah, she gives a good performance, too. I hope she gets some great roles after the success of this movie. The other performers are all relatively good. There aren\\'t any weak spots. The action, which is why most will see The Fast and the Furious, is very good. Although one might wonder why it takes five minutes, even in slow motion, for cars that go 150+ MPH, to travel a quarter of a mile, it doesn\\'t hurt the flick too much. I generally don\\'t like car chase movies. The Mad Max films and this are probably the only exceptions. I was clenching my teeth during several action sequences. 7/10.\"', '\"After watching MiB and then watching this one the next day, I have to say that I\\'m a little bit disappointed. This one did not hold up as well as I thought it would. I wasn\\'t a fan of the story and did not enjoy the villain. It got boring when they had to go on an \"egg hunt\" and retracing the steps. I didn\\'t feel any real stakes which is disappointing when I\\'m watching. The CGI I thought was a step down from the first film. Some of the aliens didn\\'t look as good. Through all of that there were some positives though. I did like Frank and the Worms. I found them very funny and liked some of the lines they had. Also, once again the chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is really good. MiB III is tomorrow so hopefully it closes out the trilogy nicely.\"', '\"I was 13 years old when this movie came out but it was released in India for only 2 weeks and was then pulled out of the theatres. So I didn\\'t get to see it until I got a hold of the DVD. Before I saw the DVD I only watched the trailer of this movie many times. And that just kept on building up the anticipation for me. My friends saw it when it came out and they too were 13 so they kept on telling me that this movie was indecent and had a lot of bad language. But this movie\\'s R-rated what do you expect? Anyways I finally saw this movie and I was so blown away by its action sequences I really did not give a damn about its bad language or its indecency. This movie was a ride that kept me going and I had no clue that 2 and a half hours just went by. The only thing though is that since this movie was more walk and less talk, some parts of the plot just had me puzzled and I wondered what happened to some of the characters.As a kid who grew up in the 90s buddy cop films were very popular, and I just wanna thank Martin and Will for bringing that back into the 2000s with some extra bang.And the soundtrack was tight, especially that song by Fat Joe, Diddy and Dre. Also this movie was one of the reasons why I became a fan of the Miami Heat.All together, if you want to stay at home and still have fun, get Bad Boys 2.\"', '\"Very poor acting, mediocre story... All the action does not make this film any more interesting or valuable. I am glad I did not have to pay for such junk at the movies. The film is a total disappointment, I\\'d say.\"', '\"Sum seemed to require this viewer to take a lot for granted unlike previous Clancy thrillers.  I didn\\'t have to suspend reality watching Red October, Patriot Games or Clear and Present Danger.  The flow was natural and logical.  In this film, Ryan popped from heroic scene to heroic scene with ease and the viewer had to take his good luck on faith (finding Cabot, surviving the copter, etc.).  Did not hang together as well.  I also was unable to believe that Ryan had found the fountain of youth.  I could accept Ford stepping in for Baldwin, but had trouble believing Affleck could have the access and credibility given his age and peers in the film.\"', '\"This movie boasts a reasonably believable storyline which is more than what one can except from recent BOND movies. The acting is decent and the characterization is excellent. The movie moves at a good pace and it puts bond right back in his original stead of being a spy. This is a guilty pleasure for the discernible viewer because eventhough formulaic it is great entertainment. For the first time in years, it\\'s good to see Bond getting down to his \\'real\\' business, spying that is. Brosnan undoubtedly is the best since Connery. His Bond is darker, edgier, sharper, rasher and at the same time niftier and more suave. The movie has an awesome car chase scene, I mean how often do you get to see a HOT FULLY LOADED V8 ASTON MARTIN FOLLOWED BY A JAGUAR . The hovercraft chase and the gadgets are also cool. The only place where the movies falls of are the pathetic FX, like in the climatic airplane sequence as well as the surfing one. Overall it\\'s a good way to kill 2 hours. Highly recommended for BOND FANS AND ACTION BUFFS\"', '\"We\\'ve seen the plot many times before--can even sense what is coming next. Yet, the money spent in writing/screen-play; where film was set; costumes; level of directorial expertise--etc--carries this film along where many another would have faltered. Others here have commented about the plot, so what follows focuses on the actors: Morgan Freeman shows us again how powerful an actor he is--and he carries the film. Ben Affleck is just starting out in major roles here, and shows it. He is engaging.. but not an actor yet. CiarÃ¡n Hinds as Nemerov was unbelievable, both physically and in terms of how he approached the role (to me, anyway); Ron Rifkin over-emoted-as usual; however, Bridget Moynahan was fine--stood out in what was just a stock role. Other oft-used character actors do their stuff. Philip Baker Hall was really bad here--over-acting and pulling the pace of the film out of whack.To me, this film was fine for a rainy afternoon. Nothing great--but good enough to put the popcorn in the microwave.\"', '\"\"It was good, but the book was better.\"  You hear this so many times that it gets annoying, but most of the time it\\'s true.  Hearing about this movie made be think this even before I saw it, but that\\'s just because I knew the chronology of the novels wouldn\\'t be followed as it should.  The movie as a whole was very good, but I\\'ve been long awaiting the next Tom Clancy novel adapted to movie.  I was leery of Ben Affleck being cast as Jack Ryan, but it fit pretty well with the movie, and Morgan Freeman was a great addition to the Jack Ryan story.  The problem I have with the movie is that it neither follows the timeline of Clancy\\'s novels nor an adapted-for-movie timeline created by only a few of the novels getting chosen to be movies. The novel is older than the other\\'s made into movies (PATRIOT GAMES & CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER), so it makes sense for Jack Ryan to be younger... but the novel is also about a different time of unrest in world history.  This would have all made sense in the movie if it had indeed been a prequel, but it isn\\'t.  The story tries to combine an early chapter in Ryan\\'s life with a modern story/timeline.   The vagueness of references to the other movies is a way of drawing attention away from this discrepancy, so you can just get into the movie.   It\\'s a good watch, though, and relevant to current world affairs.  It\\'s exciting, suspenseful, well written, and despite the inaccuracies with the timeline, it\\'s pretty accurate in it\\'s technical aspects & fun to watch.\"', '\"Ohh God!!.. they finally hit bottom.  This is the most stupid film I have ever seen... bad jokes, re-used special effects, silly plot... If you saw Mission Impossible you already know the plot of Charlie\\'s Angels... and if you saw Matrix, you know the visual effects and fight scenes already.  When I went to the cinema to watch this movie, I did it because the idea of Charlie\\'s Angels on big screen sounded appealing.. but I must say I regret I paid those $4.  Most people at the cinema had to leave before the movie finished... I heard a few people laughing, not at the jokes, but at the silliness of this production... This is not entertainment, it was more like torture\"', '\"Never in a million years would I, sitting in the cinema (with my mum and stepfather, oddly enough) back in 2001, think that the auto-porn I had just witnessed would kick-start a hugely successful franchise due it\\'s seventh instalment next year in 2015. Not that I didn\\'t enjoy the 90 minutes of homoerotic machismo, endless gear-stick changes, scantily-clad gyrators and a cameo by Ja Rule - I actually found it highly entertaining in a Point Break (1991) sort-of-way - it\\'s just that how much of an audience can a film about cars draw? Lots, it would seem.Undercover L.A.P.D. officer Brian O\\'Connor (Paul Walker) is assigned to infiltrate a gang of street-racers led by the notorious Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) after a series of high-speed truck hijackings using pimped-out Honda Civics. A highly competent driver himself, Brian uses his skills to befriend Dominic, while falling for his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). After saving Dominic from the police, Brian earns his respect but not that of his crew, and when Dominic proves himself generous and loyal to those who offer him the same, Brian must choose between protecting his new friend and arresting the criminal he has been assigned to bring down.The Fast and the Furious\\' script is often bad enough to make your ears bleed. This is a film where words of wisdom are offered in the form of \"it\\'s not how you stand by your car, it\\'s how you race your car,\". But it\\'s delivers on what the title promises, and the action scenes are well-staged and it\\'s nice to see real metal bend and break in an increasingly CGI-reliant marketplace. It\\'s loud and often crude, but the two leads of obvious limited acting range prove likable and actually generate some chemistry. It\\'s difficult to say where the franchise will go after the sad death of Paul Walker last year, but this first instalment was a fun, if brainless, start.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com\"', '\"The movie is interesting for the way that it seems to create a new age Bond, however the implementation of this idea is flawed - let us hope that it can be improved in the future.MI2 reads like a new age James Bond - the agent is no longer the tough and stiff upper lip martini kind of guy, but a new age relatively funky and post-modern person reflected through manner, speech, activities, attitudes and so on.The movie draws on multi-culturalism, with its mix of european, australian, american and asian dimensions - the stars, directors and personnel are all from varied backgrounds, and the plot although somewhat thin, contains various cultural elements. Sydney harbour with its Miami speed boat connotations and the almost asian fight sequences are examples of this, and the south african, american, european and australian characters.There are references to contemporary culture and issues: stock options and the internet (unfortunately almost somewhat tacky in its implementation), genetics and killer viruses, and corporatism, etc. The fortunicity of motorbikes on the fortress was also somewhat unbelievable, and the obligatory reference to Atlanta in relationship to Sydney in the context of the 2000 Olympics. I see the character stereotypes, they sort of work, and they are necessary because the genre is necessarily about archetypes and stereotypes, across people and society as a reflection of how it is, and where it is going right now.Filmed in Sydney - my home town - I can see some sort of Australianness in it : sort of less refined, but I can also see an almost post-modernist smirnoff blending of the real and surreal in Woos freeze frame sequences. The sensuality of the lead actress and her new age beauty combined with time blurred impressionistic cinematic sensuality are very seductive.I was actually disappointed, especially because there is a lot of opportunity for a good modernist version of the hero - the sort of new age global playboy rooted in a more relaxed and funky turn of the millennium lifestyle, with a new age heroic story (the ethical dilemmas facing the new world), and contemporary cinematic techniques (e.g. blurring of boundaries between time, space and reality a la smirnoff).Unfortunately it almost seems as though all of this was aimed for, but just couldn\\'t didn\\'t \\'gel\\' together very well -- but perhaps this is a master reflection of contemporary society in the way that it trying to gel and fuse past and the present around the millennial epoch, and how post-millennial society has yet to be fully formed.This resonates particularly deeply for Australia, because as Australia searches for a multicultural identity, it adopts, combines, and mixes all manner of backgrounds into a mix that has yet to congeal.Perhaps in 10 years time, this this perspective will become be apparent in retrospect.\"', '\"An homage to the blaxploitation films of the late \\'60s, early \\'70s, Samuel L. Jackson stars in the title role of \"Shaft\". More of a sequel to the successful earlier series that starred Richard Roundtree than a reboot, it follows the exploits of John Shaft, the nephew of the original detective John Shaft, who is once again portrayed by Roundtree. Shaft is a New York City cop who arrests a racist rich heir (Christian Bale) who beats a black restaurant patron to death for no reason. The heir gets bail and skips town, but returns to years later. Shaft makes it his business to hunt him down. He also is hunting down the sole witness to the murder, who doesn\\'t want to be found. When he finally catches the heir, he is once again given bail, which causes Shaft to quit the force and take measures into his own hands. The heir enlists the aid of a local Hispanic drug lord to hunt down the witness to silence her. This film is VERY relevant to today\\'s ills of society, and the tension between the races that exists today. It also is a throwback to the old series, with MUCH better acting, as Jackson and Bale both command the screen. Good turns by Vanessa Williams as Shaft\\'s partner and Toni Colette as the witness, and a great, over-the-top performance by Jeffrey Wright as the drug lord makes the movie much superior to its predecessors. Great flick for action movie fans.\"', '\"This was a dark movie...while Pierce Brosnan is second only to Sean Connery in his depiction of Bond, the screenplay definitely developed an uncharacteristicly \"un-cool\" 007. Ian Fleming\\'s James Bond is ready for any and all situations, and would definitely NOT be imprisoned for any length of time. This was a very disappointing film...much to much realism in terms of characters and scenarios. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FUN???\"', '\"The only thing you have to know about this film is that it has the Super Bowl taking place in Baltimore. That\\'s right. Super Bowl. Baltimore. That tells you how much thought was put into this giant piece of crap.The plot involves neo-Nazi\\'s who obtain an Israeli nuclear bomb (from an Israeli plane that was shot down in the 1973 Yom Kippur war) and use Russian nuclear scientists to refurbish it, and then ship it to Baltimore (just in time for the Super Bowl) to try to blow up the President of the US.The Nazi\\'s goal is to trick the US into thinking the Russians carried out the attack, hopefully starting a nuclear war which then allows the neo-Nazi\\'s to do what exactly? Take over the smoldering remains of the earth? The movie never adequately explains the rationale behind their actions, since their actions are completely self-defeating. A nuclear exchange between the US and Russia would destroy most of the Western World, leaving precious little left for the Nazi\\'s to rule over. In the novel, Islamic terrorists were the bad guys, which makes sense since they don\\'t care if they live or die and because the Middle East would be relatively unaffected by a nuclear war between Russia and the US. Changing the villains to Nazi\\'s sends this movie into fantasy-land.Ben Affleck is wrong as Jack Ryan -- he\\'s just too much of a sarcastic punk. You can\\'t buy him as the CIA analyst turned action hero. The rest of the cast is good, but most of the characters are complete idiots. Its hard to believe that the President of the US and the Premier of Russia wouldn\\'t talk to each other over the telephone during an international crisis, but in this movie they e-mail each other over AOL like a couple of adulterers.According to the trivia, Harrison Ford and Wolfgang Peterson (Director of Air Force One) turned down the opportunity to participate in this fiasco. They were smart to do so since there was nothing to gain but scorn for having any part in this horrible, horrible movie.\"', '\"Shows like Charlie\\'s Angels and the Love Boat should stay in the era of disco, bell-bottoms and rollerderby.  Its a shame that the new millenium has to start out by shamelessly borrowing from old TV shows.  I like a good parody when I see one (Naked Gun, Hot Shots!, etc.) but this film was so cheesy and predictable.  The part about Drew Barrymore missing a bullet was ridiculous.  Everything about the movie was awful.  See this at the risk of having your intelligence insulted. What\\'s next?  Dukes of Hazard the movie starring Tom Cruise and George Clooney and Cameron Diaz as Daisy??  Enough with the TV show parody, its not funny any more. One interesting note:  Check out the DVD Shrek and see Cameron Diaz\\'s \"interview\" as Princess Fiona.  She references Charlie\\'s Angels...soo funny! Rating: 5\"', '\"**WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS***Its not that this movie is bad -- it isn\\'t.  It\\'s just that the nature of certain events within too closely remember our nation\\'s most horrible day -- a day we must never forget, but never relive.Although the situation is clearly different from that of the actual events of September 2001, the destruction of part of the city of Baltimore and the significant loss of American lives as a result to me served only as a reminder of the tragedies in NY and DC.  It\\'s quite a shame that because of those events, I cannot recommend this film -- and firmly believe that it has no place being released.  Perhaps the memory of those events are just too close -- not enough time has passed.A well acted movie, and certain a solid thriller.  This film is original in many aspects and would have been a fresh and intriguing film if not for the coincidental similarities to 9/11.Without 9/11, I\\'d give this film an 8/10.  With 9/11, 4 of 10.\"', '\"On one level, \"The Fast and the Furious\" is two hours of machismo. But on another level, it does show the subculture of street racing. Before it came out, I\\'d never known that people soup their cars up with nitrous oxide to increase speed. Vin Diesel plays his typical role, and Paul Walker almost seems like a side character.I should identify that much of the movie looks pretty improbable. I won\\'t divulge the scenes right here for risk of spoiling the movie, but trust me: you\\'ll know these scenes when you see them. But like I said, the movie does give one an insight into the world of street racing. I never saw the sequel; I heard that it was the average kind of sequel (and summer 2003 saw a slew of lousy sequels).\"', '\"This is a bad movie...As someone who has enjoyed motorsports for several years, both as participating and watching, I found this movie to be offensive. The plot of the movie was good, and I liked the general concept of a movie about street racing, BUT, there is a fine line between good fiction and just plain crap.\"', '\"If you devote every dime you get into a little ugly car that runs fast has loud speakers so you can play annoying rap music and show it off to your other idiot friends...yea you know if you are one of those types...dork...An undercover cop poses as a street racer so he can find out who is responsible for the hijacking of trucks and the valuable equipment inside. The cop, Brian gets in so deep and close to the group of guys that he doesn\\'t want to bust them when he finds out the truth and yadda yadda.I like car movies and good chases, but this was a bit too cheesy for me. With all the clichÃ©s, the bad dated rap music, the little ugly cars that aren\\'t at all cool. As I said the people who are into that junk eat these movies up, but I think they are so cheesy, all the \"bros\" and slang these people use is annoying as hell...I wanted them all to die - crash and burn you fools.It has a lot of races, and some action, but still tame by real action standards..Rob Cohen makes a lot of those big budget wanna be action movies, some are okay, but I think his big star casting choices hurt his films. They sell at the box office, but we real movie fans hate these big hyped actors that are \"Hollywood\\'s finest\" - yea Hollywood\\'s most overrated..Paul Walker is a horrible actor, he does good in movies about surfers, but I could never take him serious as a cop or a bad a**. Although he was good in Running Scared...Vin Diesel is just one of those actors that sucks but hes big and muscular and gained a big fan base and he keeps getting these roles because of his size. He was great in Pitch Black, but after that I wish he had quit. The guy playing Vince, Matt Schulz is another very horrible actor. Poor Ja Rule, I like Ja Rule, not his music or his acting but I think he seems like a cool guy, but he shows here he cannot act.I will say I am a fan of Michelle Rodriquez and think although she plays the same character in everything shes ever done, I still like her. Ted Levine is one of my favorite actors so nice to see him here.This film isn\\'t horrible, but it isn\\'t a great action film. It has a lot of big stars, big production and big hype but it\\'s not got the story and action to back it up... I give it 3 out of 10 stars because it had its moments.\"', '\"I thouroughly enjoyed this film. It had action in spades, a reasonable story and lots of fast cars. The actors aren\\'t well known but that doesn\\'t make it bad. The race scenes are very well done and the bit with the Honda Civics and the truck are class. Suspend belief. Forget thinking and enjoy it for what it is, not what it should be. 7/10\"', '\"I waited so long for Mission Impossible 2 and when it arrived i convinced myself that it would be a very cool film. The rumors on the internet telling me that the movie had no real story or plot didn\\'t frighten me. Hay, it is Mission Impossible, Tom Cruise doesn\\'t want to ruin his childhood series, he will make sure that John Woo will compensate the story with a lot of action. But \\'o my god\\' what did they do? Anthony Hopkins in MI2 for 4 minutes, changing masks all the time (about 30 times), multiple loose ends, John Woo\\'s doves flying all over the place but now John Woo sees it as art and leaves the film for what it is. Nice shots from dancers and horse riders are stretched for minutes, what a bore... What happened to the original series style? There was no humor in the movie; when Ving Rhames asked Tom how the situation was on the island Tom said \\'Risky\\'. Why didn\\'t he say \\'Risky business\\'? That would be a nice inside joke! But hey, another perfectly genre waisted. Please don\\'t give us a Mission Impossible 3 i will watch some reruns of the series and play part 1 from time to time. Greetings Jeroen\"', '\"This can be best described as the weakest instalment of the franchise, no question. Same director, same actors, same aesthetic appeal. But something went wrong. Was it the ridiculously short 88 minute runtime? The underlying sense of familiarity? Over-reliance of noticeable computer generated effects? Unsurprisingly, it\\'s actually all of the above. However what really hit the nail in this chapter\\'s coffin was the identical plot. Agent Jay must restore Kay\\'s memory in order to stop an antagonistic alien from retrieving an object that can decimate planets. Just to confirm, I am describing the plot to the sequel, not the original. Ironically, they are exactly the same. Therefore automatically your mind starts to wander off thinking about how refreshing the first film was and how much of a \"cash grab\" this follow-up is. It doesn\\'t further an existing plot, nor does it develop any of the memorable characters. It just exists as if it took the phrase \"if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\" and forcefully applied it to every nook and cranny. The aliens, the love interest, the underwhelming conclusion. A villainous alien so functionally generic that the lingerie model it replicated would\\'ve had more personality. The uninspired lack of imagination, especially for a franchise that relishes in its own creativity, acts as a fitting juxtaposition for this instalment. Despite these criticisms, Smith and Jones give decent performances that feel consistent with the personalities defined in the original. The prosthetics and makeup, minimally used as they were due to substitution of mediocre visual effects, were well designed. The script contained a few amusing scenes amidst the lacklustre dialogue. Michael Jackson\\'s twenty second cameo was perfection. Honestly increased the rating by a point for his \"thrilling\" scene. Seriously though, there is no justification for this \"cash grab\" and after witnessing this, I for one would not join MIB. I wish I could neuralise myself...\"', '\"I already had doubts whether this would be a great sequel, but that it turned out to be so bloody bad, I couldn\\'t have known! This is not Mission Impossible, but some sort of cheap (it wasn\\'t cheap to make of course) James Bond rip-off. I really wondered why Tom Cruise finished this movie! It is totally dumb in comparison to his extremely well acted role in Magnolia. Personally, I think that John Woo is a good director when you look at the action sequences, and I know that he uses a lot of slow motion in these sequences. But, he used to much slow motion for me so that it became irritating and the action sequences looked too unrealistic! I liked John Woo\\'s Face/Off and Hard Target, but this was a total flop and even more worse than Broken Arrow! Barbarella is still my number one worst movie ever seen, but this one will certainly enter the top ten of this list! What was Anthony Hopkins doing in this movie by the way?! I will conclude this extremely negative review by saying that I\\'m glad I only saw it on VHS for 2 dollars (I\\'ve had a bad feeling about this! (see Star Wars)) and that a lot of people were fooled by going to the cinemas to see this stupid piece of junk (see Star Wars)!!!!!!!!!!!!P.s. The first Mission Impossible wasn\\'t nearly as bad as this, but certainly not perfect! Positive points about this film: the mountain climbing sequence!\"', '\"I must admit, I never would have rented this movie in a million years, but while visiting some friends who had rented it, I decided to give it a try. I really wasn\\'t expecting much, but planned to be open minded...and was pleasantly surprised.Agreeably, the movie did not challenge the brain or inspire deep thought, but it doesn\\'t pretend to.  The director intended the movie to be exciting, fast paced eye candy and that is exactly what it was.While I enjoyed the first movie (it was considerably more intelligent and required that you pay relatively close attention to the plot), I found it a little dry, and with the exception of the train sequence at the end and the scene where Ethan breaks into the CIA Terminal room, there was little in the way of excitement and energy.MI2 got off to an exciting start, and the action sequences (including Mr. Cruise\\'s impressive stunts) were choreographed to perfection by the talented John Woo - complete with all of his signature trademarks.Yes, we can talk about the plot holes, the incredulous,  impossible to believe story and the over-the-top, implausible action sequences, but did anyone really come to the theatre expecting realism from a summer blockbuster movie?All in all, the fabulous action, beautiful scenery, high-impact sound track and the mindless story proved to be 2 hours of guilty pleasure...and don\\'t we all need that once in a while?\"', '\"I saw the movie before reading any of the reviews.  When I got around to reading them, they were mostly negative.  John Woo has shown that he knows how to direct an action sequence, and his films are beautifully presented; the action scenes promise to show the audience something fresh and inventive (although some things can get tired by the end of the film) and they are shot with excellent clarity and a distinct style.  I\\'ve heard complaints about character development and the motorcycle sequence toward the end of the film.  If you want to see a movie with substance, go see Gladiator or watch American Beauty again.  If you want to see Bond with more style and less Denise Richardson, see M-I:2.  Action movies with character development are few and far between (I can only think of True Lies and Die Hard off hand).  Plot development in this film is mediocre at best.  But the action is what you paying for. M-I:2 isn\\'t as good as Face/Off, in my opinion John Woo\\'s best effort since his American debut, but far better that anything else since 1993.Alex Geiger\"', '\"When sitting in the theater for the first 30 minutes or so for this movie, I kept on wondering, is this movie going anywhere?? But however, it did eventually managed to pick itself up a bit and move more at a faster pace. The movie had humor in it, but I consider it the type of humor that a middle aged being would find funny. The realism in the movie was unbelievable! It actually appeared as if the audience was actually apart of or witnessing this abomb attack on the U.S. So I would have to say that it was a first rate Tom Clancy thriller!\"', '\"First off let me say I love action movies, and I really wanted to like this. Second Let me mention this movie did NOT fail because it is a sequel I believe, but it insults the audience.Mission Impossible 2 has great music, great sound, great actors and intriguing ideas yet shallow Story line.  But the complaints come from 2 parts.  The story line is shallow and then it is repeated. there is enough flashbacks in this MOVIE (which they seem to forget they are making) you might think you were at a Grateful Dead concert, and some of those flash backs intertwining two different dialogue.  It is hard to tell what is what. Is it so hard to remember the FIRST scene? why do they insult the audience that way, not all of us are morons.  Then they remind us of the MAJOR key scene in the final fight?  Why do they call us idiots like this?  It is sad.But that is not worst they could do.  There are some GREAT action moments, unfortunately they are ruined by the over use of one major special effect, SLOW MOTION!!! This movie\\'s action scenes each have a slow motion.  If the producers saw Matrix they could understand that slow motion might be good in moderation, but the way they use it in this movie, it is like over using crack?  anyone else notice that?  What are they hiding.... the fact the action only takes up about half the time it seems, maybe less.  They just want you to think it takes up more.Then there is the romantic story?  again? the producers are morons.  We don\\'t want to know romance. Action movie watchers want Sex, Violence, and Blood, And not too much romance but there is too much romance and talk about romance, and not that much skin.  I don\\'t care if someone wants to protect someone I want to see them do it, oops I just remembered, they screwed that up too.Don\\'t go to this for any reason unless you NEED Tom Cruise or you will die. Other then him the only redeemable quality is the fact it is a John Woo Flick. or maybe the use of Slow motion (you better love slow motion)Finally my recommendation? Get Matrix, and watch it again (always a good movie, and better done), or for theater fanatics go see Gladiator (great action flick and expertly done) or go to this awful movie and hope not to get p***ed off at John Woo\\'s big bomb.\"', '\"... it could have been a bit more believable.  In the first film, adrenaline and action was sacrificed upon the altar of (dubious and semi-comprehensible) plot and (Brian DePalma\\'s lackluster definition of) \"style\".  Unlike many others whose posts I\\'ve read, I didn\\'t care for M:I-1. It was slow and unstylish, despite the director\\'s desires... and whoever did the research for the Internet sequences fubar\\'d them with cheesy, low-tech AOL-looking images.M:I-2 had the style that the first film was missing.  Settings and technology in this film actually appeared to be slick-tech, and portions of THIS film where certain characters were breaking into high-security areas weren\\'t handled in as poor a fashion as the first.  (Poisoned coffee? Sensors which don\\'t register the sound of keyboard typing, which is certainly louder than a whisper?  And above all, being able to hack into CIA\\'s security systems?  Has no one heard of a firewall?)  Where M:I-2 lost my suspension of disbelief was the numerous car explosions (those not caused by plastique, anyways), proof that all film terrorists must be buying their automobiles from Yugo.  =)For the most part, M:I-2 was more coherent in style and comprehensibility, even if (or perhaps because?) it was possessed of a simpler and more linear plot than the first.  The action sequences were better conceived and filmed (it amazes me that people can be impressed by the poor-effects, yawnable \"hook the helicopter to the train\" schtick).  Overall, Woo is a far more capable director than DePalma seems to have become (with his last three directorial efforts, M:I-1, Snake Eyes, and Mission to Mars being particularly unentertaining).As for performances -- Tom Cruise turns in a decent performance, for an action movie.  =)  Dougray Scott is fairly solid as the villain.  Thandie Newton is, well, passable as a \"master thief\", although I wish she\\'d had more opportunity to show off her skills instead of simply being a face on screen.  That complaint also applies to most of the remaining support cast, but then, they ARE supporting cast.  M:I-2 is definitely a star vehicle for Tom Cruise, but in my opinion it\\'s a fairly fun one.My rating: 8/10.  But be sure to see it in a theater with good sound; it\\'ll lose something on video or in a venue where the speakers aren\\'t high-quality.\"', '\"\\'\\'Men in Black II\\'\\' is not fantastic as the first movie, but it is a good and entertaining movie to be watched anyway.It is so funny to see Michael Jackson as one of the aliens from MIB! (I mean, let\\'s be honest, the guy doesn\\'t even need a make up to look like one!)One of the things I need to complain about this movie, is the fact that we don\\'t have the same good explanations as the first one. A lot of errors are present, like the lack of story about Laura\\'s life explaining why she is the light of Zartha, if she is K\\'s daughter with Lauranna or not,as well as Johnny Knoxville\\'s character just disappearing without reason.It has been five years since Agent K returned to the comforts of a civilian life working as a mail man. Agent J, for the other hand, continues to work for the Men in Black, but he never has success finding a good partner to stay with him: all of them hated the life of being an agent and were neuralized. Serleena, an evil Kylothian alien, disguises herself as a Victoria Secrets\\' model while planning to find the Light of Zartha, that will put the galaxy in danger once again. Now J will need the help of agent K once again to save the planet, specially because he is the only one who knows where the Light of Zartha is.\"', '\"Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. Stars: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Rip Torn, Lara Flynn Boyle, Johnny Knoxville, Rosario Dawson, Tony Shalhoub and Patrick Warburton.This is a short and confusing, but quite entertaining sequel to the enormously popular Men in Black. The plot is confusing and kind of stupid, but it\\'s a well done film (except for some of the special effects). One of my main problems with this, is that it all seems like a big merchandising scam. They introduce cute characters and not so cute ones that are quite memorable, just so they can make dolls of it, however I did think Frank the pug was a good addition to the film after making only a cameo in the first film. It\\'s an entertaining film, but in no way is it good.** 1/2 out of ****. 82 mins. PG-13 for sexual humor.\"', '\"In as short as possible, I think this has been one of the best action movies to grace the screens in a few years. Vin Diesel does a superb job as does the rest of the cast. Also to their credit they tried to stick as realistic as possible with the stunts and equipment used. 2 thumbs up.\"', '\"Pierce Brosnan and all the cast have done commanding job for 40th anniversary of James Bond.  It does a good job of taking a new twist on hot spot in the world and putting together a spectacular, yet intelligent,  plot which is heavy on action and making a statement on today\\'s world.I was thankful that the writers chose to set the film in Korea, instead of Afghanistan or the Middle East, which would been a little trite and simplistic.  James Bond is the mythic figure of a man, who attacks a situation in his own uncompromising way.Here, we see him again doing the fantastic that one would expect only Bond to do. To some this spectacle may seem old, but to most there is sharp edginess to the film that remembers the best of Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and the original books.For Bond fans, there are so many references to the old films, that brings much of the best of the old to the present day.  For the new fan, Brosnan takes a fresh approach to the man, who we all love to watch and to overwhelmed by in his actions and his personality.Look for the cameo appearance of Madonna, who surprises me in how well she slips in and out of a single scene.  Her theme song is memorable, but still does not surpass the best theme songs done by Shirley Bassey, but it grows on you on each performance.Let us toast the new year with the best of Bond, the old, the new, and the amazing!\"', '\"The first half of the movie had some good bits but I swear the dog had all the good lines.  The second half will make you want to see the first half again.  Could have been great, but turned into way more computer generated special effects than I wanted to see. At times, I wondered if Smith and Jones were also computer generated.  5/10\"', '\"This movie is is different in everyone\\'s mind.  You may see this as \"an extreme action thriller or \"a corny peace of s**t\" there are reasons for both.  First of this movie contains many stunts performed by tom cruise.  the story is much easier to under stand than in the first movie. But some of the scenes are straight out of THE MATRIX. also the end of the film gets kind of weird when tom cruise is seen with a dove that flies around and just confuses people. also there is a large number of mask in this movie which makes in a little predictable. otherwise this is an all right movie and if you liked it you will be glad to hear that M:I-3 is up on the drawing board.\"', '\"I thought that \"The sum of all fears\" was going to be a movie hard to follow, like I felt with the Harrison Ford\\'s previous films, but it was not. It\\'s about politics all right; it reminded me a lot of Roger Donaldson\\'s \"Thirteen days\": USA and Russia at the brink of World War III. The difference is that \"Thirteen days\" is real history.This movie is about a rookie Jack Ryan who unexpectedly finds himself climbing steps in the CIA in the middle of a potential nuclear war between USA and Russia.Personally, I still don\\'t see why they cast Ben Affleck as the hero type of character. He didn\\'t make it in Pearl Harbor and the doesn\\'t make it in this one. He\\'s better off in supporting roles as in \"Good Will Hunting\".As I expected, Morgan Freeman steals every frame of the movie. His performances get better every time. Let\\'s hope the Academy reward him with an Oscar one of these years.\"The sum of all fears\" is a good and entertaining movie. It\\'s worth the while.\"', '\"I\\'m not a fan of westerns or kung-fu flics, so I\\'d never even noticed when Shanghai Noon originally came out in theaters.I saw a trailer for the sequel, Shanghai Knights, when waiting with my daughter to see Catch Me If You Can. I said, \"That looks different. Like it might be fun.\" She clued me into Shanghai Noon.So rent it we did, and it was a blast.Okay, so it\\'s a Jackie Chan vehicle flic. The plot is devised more to give him interesting things to do martial arts moves with than anything else. But the main characters are interesting and engaging, the humor is acutally funny (rather than just potty humor), and the martial-arts scenes are so beautifully choreographed, and so much fun, that even a kung-fu scrooge like me can thoroughly enjoy them.Interesting note -- as we were watching the train-robbery sequence, I muttered to my daughter, \"A kung-fu movie set in cowboy times.... Oh! Shang - High Noon. Groan.\"\"', '\"This movie is a good example of great fun. Isn\\'t that what movies should be for? Total entertainment. Not so good acting, good direction, good jokes, good special effects, nothing to think about. I specially liked the sci-fi geek scene. It reminded me of a lot of people that write in this forums! Obviously, if you want to think or be inspired by the message of a movie this movie is not for you. 7/10\"', '\"You understand in the start that this gangster comedy is no trash like \"Gone in sixty Seconds\".Not just only because of the famous actors mostly because of smart SoderberghÂ´s style that makes this feel fresh entertaining and funny.I would say that the main characters in this film are George Clooney and Brad Pitt and the acting is mostly good to.But itÂ´s not great because it has some problems.Julia Roberts has a so boring characters,I mean sheÂ´s good-looking but what more.It is not her fault she is a good actor but in this film the character for her was really boring and that was a disappointment.ItÂ´s a entertaining and funny film.The end is great and the best about it is the technical stuff.I would call this a film that is good  but nothing you see twice.3+/5\"', '\"It is beyond belief why Columbia/Sony greenlit this film with a 130 million dollar budget, nearly 7 times the budget as the first film. And if it weren\\'t for a few genuinely funny scenes, this bloated sequel nearly killed the franchise. Some would say it did kill the series until it was revived this year with Bad Boys For Life. This is what happens when you give Michael Bay a massive budget and creative freedom. No action film not directed by Christopher Nolan or produced by Marvel should have a running time of 2hrs and 32min and yet here we are. The action scenes drag on for far too long, as does the movie. Let\\'s just say we\\'re lucky that Sony execs were smart enough to not give Bay the opportunity to do the 3rd film from the directors chair.5.3/10\"', '\"I haven\\'t seen the precursor to this movie, but I get the feeling I don\\'t have to to know that this one is your average popcorn flick.Will Smith is a half-decent actor, and a lot better in comedy roles than anything else, so it almost worked having an action story with the occasional comedic relief. However, it\\'s mostly flash and bang. The special effects are satisfactory and the cinematography is respectable, but the plot is really shallow. I could have cared less about what was going on most of the time. This movie is not a thinker, that much is clear. It\\'s meant to entertain the part of your brain that likes explosions and watching people get shot for two hours. I\\'d put it on par with a movie like XXX.\"', '\"A rather unappreciated film really, but I thoroughly enjoyed it! A lot of great quirky comedic moments with some excellent physical humour. Depending on whether you enjoyed Frank the talking dog, the audience is overly exposed to the slightly dead pan humour of the dog, but redeems himself later on in the film. Its the minor characters in the film that really make the humour: the door man, Jeebs the funny looking black market dealer, the brief Michael Jackson moment, Zed. If you didn\\'t enjoy the first film, I wouldn\\'t recommend watching the second film, it isn\\'t outstandingly brilliant but certainly a good fun film that the family can also enjoy.\"', '\"On an objective scale, this film is pretty cheesy. It\\'s a direct ripoff of Point Break. The acting from Walker and a few others is pretty terrible. Every scene is unrealistic...But why do we watch movies? We watch because we enjoy them. And I can\\'t help but enjoy this film.It almost feels like it\\'s in the same world as Training Day. Not as dark (and certainly not nearly as good as Training Day). But it captures LA very well. And nostalgia runs through this film like crazy. Makes me sad to know those days are over. And even sadder to know that Walker is gone.\"', '\"The Tom Clancy movie mill had grown fairly stagnant recently, and, fortunately, The Sum of All Fears injects some new life into it.  It works very well as a political suspense flick, with enough action in it to make brain-dead movie fans like it.I was very pleased to see a post-9/11 movie about terrorists not deal with Islamic fundamentalists, but rather the more shifty neo-fascist right-wing groups all over the world.  The plot is mostly believable, and the tension developed between Russia and the U.S. sucks you in throughout.  The nuclear blast was a little disappointing, but given the fact that it was a low-yield weapon, I guess that\\'s to be expected.  I was pleased that none of the performances were over-the-top, as each actor seemed to fit into their role very well.  Ben Affleck avoids overacting, for the most part, and Liev Schreiber was just great as the CIA agent Clark. \\nOverall, a good movie worth watching, but only gets a 9 from me because I really can\\'t stand Tom Clancy anymore.\"', '\"So we have director barry sequel to the mega hit this one is good but is not great hence the 7 so tommy lee jones and will smith and pug is back fight scum aliens regulating all things alien on earth their latest mission to save the world from a intergalactic disaster when a rengegade Kylothian monster disguised as a lingerie model threatens the survival of our race jay must find kay reboot his memory from his job in the post office with headquarters under siege and time just gone the two agents enlist the help of frank and a posse of hard living aliens worms to help them avoid wipe out and so its just another day in the war and keeping their office intact its good but not great\"', '\"This is not as good as the 1st Men In Black, but still a very entertaining and underrated sequel, Tommy lee and Will Smith had wonderful chemistry together once again!. All the characters are great, and the story while very similar to the original is still pretty cool, plus Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are simply amazing in this!. The effects by Rick Baker are really cool, and I thought Will Smith carried the film just fine until he found Tommy again!, plus it also has plenty of laughs in it too, especially when Frank (The Dog), is singing out the window. The finale is very good, and I personally felt Rosario Dawson made a great addition to the cast!, plus I feel that critics and movie fans alike are way too harsh on this film in my opinion. It\\'s quite well made, and while it doesn\\'t come close to matching the original, it\\'s still pretty damn good for a sequel!, plus it paves way for another possible sequel. At 80 to 88 minutes, it\\'s a great breezy time waster, and the ending was really cool!, plus all the characters were very likable. This is not as good as the 1st Men In Black, but still a very entertaining and underrated sequel, Tommy Lee and Will Smith had wonderful chemistry once again, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Barry Sonnenfeld does a very good! job here with great camera work cool angles and just keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is excellent. Will Smith is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is hilarious, had wonderful chemistry with Tommy Lee once again, had some really funny lines, kicked that ass, and did the same things that made him so funny in the 1st! (Will Rules!!!). Tommy Lee Jones is also amazing as always, and is amazing here, while we don\\'t see him until after 30 minutes in to the movie, he hadn\\'t lost his touch, and played the straight man once again, and like Smith did the same thing that made him so good in the 1st!. (Tommy Lee Rules!!!). Rip Torn is great as Zed once again i really liked him, he was funny. Lara Flynn Boyle is decent here, and looked great, however i didn\\'t find her all that menacing. Johnny Knoxville is OK here, I am a huge fan of this guy, however, he just wasn\\'t all that funny, and didn\\'t have that much to do, and disappeared in the 3rd Act he still rocks though! (Knoxville Rules!!). Rosario Dawson is very pretty and did what she had to do extremely well i really liked her. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5\"', '\"Eventhoguh there were repots of on-set clashes between writer and director and between director and star, this reboot of the Shaft films is excellent and should have been a franchise. Director/co-writer John Singleton (\"Boyz n the Hood\" \"Snowfall\") and writer Richard Price (\"The Wire\" \"The Color of Money\") don\\'t go the remake route and instead tell a new story about NYC police detective Samuel L. Jackson, Det. John Shaft, who\\'s the nephew of Richard Roundtree, who plays retired detective Uncle John Shaft, which makes this more of a reboot or sequel of sorts, much like the new Star Trek series is kind of a remake, but also a continuation of the original series. Roundtree only makes a cameo, but it\\'s fun moment. The main story revolves around the excellent Christian Bale as a Donald Trump Jr. type of smarmy spoiled rich kid who uses his wealth to dodge a racially motivated beating/murder he perpetrated before fleeting the country. Shaft and Bale have a fun game of cat and mouse when Bale returns to the states, each trying to take the other down. Singleton\\'s intersecting of racism as a key plot point makes this film more than just a straightforward action film and also connects it to it\\'s blaxploitation roots, in which films like \"Black Caesar\" or \"Black Sampson\" were low budget genre pictures heavy on sex and violence, but always included a fair amount of social justice underpinning their storylines. Another major strength of this film is it\\'s amazing cast. Besides Jackson and Bale as two strong leads, you also have Jeffrey Wright memorably playing sleazy drug dealer Peoples Hernandez, Vanessa Williams, Busta Rhymes, Dan Hedaya, Toni Collette, Phillip Bosco, Pat Hingle, Lee Tergesen, Mekhi Phifer, Catherine Kellner, Elizabeth Banks, and besides Roundtree you also have the original film\\'s director Gordon Parks and the original film\\'s composer Isaac Hayes (\"Can you dig it?\") in bit parts. Another major asset of the film is it\\'s excellent use of New York City locations, recalling gritty action films of the 70s such as \"The French Connection\" or \"Across 100th Street,\" choosing to show the seedier side of the city that never sleeps rather than the cleaned-up touristy version. Overall, the 2000 Shaft is well worth watching and one that should be better recognized. FUN FACT!

Most of the lead actors were pretty weak, the story was meh but it was pretty entertaining. It is also a very quotable movie with \\'You can have any drink... as long as it\\'s a Corona\\' being a quote that has become surprisingly popular. The movies main focal point(its races) were also pretty weak which is stupid considering that was what this franchise was founded on. In conclusion, it\\'s enjoyable and I recommend it, but don\\'t expect much.The types of people who will like this movie will be people who enjoy car movies and movies including races.Would Recommend.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Paul Walker was fine as Brian O\\'Connor and the supporting cast was reasonable. Vin Disel was very weak as Dominic Toretto and he\\'s just not a very good actor. People say that he \\'keeps this franchise together\\' but I argue it would be better without him. It\\'s been proved he can\\'t act and that\\'s never been so obvious that these movies. I liked the ending. The premise and overall story, however, were very stupid and didn\\'t work.I liked the cinematography for the most part but I feel like the actual RACE sequences were very poorly done and looked incredibly stupid.The effect were pretty poor. The actual set and costume design was nice.This movie was entertaining from start to finish and that is what it set out to do so I will assume it succeeded in that respect. It also introduces all the characters well and gives them reasonable roles in the story. I will say that the dialogue in this movie is actually not terrible and \\'You can have any drink... as long as its a Corona\\' is just a fun quotation. I will also say that the music didn\\'t fit for the most part and felt out of place.Personally, I enjoyed the movie all the way through but its not something I can see myself going back to constantly because I just don\\'t see much point to it. It has its moments and some scenes were cool but it just doesn\\'t provide enough to kick off a franchise nor does it deserve to be this popular among fans.6/10\"', '\"Alright All I have to say is that the film was a Farce of the first film that De Palma constructed so beautifully.  It the kind of movie where people of the world would be offended that Cruise and Wagner would even accept a script of that pathetic caliber.  I\\'ve seen monkeys write better than that, seriously.  Any ways when I walked away I was truly offended and I almost yelled, \"I\\'m mad as Hell, and I\\'m not going to take it anymore!!\"Or something like that.\"', '\"After a splendidly confusing setup involving a Russian scientist, some kind of diabolical science experiment, M:I-2 tracks down its hero Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise), in mid-vacation, hanging by his fingertips on the edge of a dazzling rock formation somewhere in Utah.

No-one\\'s asking anyone to expect more.The stunts are mind-boggling, the soundtrack\\'s surely inspirational, Tom Cruise has given us a top performance. John Woo\\'s certainly made a superb entertainer. It equals if not beats Face-Off(John Woo sticks to the face-masks in this one too). If there\\'s anyone who\\'s not going for it because \"the expected never happens\", don\\'t ever miss it!\"', '\"Personally, I don\\'t know how anybody can\\'t like Die Another Day. I thought it was a great Bond movie!! All the haters out there are probably people who have read the novels and now they are loyal to the books. To me, it doesn\\'t matter if a movie is like the novel or not. All I care about is if the movie is entertaining, has good acting, has familiar actors, and good special effects. Other than that, it doesn\\'t matter to me in the slightest. I think it would be miserable to be faithful to a book or novel because, when you\\'re expecting something this way, and you get it another way, then literally the whole movie is ruined for you. Which would suck in my opinion.Die Another Day is a great Bond flick. It is entertaining, has a great actor for Bond, a very evil villain, and a really pretty Bond girl. Speaking of actors, all the acting in this film was superb. Pierce Brosnan gave us an excellent performance as super-spy James Bond. Toby Stephens gave us a truly haunting performance as the super-villain Gustav Graves. Last but certainly not least, Halle Berry gave us a truly memorable performance as Jinx. Like I said before, the acting in this film is superb. A job well done by Pierce, Toby, and Halle.The one thing that truly made this Bond film enjoyable was the big car chase near the end of the film. It was an amazing thing to watch. I never knew cars slipping and sliding on ice was so fun to watch!! When I was watching this movie I thought, the stunt drivers must have had the time of their lives making that movie!! I know if I was one of the stunt drivers, I would be having the time of my life!! This film was a rush from beginning to end. It was extremely entertaining and I enjoyed every single minute of it!! So please don\\'t listen to the haters out there. You will enjoy this film no matter what. I am sure of it.\"', '\"I don\\'t think this movie is worth much at all.  Too many stupid scenes, too much bad acting, too much to appeal to a 15 year old and no one else.  None of it was clever, interesting, realistic or worthwhile. \\nThe actors all have exactly one expression - anger - and they never stray far from that.  I think they all took the second half of the title too seriously.  Why are they furious anyway?  What do they have to be furious about? Paul Walker literally sleepwalks through the entire movie and if Vin Diesel is the new action hero for the new generation, I want a recount.  I liked Jordana Brewster a lot in \"The Faculty\" and was looking forward to seeing her in this, but she\\'s wasted.  Michelle Rodriguez is cementing her future as a tough girl doing movies like this - wasn\\'t she in that female boxing movie too?The only positive thing I can say is that the movie seems to have some respect for its audience.  By being rated PG-13, at least the people who would most benefit (!) from seeing this garbage would be allowed in.\\nRacing scenes are no great achievement, either. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Makes \"Driven\" seem like its not the most recent disaster on wheels - at least you could laugh at that one. 1/10.\"', '\"I wasn\\'t expecting a great film when I went to see M:I 2, but I was expecting something as good as the first. Unfortunately what I got was one of the worst films of the summer season. I am a huge fan of John Woo, but I have to admit that maybe even he needs to stop and think about what he s doing to a film before he releases it. The first film was well-paced and had plot twists which were surprising. M:I 2 is slow and doesn\\'t once leave the audience guessing what is happening. Whoever said that M:I 2 is action packed must be comparing it to \"Beaches.\" The action takes forever to develop and when it does it\\'s over before you realize it. Another annoying factor in this movie is Woo\\'s apparent love of slow-motion. Every scene seems to have a point of slow-mo even if it is absolutely unnecessary. Avoid this movie if you can, do not waste your money!!\"', '\"I would call this a decent action movie, standing on its own.  However, it is based upon a book.  The concept of the two are the same, but the movie departs from the book in many details.  The other three movies stay relatively true to the books, and they are generally consistent with one another.  I can find no way to make this movie consistent with any of the books or with the other movies.  I\\'m curious how Tom Clancy as executive producer felt about this movie.  He should know better than anyone else that this movie is inconsistent with everything that came before it.I enjoyed the movie, but I was constantly bothered by the dissimilarities. I had heard a few things about it, and I had seen trailers for it, so I was actually shocked at the start when it appeared to hold true to the book. It quickly strayed.  Jack Ryan\\'s personal and professional lives are on a VERY different level than in the book.  Jack was powerful (in all books but Patriot Games) and married with children (in all the books).  By the time The Sum of All Fears was written, Jack had acquired high status.  To turn him into a pee-on again and to make him single is like creating a new character.  He becomes much more like Clark/Kelly.  Perhaps it\\'s time to do one of the Clark books...Much of the activity surrounding the bomb itself was off by a bit.  The source for the plutonium was the same, but it was used by two different groups, for different purposes, exploded in different locations, and the explosion was weak for two different reasons.I\\'m not trying to say that the movie was bad.  I gave it a six.  It would have been higher, however, if it hadn\\'t been riding Tom Clancy\\'s coattails and not doing such a good job of that.\"', '\"I must admit that I went into \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" not expecting to enjoy it. To my surprise, it turned out to be an entertaining movie, if you don\\'t take it too seriously. Based on the 1970s TV series of the same name, this remake is updated to the present and is essentially a comic book come to life. The plot is incidental to the babes, the action and the seemingly impossible array of stunts. It is surely a showcase for the physical attributes of its three female stars.All are given ample opportunity to display their fabulous figures and to wear various fancy super-hero costumes. Some of the situations are taken right from the old Saturday afternoon serials. For example, the three heroines get blown up at least twice, fall off buildings, one even dodges a bullet and all emerge without so much as a scratch or a hair out of place. Starring as the \"angels\" are Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and the delectable Lucy Liu. All have the bodies and mischievous twinkles in their eyes to carry all of this nonsense off. Bill Murray as Bosley almost steals the picture. It was good to see him back in form. The only holdover from the TV series is John Forsythe who again provides the voice for the never seen Charlie. Others in the cast include Sam Rockwell and Kelly Lynch as the good guys/bad guys, Tim Curry wasted in a small role and Crispin Glover as a sort of robotic henchman. LL Cool J and Tom Green put in cameo appearances along the way. \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" is a fun movie.\"', '\"While I am all for a good popcorn movie this movie forces you to suspend all common sense and reality to believe that what the actors are doing is plausible. Biggest complaint? These are all trained sys/mercenaries. how can someone believe that a person can simply put on a mask and expect every one to not notice its a mask? i mean really! these things take hours to apply (We hear all the time about the hours actors take to get into character suits and masks.) and we are expected to believe Ethan Hunt can walk around the corner slip on a mask and then walk back into the room and everyone believes he is someone else? it makes my head hurt thinking about it.\"', '\"Sheesh, what an embarrassment of a movie... I thought nothing could surpass the worst movie of the year (Star Wars Ep II), but some how a major upset has taken place..

Not a great movie, but a real good movie. I watched this after reading all the negative comments stating that it\\'s no where as good as the book. But commonÂ… give me a breakÂ… name one movie other than LOTR which is as good as the book. The book handles the story in a different way. So what? The matter at hands is quite sensitive. Books do not reach many people but movie will. And so the director was real careful in designing the characters.The story line is real powerful. Although there are many loop-holes, the movie keeps you guessing till the end.Ben Affleck is no Jack Ryan. He is boringly cute and does not demand the respect or attention as that of Harrison Ford. May be Matt Damon would have been a better choice for the role. Morgan freeman was wasted. Bridget is hot. Ciaran Hinds is a perfect fit for the role. His presence is ominous. The dialogues are quite well written. The phrase when the Nazi guy describes Hitler is quite fascinating and amazing true.I like the ending discussion between Jack Ryan and KGB guy is fascinating and hope there will be more.Leave the negative comments. If you see the movie first, before reading the book, you will enjoy it. (6/10)\"', '\"I cannot believe how bad this movie is. Yes, the effects ARE well made and so are the action sequences. But, frankly, the movie fails profoundly in terms of compelling storyline and real suspense. John Woo has once again delivered a myriad of action but also a movie which\\'s desperately looking for a plot.\"', '\"I can tell by his performances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown that Jackson is a good actor. And although he tries his best he is unable to give Shaft a good story.He stars as the lead detective and with his quick wit, sharp dialogue and racist jokes he captures the spirit of the infamous black icon perfectly.The problem throughout is Jackson\\'s supporting actors and mostly the story.I have no idea why Busta Rhymes was chosen because he simply cannot act and Jeffery Wright is unable to pull off a decent performance which downgraded me liking for him which was a shame because I thought he starred well in Ali.The story is the main problem. Even though it is brilliant in capturing the crime genre perfectly the story never gets itself off the ground, is slow, inconsistent, predictable, unfunny when it tries to be but more than not it is sheer Boredom.The beginning engaged me and had me interested right from the off but after the murder scene was finished it became increasingly dull.It has no interest to it, the stories contained have probably all been done before and therefore lacks something interesting for the audience.Captures the crime genre well and Jackson does his best but it is a disappointment and not really worth watching. If you like crime and racist jokes then I recommend it but its not the best one around, watch Bad Boys or Pulp Fiction 6/10\"', '\"The first movie that I can ever recall seeing twice in a week at the theater!

Wonderful time.\"', '\"ok, BB2 is a perfectly explosive, funny cop buddy movie. it\\'s got pretty much what the first one had, although Gabrielle Union definitely deserves more screen time. The main problem is 2 1/2 hours of the same virtually non-stop action is just way over the top. a brainless action movie should not be putting you to sleep, and this one can, just becuase of the endless repetition. huge car chases are one thing, but how long can you watch the same thing again and again and again? they could have easily chopped 30-40 min off of this movie. it reminded me of FaceOff, where you think the movie is finally over, but then... a whole other action scenario. geez, was that really necessary? i wanna go home already!!! BB1 was 32 min shorter and 32 min better. the end.\"', '\"Mission Impossible II is an action movie for lovers of John Woo.  It has all the elements of a Woo film:  mirrored protagonist-antagonist, girl caught in the middle, even doves during action.  It also has an abundance of Woo-style action.  His famous slow-mos and superlative gunfire is all here.  It\\'s a great ride for those who are looking strictly for action.  On the other hand, it has almost nothing to do with it\\'s title.  The only Mission Impossible tradition which has been maintained is the disguises the hero (and villain) wears.  There is no ingenious sting, no avoidance and subterfuge - just in-your-face confrontation.I\\'m not saying it was a bad film.  For action fans, it\\'s probably the best Woo film yet.  Just don\\'t go expecting it to bear any kind of connection to the TV show or even to the first Cruise MI.\"', '\"One of the reasons I go to the movies is to be entertained & get away from reality - the Fast & the Furious truly sucked me into another world that I wouldn\\'t even have thought existed and I enjoyed the movie for what it was...fast cars, action packed scenes, more fast cars, Paul Walker\\'s good looks & Van Diesel\\'s hot pumpin\\' biceps! Bring it on, I say! This is one of the best adrenalin rush I ever got sitting down!\"', '\"When I first saw this film 5 years ago at the cinema I was a little disappointed. I enjoyed the film a lot but I was a big fan of Mission Impossible 1 and had seen the TV series on occasion. The first movie was a great spy film, with all its clever twists and turns and Ethan Hunt a sympathetic human character, here he is recast as action man or to put it another way the American version of James Bond, which would have been fine if not for Tom Cruise essentially being a completely different character than he was in MI1. But thats where the negative points end. This movie is, on the surface a big cheesy action film, the kind of thing Dolph Lundgren or Steven Segal would be in, only its good. There is a good plot despite many comments although you do get the sense that the plot was put in afterwards to facilitate the action. Essentially its about villains peddling a super virus and its cure so they can make money from making people ill and then selling the cure. Its really not that important, this movie shines in the action scenes and has some excellent cheesy dialogue \"This isn\\'t mission difficult Mr.Hunt, this is mission impossible\" Overall this is the movie equivalent of eating an entire box of quality street to yourself in one sitting- you love it but feel a bit guilty afterwards.If you have the DVD be sure to watch \"Mission Improbable\" an excellent behind the scenes parody from MTV with Ben Stiller.\"', '\"I give this movie an 8 because throughout the film I was cruising for some R-rated action, more than even Tom Cruise was able to deliver.  Don\\'t get me wrong, this film was action packed; however, I feel the movie was directed this time at mainstream and young audiences thus the PG-13 rating.  Director John Woo is know for his all out violent and action packed films like The Killer, Bullet in the Head and Hard Boiled.  Here the action is thick and heavy with sweat rather then ketchup (blood).  The ending was less then desirable.  What saved this movie for me was Great Special Effects, Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames and the Aussie and a nice musical score.  My favorite scene would have to involve the pigeon sequence so don\\'t get any popcorn during this part!\"', '\"Mainly the movie is a stylish mess, reflecting a casual disregard for plot logic. It might have been fun, however, had it not been so blatantly racist -- indeed, race-baiting. Most disturbing of all is the trumped-up ending which defines the underlying anti-social message of the film. A similar story by a white director with the racial roles reversed would never have received distribution, and rightly so. Shaft is sloppy work,which is bad enough; but it also sends an irresponsible message.\"', '\"If you like Rush Hour, then you got to watch this ! It is packed with laugh and action, nonstop for 120 minutes ! Don\\'t watch this if you are looking for hardcore fighting movie. This will definitely lighten your day.\"', '\"\"Mission: Impossible 2\" is a very exciting action flick, but there is nothing at the core of it.  The action sequences are totally stilted, and a lot of the stunts seem to copy off of 1999\\'s superior action film, \"The Matrix.\"  Tom Cruise gives yet another self-aware, but interesting, performance.  Dougray Scott does his best with his cardboard villain, but comes off just as flat and colorless as his character.  Thandie Newton isn\\'t given much to do with her character, except sleep with Cruise\\'s character and some other stuff, too.  The highlight performance is the cameo by Anthony Hopkins, who, unfortunately, only turns up a few times in the film. Overall, certainly not a terrible film, but basically a waste of time.  I give \"Mission: Impossible 2\" 5.5 out of 10.\"', '\"I liked The Fast and the furious. It\\'s not my type of movie, but I like it. I am not into the cars and stuff like that, though I probably should be. The Fast and the furious films aren\\'t exactly my favorite, because I have given a thumbs down to three out of four of the films. I didn\\'t like the second and third film. The fourth film wasn\\'t great but the first film was the only one that I gave a thumbs up to. The original film was the best for many reasons. But mostly because the original, wait for it, was the most original. To rap up my review I will say a few more things. I had a good time with The Fast and the furious and I give it a thumbs up. Wow, that really was a short review. I told you.The Fast and the furious:***/****\"', '\"I went into this movie not expecting much but I was wonderfully surprised. The acting was great especially George Clooney and Brad Pitt. I was surprised at how many great actors were cast and they were all perfect for their parts. This movie kept my attention the entire time and I didn\\'t look at my watch once. The plot was interesting but what was really great was the comedy. I would recommend this movie to anyone, as I have been ever since I saw it. Vanilla Sky does not even compare.\"', '\"Well, obviously, MIB II wasn\\'t as good as the original \"Men In Black\", but it was quite enjoyable.  It\\'s a typical sci-fi/action film with occasional intelligence.I wouldn\\'t say this is a great movie, but if you want fun, then you\\'ve come to the right place.The plot deals with alien Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) attempting to retrieve some jewel that I don\\'t remember what it was called, so she can take over the universe or something.  Agent J (Will Smith) is called upon by Zed (Rip Torn) to deneuralize Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), his partner from the original and the \"most feared human in the Universe.\"This film is a good example of how to use special effects.  When the effx are in the background, or just monsters (the worms, Jeffrey the Giant Worm), they are quite effective (though I will admit the worms look kind of cheesy).  Not when they\\'re everything (backgrounds, characters, et al), like in \"Star Wars: Episode II\".Frank the Pug-Dog is funny as well, though he is a bit overused.  A swearing dog barking to \"Who Let The Dogs Out?\" and singing \"I Will Survive\" is kinda funny, no matter how you slice it.  Smith\\'s humor (which was very good in the original [ex.: to an alien/criminal: \"You just p*ssin\\' everyone off today!\", and his explanation of why he shot a little girl rather than the aliens in the MIB shooting gallery]) is a bit underused conversly, though he\\'s okay (esp. when spitrapping with the alien postal worker). Jones is stern and occasionally funny, Boyle is sexy and evil, and the rest of the cast is okay (though I wasn\\'t particularly fond of that guy with two heads).All in all, pretty good for an action/sci-fi film.  No \"Spiderman\", but way better than \"Episode II\".7/10\"', '\"The film begins with the death of a moderate Russian president and his replacement by a radical named Nemerov. To know who they are dealing with, the American Government recruits an academic who has just written an article about it. However, there seems to be a drop in the loyalty of Russian officials and there are personnel willing to provoke a nuclear war between both countries.The film is a regular thriller based on yet another imminent threat of war between the major world powers. The first part of the film prepares the events, while the rest is the unfolding and worsening of the military crisis, already in a climate of war. For me, the plot worked reasonably, taking some questions of logic and plausibility that seem to me very relevant (such as the fact that the military did not go in search of the nuclear bomb that the plane was carrying when it crashed, or the quiet walks that certain characters give the scenario where, hours before, a devastating nuclear bomb exploded).The cast is satisfactory to the level of this film: Morgan Freeman is competent, to see Richard Marner again was a pleasant surprise and James Cromwell did his part well. Ben Affleck, in turn, sounds a lot to himself and to dozens of other characters. There are few differences between this character and the one he offered us in \"Armageddon\".From the technical point of view, I emphasize the excellent cinematography and the good use of colors, but also the effects of contrast and dark light. There may have been, in part of the film, a change of lens for more diffused luminance when necessary. The special effects and sound effects are also very good, except for the scene where the bomb explodes, because it never seemed realistic enough to be believable.Overall, it\\'s a medium movie, which is not terribly good or truly inedible. Nice to see, it\\'s not the kind of movie that makes us think.\"', '\"...as the credits rolled.Why, you ask? Because ever since I saw the original kings of cool, The Rat Pack, I\\'ve been hooked by their style. Their songs, their clothes, their attitude and their movies defined coolness. So when I heard that my favorite Rat Pack Movie, Ocean\\'s 11, was being remade I had one thought in my mind? Will they mess it up?Its a proven fact that remakes end up being crappy, as seen with Psycho, Planet Of The Apes, and A Kid In King Arthur\\'s Court/Black Knight. My fears were put to rest when Steven Soderbergh was given the helm, as he directed great films like Out Of Sight and The Limey (but stumbled with his last two Erin Brockavich and Traffic). Then he assembled a great cast with Clooney, Damon, Pitt, Mac, Gould, Casey Affleck, Garcia, Cann and Cheadle. I was weary with the addition of Julia Roberts (since she has been known to mess with a movie\\'s chemistry), but she was able to pull off her role.\\nEveryone did their part from music from David Holmes, to cameos from TV teen stars. Great pacing, great storytelling, a heist movie that doesn\\'t seem far-fetched. No singing though....\\nAs a fan of the original and a fan of movies, this is one not to be missed. They hit the bullseye, they did it flawlessly\"', '\"Every bad thing you\\'ve heard about this movie is true so I wont waste your time repeating the same things. I also felt this movie was one big advertisement..did you know Martha Stewart is even listed in the end credits because for some unknown reason, she is seen twice on a television. And what was the purpose for Micheal Jacksons cameo? No one in the audience laughed, so if it was meant to be funny it didn\\'t work. I think if they make a Men in Black III it should go straight to video. 5/10\"', '\"Unbelievably BAD, that is.Years ago, aome friends and I sat down as a joke to design the worst possible Bond movie... all the most worn out, tired cliches, the worst one-liners, etc.This movie WAS that movie.  (Spoilers ahead)*Whack* - how\\'s that for a punch line?*Care to wager?* - no, I don\\'t go in for cock fights.The TRUE power of Icarus... Mr. Bond was right beside me and didn\\'t figure out who I am... Bond, James Bond... and don\\'t even TALK to me about that horrific and pathetic \"theme song\".This movie is NOT without it\\'s pluses. As an example for how NOT to make a Bond film, this movie shines. As an example of how NOT to use special effects, this movie stands out. Oh my GOD... an invisible CAR?! That\\'s just embarassing. The ever-annoying zip-around-fast-forward scene change? AGH!Next time, why not have someone involved who actually knows what a Bond movie is supposed to be? Hey, didn\\'t I see the bald bad-guy as the antagonist in Fast and Furious? Watch this movie at your peril.\"', '\"Firstly, this movie became a masterpiece and a blockbuster of all times - not because of it\\'s plot, literally it is plain, but because of the scenes with the fast, tuned, hot cars, having neon lights and nitrous which was something people had never seen before. There had been many racing movies but this one is unique itself because of the illegal racing stuff. In my opinion this movie is very underrated because of it\\'s low ratings and disliking reviews complaining about plot, but - come on, guys this ain\\'t a movie whose purpose is to having a nice plot. If you want a nice plot movie go watch Star Wars but the purpose of the F&F franchise is to see some fast beautiful cars, hot chicks and affairs which are not about love but something more... I admit that the writing was not well-made but the defense of this disadvantage is that action films don\\'t need perfect writing - go watch a good drama instead if you want a good writing.What I mean is that this movie is the origin of the illegal street racing movies and was the first of it\\'s kind. Then we saw Street Racer, Born to Race and even the failure of the year - 200 MPH. But all those movies were inspired by the Fast and the Furious franchise. The plot is plain and predictable otherwise it is different than any plot in any other action movie made before the movie. The acting was great - all the actors made the deal especially Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, whose roles made them famous and the reason being famous now is only the movie. The special effects, that every action movie need to have, are immaculate and the stuff used in the movie is perfect. In addition, people in real life became inspired about tuning their own cars and this movie is the reason about that. In my opinion if you\\'re a fan of cars you should definitely watch the movie and will truly love it. If you expect too much or are a drama/comedy person you will also not be disappointed but also not so satisfied. \"Damn\" I can say so many things about this movie that literally mean a defence of itself but I would repeat myself so I will skip to the summary.... The movie is a blockbuster itself. It is plot is plain and predictable but because it\\'s unique itself and is origin of all illegal street racing movies so this makes the meaning of the plot inconsequential. The acting is awesome as immaculate are the special effects too. The writing is typical for an action movie, despite being awful but what really makes this hustle and bustle movie amazing is it\\'s uniqueness and beautiful adrenaline among fast and tuned cars. Recommendation - just watch if you\\'re big fan of cars and adrenaline. Don\\'t expect much if you\\'re not.Plot - mild, plain, predictable though it is unique and doesn\\'t need to be amazing. 6/10.Acting - Amazing; Vin, Jordana, Michelle and Paul do very nice job. 10/10Writing - as plain as the plot is though it\\'s very typical to the classic action movies. 6/10Performance - Immaculate special effects; Very beautiful designed cars; Spectacular racing scenes. 10/10OVERALL: 8/10, though I give it an excellent personal TEN because it is literally my favourite franchise.\"', '\"Oh dear, what a dilemma.  Having slagged off films with no substance and lame plots in the past, Charlie\\'s Angels should get the same treatment but I loved it. Which proves it\\'s not what you do but the way that you do it.\\nLet\\'s face it Charlies Angels was the Baywatch of the day.  And it would therefore be a mistake to expect the film version to have undergone the same transformation as the Mission Impossible series made to the big screen.It\\'s certainly courageous for the film-makers to create something which is unashamed, unadulterated funny fun.  There is a tendency to design huge memorable action set-pieces and to write a plot around them as convincingly as possible - like Mission Impossible 2. Charlie\\'s Angels manages it quite well although the racing cars sequence is slightly blatant irrelevant nonsense.  That was the second time the bad guy ran away for no reason just to have a chase scene.  People note that there were 14 writers who had their hand on the screenplay at some point.  Due to scheduling conflicts they had to start the film before the script was finished.  The last act was meant to be a last minute job but that works fine it\\'s the middle section which doesn\\'t quite hold water.  Although it has its faults I wasn\\'t bored and I wasn\\'t annoyed too much. The tongue is clearly firmly in cheek and quite frankly the storyline with the typical British bad guy made me forgive everything.\"', '\"Brosnan and the Bond team have it made. The 1990\\'s films alone have raked in 1.2 billion $ US. I\\'ve been a devout Bond fanatic for years, and I\\'m pleased to say Die Another Day is right up there as one of the best Bond entries in the last twenty years. Brosnan has appeared as Bond in 1995\\'s GoldenEye, 1997\\'s Tomorrow Never Dies, and most recently, 1999\\'s The World Is Not Enough. Die Another Day blasts the Bond formula into the 21st century. Despite some God awful CGI in some sections, particulary in reference to Bond\\'s escape from Icarus in the Jet Dragster, its a racy, exciting and energetic story, masterfully created by all involved. Casting here was inspired. Piece now looks the right age for Bond, he combines the stark violence of Dalton, the wit of Moore, and the powerful presence of Connery and Lazenby. Halle Berry gives a very rounded and enjoyable turn as tough NSA agent Jinx Jordan. Special mentions must go to Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Rick Yune and Will Yun Lee as the villains, an expertly talented group who really give Bond a run for his money. The production, is as ever on Bond, immense and spectacular, and with $142 million to play around with, they kept up the Cubby Broccoli tradition of making every penny apparent on screen. Peter Lamont is well deserving of a second Oscar for his beautiful production design. David Arnold brings the Bond sound into the 21st century, with a techno/orchestra driven score that punches up the action a treat, and the first use of a choir in the score since 1979\\'s Moonraker is truly inspired. I have to admit I came out of seeing Die Another Day the first time incredibly shocked, unsure of what I thought. I\\'d loved The World Is Not Enough, particulary as many of it\\'s elements harkened back to the 1960\\'s Bond\\'s, look at the similarities between Elektra King\\'s ski suit, and the one worn by Diana Rigg in 1969\\'s On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service. I saw Die Another Day again and it firmly established itself to me as a corking film with brilliant performances, action and locales. It has been very much worth the two and a half year wait! 10 / 10 without a doubt!  Roll on Bond 21!\"', '\"I saw this movie on DVD and thank god not in cinema. i am shocked about the change of James Bond, he no longer is the cool, smart and real spy who saves the world, now he is a hero with a big gun and yet bigger luck. Thats not all, he is doing unlogic things (like letting an invisible remoteable-car middle in the way to a main entrence), well at least if he is not flirting to one of the everywhere appearing good looking girls - in words: James Bond became a pure action movie, maybe with good stunts, sexy women and even better explosion effects but without any trace of real James Bond movies. Well, do not expect to much and you may enjoy it. But I recommend to wait until you see it on TV...\"', '\"DISCLAIMER - This is not an analytical, intellectual review.  Y\\'know why? Because this is not an intellectual movie and it CERTAINLY should not be analyzed.I don\\'t do this comment thing very often, but I felt the need to comment on \"Charlie\\'s Angels.\"  I had the most FUN seeing this movie!  And I think I enjoyed it so much because all I expected was FUN.  I didn\\'t expect anything realistic or Oscar-worthy.  If you go into this movie expecting realism, you\\'ll HATE it.  It\\'s just a blast to watch.  I laughed my butt off, and loved the fight scenes (again, NOT realistic). I just loved it.  And I wanna see it again.  \\'Cause it was FUN.\"', '\"My Take: An enjoyable political thriller set amongst turbulent times combines paranoia and cinematic thrills. With THE HUNT FOR RED October, PATRIOT GAMES and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER before it, CIA analyst turned spy hero Jack Ryan returns (and even hits the Fountain of Youth) in this fourth adaptation of another TOM Clancy bestseller, in which certainly the most relevant of the time. With the ominous and unforgettable events of 9/11 behind it, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS has become more than a mere adaptation of Clancy\\'s bestselling novel, and more of a warning of one of the world\\'s greatest fears: international terrorism. And while this thriller doesn\\'t especially crackle until the second half, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS is still a terrific thriller with crisp plotting and crackling tension.However, in comparison with its hit predecessors, SUM doesn\\'t compare to those highly superior previous films (which I really liked). Firstly, the film\\'s approach as a \"prequel\" really leaves much plot-holes and time-lapses as it goes. While it is a prequel to the original films, SUM takes place during modern time. Instead of bringing back Alec Baldwin or Harrison Ford to portray the role of CIA analyst Jack Ryan, producers opted for a much younger Ben Affleck who, while offering his best, is quite a disappointment, considering that his predecessors Baldwin and Ford are so much better, and sometimes his pretty-boy attitude gets in the way of the accurate CIA character we since have come to know. In this prequel, Ryan is still courting his future wife Cathy Muller (Bridget Moynahan) and has only just graduated from a CIA historian to analyst.For his first CIA job, Ryan is asked by then-CIA director Bill Cabot (Morgan Freeman) to accompanying him on a meeting with the new president of Russia, who is believed to be a hardliner. At the same time, they are sent to survey a nuclear base, where Ryan discovers that some of the scientists are missing. The people in-charge give a logical explanation, but Ryan knows there\\'s something behind it all. At his quest for the truth may just lead him to the discovery of a nuclear bomb being detonated in a Baltimore Football game, in one of the film\\'s landmark moment. The said moment may be the most show-stopping scene in the entire picture, but the rest of the film is as much a thriller is it should. Director Phil Alden Robinson does a superb job providing the tension that comes with the crackling plot, even if it leaves much to be desired when it comes to romantic moments between a young Jack and Cathy.While comparison rises between this and its predecessors, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS turns out to be the thriller it promises to be. Packed with crisp plotting and smart thrills, this is one of the more satisfying summer thrillers. Switch your brain on and pop this in your DVD.Rating: **** out of 5.The DVD: The film is featured in a 2.35:1 widescreen format guaranteed to fit the screen, and the picture quality seems clear except for some scenes shot in the dark. Special features include Audio Commentaries (with director Robinson, cinematographer John Lindley and one with novelist/executive producer Tom Clancy) as well as a trailer. Includes English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai subtitles as well as English and Thai languages. It\\'s also featured in a crisp Dolby Digital sound, so if your sound systems up for it, the nuclear explosion scene will be a real knockout in this new DVD. Also included in the JACK RYAN DVD COLLECTION along with the first three Ryan films.\"', '\"i thoroughly enjoyed the first one. this movie was not even one and a half hours long. a complete waste of $11. i would not reccomend this movie to anyone. one on the annoying things about the movie, was that will smith (ex-nypd) keeps using these high tech terms for guns, and just comes off as a hard ass instead of the meek, funny person as in MIB I.maybe next time you could make the movie a little bit longer and realistic.\"', '\"I must first say this about this movie, it is an awesome action movie.  Then you look at the director (John Woo) and it explains it.  I am struggling with the fact that it didn\\'t seem like a sequel to Mission Impossible.  The reason for this is that there was so much action and stunts that it just did not seem like what it was.  I enjoyed the movie throughout, but I just cannot get over how much different it was.  Still go see it.\"', '\"I loved this in the Cinema although I think it loses a little when you watch it at home, although the DVD is one of the best I\\'ve ever seen, its packed with extras and even has an audio commentary by Brosnan, none of the other Bond actors bothered to do that, if they were asked that is? . Its a very over the top Bond film like You Only Live Twice or Moonraker so if you don\\'t like those sort of Bond films then you probably won\\'t like Die Another Day. I thought it was very good, Halle Berry looks fabulous and is an Oscar winning actress which no other Bond girl can claim to be. Some of the action sequences are superb especially the car chase on ice, its superb. Some dodgy CGI spoils things though, Bond films shouldn\\'t need CGI as they have always led the way in stunts and action scenes, no other Hollywood movies come close apart from Swarzeneggers films with James Cameron at the helm. Brosnan is great in Die Another Day he just IS 007 now, sadly if rumours are to be believed this is his final 007 film, I think only GoldenEye is better than this one with Brosnan as Bond. Eric Bana or whoever takes over has a tough act to follow. One thing that does irk me a little about Die Another Day is the invisible car, I think that is very hard to swallow even for a 007 film it makes some of the gadgets in Roger Moore\\'s films to be believable like the crocodile suits and submarines disguised as icebergs. Actually its fun to notice some old gadgets as 007 meets Q, who again is played by John Cleese. All in all a great Bond film thats not for everyone, as some of the other comments here prove! ***7/10***\"', '\"I could put some thought into this. But why bother? The creators of the movie obviously didn\\'t. Just let it be known that the audience that I saw this trash with began openly mocking it within 2 minutes and (I\\'m not kidding here) LINED UP TO SPIT ON THE SCREEN when it was over. Truly the most bizarre movie going experience I have ever had.\"', '\"Excellent performance by Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. I really liked Owen Wilson\\'s humor. Very good costumes. The scene in the bath tub, while chon and roy are taking bath, drinking and playing chinese drinking game is the high light of the movie. The film was hysterical and I highly recommend it for a good laugh and clean fun!\"', '\"I\\'ve nothing more to say that this is THE awful movie of the year.. it is a great disappointment.i expected more than \"bang bang\"sex sex\" on Bruckeimer\\' and Bay\\'s Films.nothing more than a great insult of who might like hip hop groups and just a reenforcement on what \"hip hop\" means for high class society:Crap Cya.Nighthawk. France;Paris.\"', '\"Things explode. Women are scantily clad. Cheesy jokes are uttered. Evil-Megalomaniac villains plot and scheme and blow things up.  This movie isn\\'t exactly a piece earth-shattering cinematic brilliance, but when you\\'re in the mood for things exploding without being bogged down with things like plot or thematic coherence, it\\'s immensely satisfying.\"', '\"I loved this movie. I had a great time seeing it and felt it was a good night out and worth the time and money to see it on the big screen. The audience reacted along with it, especially those who grew up with the original series. The sound track kept you going and made you envious of the screen (come on girls, didn\\'t you want to jump in and fight along with them?). The humor, the style, the players all made it a great entertaining film. The action and stunts really kept you interested. If you want to see something to just have fun with, see this movie. If you are looking to tear it apart, then leave it alone. And everyone, stick around at the credits at the end. It is worth it.\"', '\"Action / Drama / Comedy all rolled into oneBad Boys I & II are best action packed movies of their time, I can watch it over and over (and have). The combination of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is superb... Great mix of Comedy, Action and Drama, the stuff action movies are meant to be.When you buy/rent this movie be prepared to sit on the edge of your set and be Wowed. The special effects are incredible. I\\'m hoping that Mr. Bay will make another one and Smith, Lawrence and Union stick with it, but this time work on as case that takes them to New York to help out on a case that has to do with Terrorism. Now that would give you plenty of material for Action and the Drama and Comedy will follow.Great Job Guys.\"', '\"Definitely a John Woo film, lots of good stunts and action. Tom Cruise gets to do even more physical stunts Woo does a good job with that. Too many holes in the plot, though, and too long a film for as little ground as it covers. The acting is adequate, could have used more Ving Rhames.\"', '\"I don\\'t know what it was about this movie that I liked so much..... I in fact may be one of the few.... But that Vin Diesel is HOT and Paul Walker ain\\'t too bad himself, so it made for a decent movie.  I admit that Gone in 60 seconds was a better movie due to the story line, but I\\'ll watch Fast and The Furious over and over again just to see Vin Diesel.\"', '\"I loved this movie!  The cars were great!  I saw it with my friends and they loved it too.  The story was pretty good, they talked like people really do in society today, and they had great stunts.  If you buy one movie in the next month it should be The Fast and The Furious.  Oh yeah, and it doesnt matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning IS winning.\"', '\"This movie is just what you would expect if you put Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson in the same film.  Funny, good fights, nothing thought-provoking, but hey, what do you want?  A great piece of fun to see on a lazy summer afternoon.\"', '\"Although the story line has been altered some from the original movie, it still keeps you on your toes and offers some great humor throughout.The cast is great...Clooney & Pitt work well together and do a solid job of feeding off each other\\'s personality & screen character.I don\\'t think the movie gets old and I recommend it be purchased for your home DVD collection.  Don\\'t buy the VHS, definitely get the DVD for the deleted scenes and director\\'s commentary.\"', '\"Singleton\\'s homage and modern day Shaft is an entertaining movie. Its not perfect, definitely flawed, from Wright\\'s hilarious performances as People Hernandez, to the lines Samuel L. Jackson uses, to the whole feel of it, at times it did feel like a long sitcom. However it is always entertaining and exciting, and thats more than i can say for some other movies. I thought the cast did well, and basically saved Singleton, as the film seemed put together kind of lazy and rode the reputations of those involved. Still, it was a good movie, and i think its worth a look. Jeffrey Wright has some hilarious lines like \"this is Italian leather, worth more than half your shitty paycheck\" to the cops. hahaIMDb Rating: 5.9- MY Rating: 8/10\"', '\"I just waisted exactly 88 minutes of my life watching a way...STUPID movie, and just waisted my money, when I could have saved it for something that would benefit me not somethin\\' you  have to be tortured by.I loved Men IN Black 1 but I HATED Men In Black 2!

Try as I might, I simply couldn\\'t bring myself to stay awake and while some part of that may have been due to the manly pillow I was snuggled next to, I put to you that many a film HAS held my attention despite the invitation of unconsciousness.To start, while every Bond film has its outlandish suspend-disbelief-and-hang-on-for-the-ride scenes, the ones in this film just didn\\'t appear realistic, nor particularly original. Were they supposed to be a throw-back to films of 30 years ago before modern special effects? (To whit, Bond surfing the mini-tsunami. By which I mean the second surfing exhibition in the movie, as if the first weren\\'t enough.) Though this explanation would work to assuage some part of my grievance, it appears that nobody involved in this movie\\'s conception put that much thought into it.Second, how could I have walked away with the impression of Bond as blundering in his ineptitude? Yes, he is a fabulous surfer and stunt car driver, but these scenes were unrealistic and thus, easily dismissed. The movie starts with him being caught and held in captivity, and yet he never actually figures out who betrayed him. Rather the villain finally reveals what an idiot the both of them are about 40 hours into this film: Bond for never figuring anything out, and he for taking the time to educate Bond rather than simply killing him. (Yes, this is a common motif, but at some level we do want our hero to display some cunning rather than just accepting that his foes will ultimately self-destruct. Again, this film may have benefited from some actual thought.) Third, the film was flat BORING. I don\\'t know if the action scenes were too long, or if I just didn\\'t care about the characters enough to stay focused, but they repeatedly found me nodding off. The only exception was the laser scene which was frightening in its potential for gore, but also comical with Halle Berry yelling at Bond that she\\'s in danger even though he\\'s currently contending with foe while simultaneously dodging numerous laser beams.Finally, Bond rarely seemed capable of actually getting HIMSELF out of scrapes. He spends the entire movie getting either captured, or rescued by women. While this may be progressive, it\\'s not Bond.P.S. Yes, she\\'s Madonna, and it must have been quite a coup to sign her for the movie, but shouldn\\'t they have insisted she produce a decent theme song? Where is the integrity???\"', '\"There used to be a time when going to the theaters and watching James Bond movies was a treat. As one critics said, James Bond\\'s world is a world like ours but kind of a parallel universe where things are little bit brighter and more brilliant than this one that we live in. Now James Bond lives in a world just like our own. In fact he looks just as worn out and busy as the rest of us who wakes up in the morning and goes to work, being chased by the endless details and speed of the information age. So why the heck do we have to go to Bond any more to find an escape from our life for 90 minutes ? Transcendental meditation may even be a better alternative to find a place where we can be free from our daily lives.Bond girls are really average too for this and previous four or so movies. What\\'s funny is James Bond spoof Mike Myers in the Goldmember has better looking girls than James Bond, and watching Mike Myers is more of transporting experience than watching the original Bond.So I could see why James Bond franchise is suffering these days. It stopped being the brighter world that we wished our daily life was like.\"', '\"I wonder how it is people can say they not only thought this movie was good, but that they actually enjoyed it as well. It was so dull and boring I often felt like vomiting, as it contained the creativity of a Steven Segal movie.The acting was on the wrong side of awful and the story was so lacking in substance, you had to question who was in charge of such a rubble. The names are solely what got this movie made which is a sad day for the wasted talent pool of writers out there who can\\'t get someone to back their original work.See it if you must, but remember, your better off going outside and crumbling leaves in your hands for two hours.\"', '\"Overall it\\'s a good movie, I like this type of movies. I wouldn\\'t se it again but I enjoy it when I saw the movie. Good actor.\"', '\"This movie was very entertaining.  It had me wanting to watch all the way until the end.  It was about 30 minutes too long I\\'m afraid though.  There were many times that I thought there were scenes that could have been cut and still made this movie funny and with great action.  Some of the parts were a little overacted as well.  All in all I thought this was a good film and I will watch it over and over again for a few scenes.  It does have some horrible language in this movie so do not let you kids see it unless you don\\'t care if they repeat what they see.  Check the movie out if you are of age.  It\\'s a good film.\"', '\"I personally think that this was one of the best recent bond movies - especially the vanquish vs jaguar at the end - but i think that in 2002 the kite surfing scene could have been done much better or removed. Two Thumbs up for all the other scenes, but i think that if something cant get right it better be excluded (ref Kite Surfing)\"', '\"I went with mixed feelings but ended up enjoying it tremendously. This could be due to two possibilities; that at most times it didn\\'t feel like a John Woo movie or that John Woo is as good as some claim him to be.  I would rate this movie a must see.\"', '\"This is definitely and by far the worst Jams Bond movie to date.The plot is non-existent, there is absolutely no character interaction, dialog, we don\\'t get to feel anything for anybody. The whole film is just a collage of special effects and pyrotechnics. And this is where the main problem lies... The special effects and pyrotechnics are by far the worst I have seen in over 20 years, totally unfit for a film made in the 21st century! I mean, even the first Bond movies in the 60\\'s looked much more realistic than this one! Even the Bond girls in the film are terrible. Halle Berry looks so bad in this film, not having been given the chance to show any part of her that is even remotely sexy. The filming and the music during her remake of the \\'Ursulla Andress\\' original \"coming out of the water scene in a bikini\" was so un-sexy it is unbelievable. The camera was so bad, it managed to show all the negative aspects of her figure rather than the positive ones. Not to mention Rosamund Pike, where the only good part of her appearance was that she was named \"Ms Frost\". And the villains... they are funnier than they are mean... for goodness sake, where are the Bond villains of the past?All in all, a total catastrophe, there is not even one aspect of this movie that can be salvaged, from direction, cinematography, acting, all the way down to the musical soundtrack, the only adjective that comes to mind is... pathetic!\"', '\"The first half of this movie is bad.  Sure it\\'s funny, but it brought down the movie. (SPOILERS!!!)\\nIt get\\'s better when they try to kill the angels and everything that follows.  They now have a sense of direction.  X-men is much better in this field.  The movie has no direction at the beginning.  Now I\\'m biased here, (cause I\\'m about the same age as drew, and been a fan since 81 or so...da*n E.T.)but I thought Drew simply kicked A**, in this movie.  She\\'s gotta do more action movies like this.  She totally carried the last half the movie. The DVD is fun too as well.  Couple of everything you can think of. :)3/10 first half 7/10 second half = 5/10\"', '\"Uhhh... didn\\'t they already, like, do all of this in Point Break? Same freakin\\' movie, just not as good. Not that Point Break is \"Raging Bull\" or anything, it\\'s just that this movie (Fast and the Furious) tries SO HARD to make sure that ALL THAT ATTITUDE is RIGHT IN YOUR FACE. Point Break at least had a little laid back surfer dude \\'tude to it (although, we finally figured out that Keanu wasn\\'t actually ACTING in that movie). Plus, Fast and the Furious lacks that world class quote a la \"I. am an EFF-BEE-YI A-gent. I. CANNOT. ROB. a BANK!\" The best The Fast and the Furious can muster is \"If I win, I get the money... AND the respect. That\\'s more important to some people.\" Wow. Thanks for spelling that out.\"', '\"I agree with the current commentator on this site that this movie is generally weak in character development and story; however, I don\\'t believe it\\'s milked. Frank is so damn funny and engrossing, the movie was bound to be a hit. Frankly I love the damn dog. He throws one liners, has great scenes (especially while driving around with J), and even converses naturally about women. The best line has to be \"I\\'m attracted to her and she\\'s not even my species.\" It was clear J was smitten and Frank, ever smitten with J and MIB, called it. He\\'s not a new personality, but he\\'s not old and he\\'s not overused.Tommy Lee Jones is talented and can stretch any character. He starts humorous, which should have been natural and was, before giving way to his prior character. This again was how it should have been - - it was readjustment. Will Smith may have garnered acclaim for \"Ali,\" and regardless of reviews and appearances, looked decent in \"I, Robot;\" moreover, he has grit in this movie. Particularly, he is quite good in the beginning before settling into his typical, but still engaging antics. The Jeff part that transverses to the pie sequence is followed by major desperation in J\\'s character. It\\'s unforeseen and initially awkward; however, as his relationship with Laura festers with possibility it becomes more natural and fitting. K gave that to us in the end of \"Men in Black\" with his obsession of stars. The first movie rushed that and it was a bit contrived, but Jones was able to slow it down and make it work.How J keeps \"Putty\" (come on he has no other name, although he isn\\'t a bad actor) for five months as his partner, is beyond me. Especially because K trains J in two days in the first film. The reason it gets me is how awkward they still are and how dumb he still is (although J hits on this).Before I get to Lara Flynn Boyle, I have to express disappointment in Bo Welch. The costumes of the aliens weren\\'t horrible, but rather really out there and unable to be taken seriously. The first time the aliens were real and the movie rough, but this time it\\'s all about the humor. The aliens designed to bring in K for Lara\\'s character are horrible (a ball-chinian? It\\'s somewhat humorous but it gets ruined when K performs a improbable kick. Even worse is Rip Torn\\'s paddle on Lara Flynn Boyle). The problem with this movie is it is so jokey. I can\\'t stand the automatic driver, and why is a playstation controller the only thing that can commandeer this damn machine at hyperspeed? Overall I love Jack Jeebs, Knoxville\\'s character is forgettable, Ben is cool for five seconds (I get the feeling he cares), Dawson is decent, but K and J are still the men. This movie was focused on J and his definite struggle, not MIB, and that is why the story isn\\'t the focus. But how did David Cross elude being neuralyzed in the first movie? The movie works when the characters act, not when they say choice lines. It\\'s balanced fairly well. And K still throws out some cool guidance to J and leaves the possibility for a MIB III, or MIIIB, if so desired.Lara Flynn Boyle is not bad, but the woman in power line is just poorly delivered, but fitting because it is Men in Black. She honestly seems dumb because she wastes 25 years and still doesn\\'t locate the light; Knoxville\\'s character does. She works though, especially toward the end and is bright enough to use her sexuality to her advantage. Not to mention her stuffing her face is kind of funny to keep tracking. And the robot alien is wickedly, wickedly cool (while K and J are apparently clairvoyant). Mostly I say enjoy this movie because you should laugh and you get a decent story.\"', '\"This is a good sequel, better than I expected it to be but the first movie is still better than this one. I was disappointed about a few things including the time length. This movie takes place five years after the first movie. Agent J has to bring back Agent K because only K knows about the mysterious \"Light\" object.\" They have to prevent the evil Serleena from stealing this object. Some of their allies include the famous worms and the singing Frank the pug. The cast did a great job with their parts. I liked Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as the Men in Black dudes. Lara Flynn Boyle did a pretty good job as the wicked Seleena. I also have to give heads up to Johnny Knoxville as he proves that he can act. The music by Danny Elfman is great and appropriate for this movie. The movie has some comedy too. It was nice to crack up here or there. I was displeased at the time length. This movie was way too short for a movie in a genre such as Sci-Fi. Overall, this is a great sequel and I recommend this. I rate this movie 9/10.\"', '\"Die Another Day is absolute garbage. I really feel sorry for Pierce Brosnan because I believe he wasn\\'t far off being the greatest Bond but unfortunately he came around a period where the scripts were plain awful. I don\\'t include Goldeneye in that of course.I don\\'t even know where to begin criticising this film. It was obviously part of the big 40th Anniversary of Bond at the time of release and I think it was common knowledge that bits and bobs of the last 19 films were to be included. Those parts were the only thing that kept me interested in this movie and even at that I had a yawn every so often. It\\'s all very well saying that Bond works well because of the mixture of gadgets and girls etc but it was clear to me they needed a proper storyline and a proper villain. Toby Stephens was just lost throughout the whole film. It was difficult to remember he was Bonds adversary. If they were thinking about recreating the Zorrin character in some form Toby Stephens fell way below par. As far as the storyline goes, even the back of the DVD doesn\\'t explain it. All I can realistically remember about the film is that Bond gets set up and works outside the confines of MI6 because they don\\'t believe him. What happened for the next two hours apart from the rip offs of previous Bond films is a mystery to me. Apparently New Zealand Director Tamahori was confident in taking Bond into the new millennium. In that case he must be trying to kill off Bond soon because this was a major step in the execution of the slick stylish Secret Agent. Final note, Producer Michael G Wilson stated that there were two elements to a Bond film, namely character and a story. No character struck me and I think someone lost the story in that expensive Ice Palace. It was disappointing to hear Pierce Brosnan had been dropped for the role of Bond but in any case here\\'s hoping any future Bond film puts this monstrosity to rest.\"', '\"If you have trouble following this Mission Impossible, I\\'m sorry, but you are most definitely an idiot.  This movie is SO obvious, from the plot to the action sequences, that it makes watching it about as boring as synchronized swimming.  Every \"twist\" is seen in advance, every little crazy action sequence (excluding the cool hand-to-hand, which is obviously Woo\\'s forte in that he makes Tom Cruise look like Bruce Lee) could have been scripted by anyone who has seen multiple Bond films, and every string tied to the romantic storyline is too sappy to be real.  The writers are obviously too used to half-hour storylines, and the director too good at Hong Kong action flicks to reduce himself to this trash.  Even the remade theme song deserves a knockdown.  I\\'m sorry people, but this movie sucks. Go watch the first one again, and don\\'t bother with this lackluster attempt at filmmaking.\"', '\"The casting coup, though not quite matching up to K3G, would still draw big crowds. Hopping onto the bandwagon is Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich), the flavour of the year 2000.\\nThe movie is a re-make of a 1960s one with same name, starring the \\'Ratpack\\' led by Frank Sinatra. In short, the story deals with eleven men joining hands to loot three casinos in Las Vegas (where else?). The plot and cast arousing a good deal of interest, Soderbergh wouldn\\'t need to worry about marketing. After an initial good pace, the movie slightly slows down and then picks up steam in the second half. The planning and execution of the robbery are impressive, with some surprises and subtle humour packed in. Some glaring loop-holes and cliches in the screenplay become forgivable. Clooney strides his part like a king, while Pitt is stylish. The rest are adequate in their small roles. Soderbergh maintains his trademark slick and realistic narration, aided by intelligent editing.\\nOverall, an enjoyable movie, enhanced by the presence of big stars.\"', '\"this is a guys movie,but it\\'s good, basically its just guns,crashes and beautiful women but its entertaining, i\\'ll admit the story it\\'s not as good as the first one, in the first movie they focus on the story and on the action, in this one they focus more on the action but it\\'s still good. it has great action sequences and its very funny, will smith and martin Lawrence are very funny , they have great chemistry on screen, the only thing i didn\\'t like was the end, that guy blowing up in the landmine after he was shot in the head i think was a little to much, but besides that this movie is very entertaining and funny, i think its because they use a lot of profanity. so if you are home on Saturday night go rent this movie, you\\'ll have a good time.\"', '\"The Fast and the Furious is bad. Not only bad, but painfully bad.The film contains no plot, no people that can act, no directing, no good anything. Nice cars, though. Is that the only thing that counts to make a film today?I\\'m angry over the fact that they spent millions of dollars on this \"movie\", when there are so much better ways of spending the dollars, like betting them in Las Vegas, maybe. You\\'d probably get more in return too.\\nSo who is responsible for this? Lets see... The director, Rob Cohen, has made such increadible films as The Skulls (yuck!) and Daylight (HAHAHAHA!). The writer, or should I say writers, made such crap as Hollow Man and Split Second (Gary Scott Thompson). The other writers can\\'t boost with such \"successes\". :)Maybe I shouldn\\'t \"review\" this boring and superembarrasing flick, because I turned it off after a while. I just couldn\\'t stand it. Where\\'s the fun in watching cars with lights under them, girls with \"almost no clothes\" and guys with stupid hair, if there is no action, no story and, well... nothing else at all?If you like to watch girls with bikini-looking clothes and colorful vehicles, this is for you. If you have some sort of brains though, and need something more to be entertained, then don\\'t bother with this sorry excuse for a movie.I\\'ve seen wallpaper that is more entertaining than this.1 out of 10.\"', '\"Ok, I thought the hokey \"love at first sight\" thing was ridiculous and the action scenes were too hard to believe. I know this is a movie and therefore not real, however, some of these scenes may as well have been fantasy. There should be some hint of probability to be truly suspenseful, otherwise you end up laughing throughout the whole thing. I was not expecting the love story plot and I think it ruined it rather than making it interesting. The slow-motion was a little funky as well.\"', '\"This is an awesome movie with the best ending ever!  The entire movie is exciting...there is never a dull moment; you\\'ll be on the edge of your seat throughout the movie.  I definitely recommend seeing this movie.  You\\'ll enjoy it.\"', '\"`Charlie\\'s Angels\\', for the uninitiated, is about the mysterious, unseen Charlie (voice by John Forsythe) and his band of three glamorous private investigators:  Dylan (Drew Barrymore), Natalie (Cameron Diaz), and Alex (Lucy Liu).  The Angels, under the occasional direction of the bumbling Bosley (Bill Murray), solve mysteries and kick the crap out of villains. In this particular film (probably the first of many . . . shudder), the mystery involves computers and some high-tech voice recognition software.  The story never gets much more complicated than that, as the entire plot is simply a MacGuffin to link the comedy scenes and action scenes together into a reasonable facsimile of an actual film.The saving graces of `Charlie\\'s Angels\\' are Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu.  As Natalie, Diaz exudes the right amounts of bubbly, air-headed charm and toughness to make her genuinely funny Â– and genuinely appealing.  Diaz is clearly the star of `Charlie\\'s Angels\\', and she makes the most of what she\\'s given.  Lucy Liu\\'s portrayal of Alex is also dead-on great; she\\'s hell on wheels with a sharp tongue and deadly wit. (The scene where she impersonates a leather-clad corporate trainer is possibly the best in the film).  Once you get past Diaz and Liu, though, there\\'s not much left worth watching. Drew Barrymore is horrible as the supposedly street-tough Dylan; she\\'s not sexy, she\\'s not sympathetic, and she certainly doesn\\'t come across as tough. Barrymore would be doing herself a huge favor as producer if she bowed out of the film and let somebody else take her place (my replacement vote is for Eliza Dushku of `Buffy\\' and `Bring It On\\' fame).  Crispin `McFly\\' Glover is a waste as one of the main villains, Bill Murray doesn\\'t do anything but mug for the cameras, Tom Green is simply annoying . . . the list of bad performances goes on and on.  Toss that in with the witless plot and the action sequences stolen straight out of `The Matrix\\' and the entire Jet Li film catalog, and the result is a whole exciting lot of nothing.If you\\'re truly compelled to watch this movie, just rent (not buy) the DVD, so you can shoot straight to the few good scenes prominently featuring Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu.  The rest of the movie\\'s not worth watching. It\\'s sad when it seems like a film is dragging . . . and it\\'s only 98 minutes long.  Grade: D\"', '\"OCEAN\\'s ELEVEN is a cool, slick comedy!Let me be brief. It features smooth performances by all (stand-outs include Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Carl Reiner). Steven Soderbergh\\'s direction is inventive. Finally, Ted Griffin\\'s screenplay is snappy and funny.If you want to have a good ol\\' time at the movies, check out this solid hit.\"', '\"Hearing quite a good review on BBC\\'s Film 2002, I agreed whole-heartedly with it, so just to recap. There\\'s quite an element of darkness in this Bond, with a whole opening section devoted to his capture, torture and even betrayal. It\\'s a side to the normal infallible Bond that we rarely see, and to be honest it worked quite well. Combining this with the villain that actually seems like he could really kill Bond, I mean really. Coupled with some nice surprises, and Bond showing some real unfettered hatred, it\\'s not exactly like the other Bond filmsÂ…but then, it is. For there are the action sequences, which are spectacular, the amazing storyline, and some stunning Bond girls. All in all, an excellent Bond, which should rank up with the top five of all time, with Brosnan showing he should be in the top two Bonds of all time.\"', '\"I like this movie.  Tom Cruise is an amazing actor and he\\'s good in it, though he looks sexier in the previous.  Anthony Hopkins is more attractive than Tom Cruise in a way.  I was impressed by the intelligence The British English he spoke.  He just sounds like such a sophiscated person.(Actually he is)  Not all British people are able of it apparently.  Are you?  Are people going to make the next one?  If they are, I\\'d be glad to watch it.  I can\\'t help it.  Every major essence of this movie is so amazing.\"', '\"I think Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond since Connery.  But this film is majorly disappointing, but it\\'s not Brosnan that\\'s disappointing.  Brosnan does fine.  It\\'s the addition of Halle Berry that distracts from Bond.  The Bond films started out as just that - Bond movies showing James Bond\\'s many facets.  Now he has to compete with Halle Berry for his one-liners.I heard a rumor that Die Another Day setup Jinx Johnson as an offshoot from Bond.  That would be fine if we could just be rid of her in the Bond flims. She can go off and do her own thing or whatever she likes and leave the Bond films to Bond fans.  Jinx can set up her own following, but please leave the Bond films in the Ian Fleming tradition of showing James Bond in his own glory without competing for attention in the same film.Hopefully Halle Berry will leave the series and go off and do her own thing elsewhere.  If not, it may be the beginning of the demise of the Bond films. I suppose we\\'ll find out in \"Bond 21\" in November 2005.\"', '\"Michael Bay can blow almost anything up and still make it look good on camera, and this he insists for almost 3 hours in BAD BOYS II. I\\'ve purposely avoided this overstuffed, overlong sequel to Bay\\'s first film BAD BOYS. I don\\'t hate Michael Bay nor his approach of mindless and over-amped blockbusters, but I wouldn\\'t want to waste my time on the 2 and a half hours of empty-headed drivel that BAD BOYS II had to offer. But when it was on TV, and with time to spare, I thought it couldn\\'t be all that bad. I mean, I\\'m probably one of the few people who like a Bay\\'s Armageddon or PEARL HARBOR.And yet, despite a few enjoyable moments, it really was THAT bad. The action is brisk and exciting at first, but then it goes on and on and on until Bay has nothing more to blow up. The filler of a story (I tried my best not to refer to it as a \"plot\") concerns our Narcotic agent heroes Marcus (Will Smith) and Mike (Martin Lawrence) going after a drug kingpin (Jordi Molla). But it\\'s really just an empty barrage of action scene after action scene, each one bigger than the last. Worse, Bay can\\'t help thinking of himself as an auteur by shooting the action sequences in either slow-mo (a trick he over uses here) or with fast cuts that make it almost impossible to know what\\'s happening.BAD BOYS II is so loud and obnoxious that Bay couldn\\'t even keep it down a notch during the \"talking\" scenes (in Bay\\'s world, everyone talks trash). Plus the idea of humor in the movie is beyond tasteless. Smith and Lawrence\\'s banter are occasionally amusing, but a chase sequence where Smith and Lawrence run over a couple of corpses dropping from a truck or a scene where they see two rats having sex in a graphic manner are just too much (and painfully, there are more). I find no problem with a big, loud, and dumb blockbuster, but BAD BOYS II insists that it can bigger, louder, and dumber than usual. It represents the most aimless attempt any blockbuster could commit: aim low and miss desperately. This is Bay\\'s worst movie until his recent TRANSFORMERS sequel.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.\"', '\"Another cash cow sequel! An incredibly poor script with very low standards of acting. Although not my genre, i kind of liked the first Men in Black. But this is incredibly stupid. Thanks God (really thanks to IMDB for providing ratings and comments) i didnt go to watch this at the cinema. Got it on DVD and i still feel i was seriously ripped off!\"', '\"Well as I expected from the previews, it was not, in my mind, a Mission Impossible movie. There was great action (only after about 3/4\\'s of the whole movie), great acting, ok plot, but the aspect of a mission with tonnes of twists and turns and intricate details that only people with high tech gadgets can acomplish is just not there. I think the writes realized this and threw in a few fake mask scenes (too many in my mind) but that is pretty much the extent of it. If it were an action movie, I would have given it an 8 maybe 9, but calling it Mission Impossible 2 is just not right (hence my rating of 5)\"', '\"I must admit the three Angels- Liu, Diaz, and Barrymore were not bad choices. But looking at the classic 1970s and 1980s TV show, you have to say that this movie was strictly made for movie gross and money. It has little resemblance to the TV show and is more of a mockery instead of a movie. I hope this doesn\\'t foreshadow to more silly movies based on TV shows because I hope NYPD Blue nor The Practice have such poor followings. It has good action and a good choice for a Friday Night Movie, but the only thing really sweet is the Movie Trailer and Destiny\\'s Child\\'s music theme song \"All The Women.\"\"', '\"A fine waste of 59 minutes, I just wish it had lasted that long.  This is vintage John Woo fare replete with all the necessary martial arts action (double kicks to the side of the head galore), drawn out fight scenes in which the good guy beats up at least ten bad, bad men and a hokey ending (yes, there were clowns).

There WAS a lot of humor that made me laugh, but other than that, and as usual the unnecessary sexual content, I really didn\\'t see the point of the movie. The special effects were great, but it still lacked a good story. The first one introduced the MIB and showed them on many adventures. The second one just involved one alien trying to take over the planet, nothing new and exciting unfortunately.Rated 6/10, 2/10 for lack of creative story, 2/10 for sexual content, and 2/10 for swearing.\"', '\"All I can say about this film is that\\'s one of the best racing films I\\'ve seen in years, the use of sound is amazing the engines roar from here there and everywhere, yeah so the story maybe a bit thin and it may seem that you are watching the film version of the game Driver.  But all in all it\\'s a none stop thrill of fast cars and brilliant action sequences from the great Rob Cohen (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story), My recommendation is that if you haven\\'t seen it then WHY NOT.\"', '\"What happened to Barry Sonnenfeld?  He made three great and funny films: Addams Family, Addams Family Values and Men in Black and then what?  Did he have a nervous breakdown?  Lose his funny friend who was the true inspiration?  Who knows?  Wild, Wild West is crap, Big Trouble wasn\\'t much better and Men In Black II just plain stinks.And I\\'m not sure what\\'s happened to Will Smith either...is it just that we\\'ve seen his schtick in an action movie (Independence Day) and in a comedy (Men in Black) and it\\'s just not interesting any more?  Maybe if he\\'d do something in a different genre, he might be funny again.  Will go find a musical or mystery -- please don\\'t do anymore comedies.  You are no longer funny.In any case, Men in Black II is the longest hour & a half I\\'ve spent in a theater in a long time and I want my time back.  Bad plot, characters who were developed in the first film fall completely flat in the sequel, and no one\\'s funny.  Oh yeah, and there\\'s a lame, unfunny cameo from Michael Jackson -- who cares?If you\\'ve seen the trailers, you\\'ve seen the best parts: the post office with the human/alien beatbox dialogue; Frank singing in the car, and J\\'s quip about the white \"auto pilot\" driver.  Skip the movie,  see the trailer again.  Trust me, the trailer for Men in Black II is the\"', '\"Funnily enough MIBII wasn\\'t the crap-o-rama I was expecting. It sure isn\\'t going to win any oscars, but it isn\\'t as bad as its made out to be.There are a few decent gags in here. A few made me laugh out loud. They were usually the more understated ones as the big, obvious ones were a big lame (the michael jackson bit was a arse clenchingly unfunny).\\nThe plot concerns some bad alien looking for something that was supposed to do something, which the MIB were supposed to have got rid of but never did. Ho hum. And the only way to do it is to rescue the \\'buddy\\' formula that worked so well in the first film and ditch Linda Fiorentino as J\\'s partner. In the most hideous way. We sit there wondering what happened to her for like 20 odd minutes and all we get is \\'you cant keep neuralizing your partners, J\\' \\'She wanted to go back to the morgue\\'. A single line. Poor woman.Speaking of poor women, J\\'s new love interest, who may or may not be K\\'s daughter, he doesn\\'t seem to really give a crap, is in the film for a grand total of about 2 minutes. And she is the pivotal plot device.\\nAnyway, K makes a return at about the 40 odd minute mark which gives him about another 40 mins to get his thang back. This means TLJ\\'s glowering and scowling like he just sniffed a turd for about 35 mins, before he mellows at the ending. He just does nothing. He spends 20 minutes claiming he isn\\'t an MIB and then another 20 being boring. He seems to substitute deadpan for morose (acting like you do when you are a kid and forced to visit your gran) losing all the spark he and Will Smith had in the original. Speaking of Will Smith his character goes from Ultimate bad ass MIB agent to Ultimate Jackass MIB agent when K shows up, just to get the \\'rookie\\' thing going. Which is anoying.All the ingredients are there from the original, but just don\\'t click. There are too many plot holes, too much contradiction and not enough characterisation. Its like how George Lucas has forgotten what made star wars so good, Sonnenfield seems to have stuck to the blueprint but gone wrong somehow. Maybe it would have been better if he wasn\\'t so fervent about his magic \\'90 minute mark\\' for films. If we had an extra 15 odd minutes it could have been so much different. Maybe he would have had time for a decent ending...Actually, reading back, I enjoyed this less than I thought I did. How strange.\"', '\"In 1971 John Shaft butt-kicked his way though NYC to retrieve a kidnapped Pimp\\'s daughter.In 2000, His nephew butt-kicks through NYC in a more modern story.I recently saw the original and I realized just now that this 2000 \"Remake\" is actually a continuation of the story. After all, there were two sequels in 1972 and 73: \"Shaft\\'s big Score\" and \"Shaft in Africa\"Richard Roundtree is STILL John Shaft. He is wearing the same turtleneck and brown leather jacket. He\\'s still the \"Private Dick who\\'s the sex machine with all the chicks\". But this film focuses on his nephew Samuel L Jackson is also John Shaft, an NYPD Detective that gets fed up with the system when murderer Christian Bale walks and so he goes out and gets Bale himself, using all sorts of clever tricks on the bad guys.Someone posted a comment that this film was un-original, but entertaining. Hell, nothing is original, and so I rate this film high cos it IS entertaining. It is well directed, and as such is swell Homage to Gordon Parks... Who directed the first Shaft film and is in this film as the club patron named \"Mister P\" All this being said: It is a long way from 1971 to 2000, almost 30 years: So, this 2000 \"Continuation\" is not as big a deal as the original was. But that don\\'t make it any less good. I liked this film and I liked the original Shaft.\"', '\"Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actor. My first is Denzel Washinton, and my third favorite is Dan Aykroyd. I really liked this film because (1) Morgan Freeman was in it, (2) it had a really good plot with the right actors. It was a really great movie, but they should have waited a little bit after Setember 11, 2001. I really suggest that you see this film, it\\'s a masterpiece.\"', '\"I love FAST AND FURIOUS movies, so I thought, \"What if I reviewed these movies?\", so I will review each film from the original film to the new film.So, I begin my second franchise review with the original 2001 film, The Fast and the Furious.The Fast and the Furious was not only released on June 22, 2001 to financial success and mixed reviews, but it also launched the careers of nearly all of it\\'s stars, including Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, who would later become household names, as well as Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez.The film is directed by Rob Cohen with a screenplay by David Ayer, who wrote the 2001 film Training Day and co-wrote this film with two other writers including the creator of the franchise, Gary Scott Thompson.The film follows undercover cop Brian O\\'Conner who must stop semi-truck hijackers led by criminal and wanted fugitive Dominic Toretto from stealing expensive electronic equipment while developing a relationship with Dominic\\'s sister, Mia Toretto and forming a friendship with Dominic.That is just a quick summary. I won\\'t go into too much of the plot, because a lot of people should know what is the main premise of the story in this film and the other Fast and Furious movies. The franchise would later go to move away from the underground street racing plot into a plot much more cooler with the heist of $100 million dollars, gun fights and brawls and the movie that would change this franchise and bring new life into it would be the fifth entry in the series, released in April of 2011, Fast Five.The story is just really cool and amazing, but is not Oscar worthy, but the dialogue is the movie can get a little weak on a few occasions, but not throughout the whole darn movie.The action is just top-notch and the car chases in this film is as intense and action-packed as they would be later on in the franchise. My favorite car chase is at the beginning of the film and at the end of the film involving Dominic and Brian driving.The acting is just dreadful, but not all of it is. I will give credit to Vin Diesel, who plays Dominic Toretto and he pulls it off wonderfully, but while it\\'s not Oscar worthy, he does show emotion, drama and laughter into his character. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, is great in this film and she would remain in that part for the other films and she would play in James Cameron\\'s groundbreaking special-effects extravaganza Avatar and in the 2002 action-horror / zombie movie film based on the survival video game, Resident Evil.The other two that also does a great job is definitely Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, who plays Brian O\\'Conner and Mia Toretto, and they do a very decent good job with the material written for them and they have such a great chemistry on the screen.Dominic Toretto\\'s team members are just good. The actors who play the people in his crew is just incredible, with the exception of Matt Schulze as Vince.The music and soundtrack is really cool and Ja Rule is in this film, playing the role of Edwin and he provides music on the soundtrack.Overall, The first and original FAST AND THE FURIOUS is really good, but can get a little confusing in a few areas. I give it a 6 out of 10. It\\'s not the best score, but certainly not the worst. This film is worth the watch and worth buying on DVD and Blu-Ray or watching on basic cable and Video on Demand or Xfinity Streampix.\"', '\"In a post September 11 world, who wants to see terrorist attacks against the United States?You will.I\\'ve always been something of a fan of \"cold war\" movies, one of my favorites is \"Fail Safe\" (the original). Certain scenes in this movie brought back some of those same eerie, tense moments. There was no point where I was wincing at glaringly obvious CG.Although there are a very few bumpy spots, this ride is worth taking.Although Ben Affleck would NOT have been my choice as Jack Ryan, he still puts out a credible performance. Unfortunately, like many current actors, he tends to react more than act, but hey, we\\'re starting to get used to this in today\\'s movies.The story ramps up smoothly enough, accelerating to full speed quickly. We are privy to all three sides of the conflict, and it is paced very well.The theater I saw this in was packed completely full, and yet at the quiet scenes (powerful dramatic silence, actually) there wasn\\'t a word, cough, rustle or movement. It grabs you that hard.This is one of the best movies I\\'ve seen in a long time, it was believable and intense. It makes you think... it could happen, right? It could, and you really want it to NOT happen.\"', '\"This movie surprised me to be honest.... As it being a Jackie Chan movie I wasn\\'t expecting much but it actually kept me entertained the whole way through. Now Im not a major fan of old western movies but the chemistry with Chan and Wilson was brilliant and kept me involved with the pace of the film. I thought Owen Wilson played his part excellent as the laid back cowboy, but sadly Chan was the same character as in his other movies. Will his movies ever have a different idea. I know that the point of his movies but for once he could surprise us................. This movie definitely beats Rush Hour 1 but not 2 and probably on an even par with 3. Overall good fun to watch on an easy night in.3 out of 5 stars ***\"', '\"We\\'ve got James Bond having his license to kill taken away (like in License to Kill), some unscrupulous diamond antics (Diamonds Are Forever), and a MI6 agent changing sides (GoldenEye).  Put all this together and you get...a fairly bad Bond movie.  I\\'m not just talking about the lack of realism (Invisible cars and riding a tsunami with a piece of a vehicle and a parachute), or the terrible science (Replacing someone\\'s bone marrow to make them look like someone else), or the rather pointless globetrotting (From Vietnam to Hong Kong to Cuba to England to Iceland).  I\\'m talking about the uninspired sword fight, the new Bond Girl, Madonna (anyone remember Shanghai Surprise?  No?  Okay), some of the incredibly shoddy special effects, and some really pedestrian direction from a director who seems to think making James Bond like XXX will win new fans.  I sincerely hope that they get their act together for the next one.\"', '\"Disclosure:  I\\'m a Bond fan.I think this is my favorite Pierce Brosnan 007 movie, mainly because it starts out with a different feeling because he is cast as a sort of rogue agent.  Icarus is probably the best bad guy\\'s weapon of world domination since, say Moonraker.  The V12 \\'Vanish\\' is an awesome car (the Aston Martin Vanquish is a real car).  The \\'adaptive camaflage\\' feature is one of the coolest, yet (with current developing technologies) most plausible sci-fi ideas of recent films.Downside?  I think the actors are all good, and the 007 series is notoriously punny, but I thought some of the lines/puns were approaching cornball.\"', '\"I was most disappointed with the film and its overzealous attempt to please its audience from what I can only assume is feedback from previous movies. It bared little resemblance to the original Bond film\\'s that came before it and at some stages in the movie displayed a sharp contrast. The use of his car was not limited but overused as it seems to have been an integral part of the film\\'s appeal.The use of special effects in this film were commendable but in some scenes poorly done, with special attention to his parachute flight over the waves in which he is easily seen in front of a screen -- a technique used liberally in older films.The characters in the film were not in my opinion well chosen. The villain lacked any truly recognizable trait nor was it easy to spot who he/she was. The character of Jinx as being an NSA agent was somewhat unnecessary, an attempt I fear to Americanize James Bond films.The film\\'s plot was interesting to say the least. Most of the situations in which James Bond & Jinx found themselves in lacked any connection to even a vague notion of reality, when the film makers drew the line between realism and fantasy they obviously used the thickest marker they could find.I cannot blame the film entirely for its shortcomings as I perceive them, since I expected too much. The movie provided a small helping of good entertainment but in the end turned up lacking in too many respects.\"', '\"Put another win in Pierce Brosnan\\'s column. Again, Pierce reprises James Bond, and he and the filmmakers deliver another entertaining Bond film. Set in locales all over the globe, it starts in North Korea where Bond is captured while attempting an assassination. After 18 months of filth and torture in a North Korean prison, he is released, but as a disgraced agent, now held in custody by British intelligence for revealing secrets under torture. He escapes, and while proving his innocence, the movie leaps to Hong Kong, London, and Cuba before ending in Iceland. There\\'s a plot about a massive killer satellite, Halle Barry as a rival agent and love interest, gadgets galore, and some of the best bad guys to grace a Bond film.\\nMy only complaints are two and minor. First, there are a few too many gadgets; I wish Bond would rely more good old spycraft. And secondly, the locales and sub-plots are better early in the movie. By the time of the final showdown at the Ice Palace in Iceland, the action is getting a little too close to \\'over the top\\'.  But all in all, one of the better Bond movies since Sean gave up the role.\"', '\"I wasn\\'t expecting much from this film but I was pleasantly surprised. The plot may be a little predictable but it was otherwise entertaining due to the sharp script and strong performances from Samuel L Jackson and Busta Rhymes etc. It was a little cliched at times but this was what I was expecting - overall it was better than I expected and I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t see this at the cinema.\"', '\"As funny as the original MIB was, the sequel proves that the same old thing can get very old and very tired very quickly. I mean, how often can you really find it funny to watch an alien grow its head back after having it shot off? This was a cute gag in the original (and I think we only saw it happen once if I remember correctly.) In this one, it happens over and over again. HEY! AFTER THE FIRST TIME IT\\'S NOT THAT FUNNY! That\\'s the basic problem with this movie. It doesn\\'t seem to have a lot to differentiate it from the first one, with the result that it\\'s just not that interesting.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as Agents \"Jay\" and \"Kay\" respectively, and here was one element of the story that might have made this a fun adventure if it had been developed. \"Kay\" is retired as this movie opens, and he\\'s been \"neuralized\" - his memory of having been an MIB agent has been wiped clean. If the story had focussed more on \"Kay\" and his attempts at re-integrating into the MIB agency, I think this might have been a very funny movie. But \"Kay\\'s\" re-integration just seems to happen far too easily, and for the most part the focus of the movie is on Smith\\'s \"Jay.\" The problem with that is that I just feel Jones is better suited to the whole MIB persona, and I felt Smith quickly became tiresome without Jones balancing him more fully. (And Frank the dog - another of Jay\\'s \"partners\" - just didn\\'t cut it. I really wanted that dog to get eaten by the big worm or something. A very irritating character, in my opinion.)My advice: stick with the original.3/10\"', '\"its the best movie in the whole world.i think there is no car movie out as of now that is better than the fast and the furious. i would recommend everyone see this movie no matter what age or genre of movies they like.although this is specifically my own opinion.\"', '\"Like you know by now, the new SHAFT is not a remake, but a SEQUEL of sorts.SAMUEL L. JACKSON proves he can carry a movie, kick booty and take names, and even get girls...and look cool while he is doing it.I found the cast to be rock solid-except maybe for VANESSA WILLIAMS, who has a weak role, though, I appreciate the LACK of sexual tension between her and JACKSON. It would have been all too clichÃ©-and the script and story are quite decent as well. BUSTA RHYMES is hilarious and CHRISTIAN BALE and the actor who played PEOPLES,Mr WRIGHT, were excellent villains.And as for SHAFT \"JR\"... SL JACKSON is not RICHARD ROUNDTREE, just as ROGER MOORE and PIERCE BROSNAN are not SEAN CONNERY. That does not make their portrayals worthless. SLJ\\'s SHAFT has the same sense of justice and right and wrong as the original SHAFT. Maybe not as suave, and not as jaded...But definitely a bad mofo.Solid summer entertainment, that pays homage to its source material.(Unlike MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE)\"', '\"The Fast And The Furious Is A Action Thriller That Just Keeps On Coming.

Now See The Fast And The Furious In The Theater Or If Is Not In The Theater Then See When Comes To Video. This Movie Is A Action Gem Enjoy.   ****\"', '\"When \"Die Another Day\" hit theatres back in 2002, most of the critics loathed this film, with most of the complaints targeting everything from the \"weak\" and \"unbelievable\" story plot to the \"overuse of CGI\" and yes, even Madonna\\'s \"unnecessary\" cameo. Bond\\'s invisible Aston Martin was also criticized. Well, to all of the hateful critics of this film out there, I\\'m here to tell you that I beg to differ.This film had everything that I ever would have imagined in a Bond film. The women (a very young Rosamund Pike and, especially Halle Berry, were excellent choices), intimate scenes with said women, Q (this time, played by Monty Python\\'s John Cleese), the gadgets, M (played by the always outstanding Judi Dench), plenty of action, exotic cars and locations, and quirky lines, which were mostly delivered from the suave and sophisticated Brosnan. This film also successfully counterbalanced serious and more comical situations perfectly. To go from a surprising waterboarding torture scene that Bond faces after his cover is blown in North Korea to Bond mimicking Gustav Graves during a sword fight later in the film is astonishing and classic Bond. Did the producers go a little overboard on the CGI? Yes, but I was able to look past that. The addition of Michael Madsen as Falco was also another unexpected, but nice touch, considering he played the role of Jinx\\'s boss perfectly. We later find out that Jinx is working with the U.S. government, and later teams up with Bond to bring down Graves (a.k.a. Colonel Moon after his gene therapy) and his accomplices.I once heard that the producers gave Brosnan the Vanquish shortly after filming wrapped up. What a sweet ride that would be to drive around. Something tells me that he might still have that car to this day. Unlike other critics, I thought that the cloaking feature of the Vanquish tied in well with the film, as in my opinion, it showed advances in technology and brought something different to the table. This unique feature also saved Bond\\'s behind on more than one occasion throughout the film. Besides the epic sword fights, one of my favorite scenes in the film will always be the Bond/Zao car chase on ice. It\\'s just something about two expensive and heavily modified cars chasing each other, especially on ice, that really grabs my attention.In summary, although this was a great way for Brosnan to end his run as James Bond, it\\'s really too bad that this was his last outing, as he would\\'ve been great in Casino Royale. Despite having some negative feelings about the franchise after being let go (who wouldn\\'t after being put in such a situation), you can now tell that he misses the role. If you don\\'t believe me, watch \"The November Man\" which gives off certain \"Bond-isms\" in its own way.\"', '\"honestly, i first went to see this movie for the all-star cast. but after seeing it, i was delighted at how cool, hilarious, and enjoyable this movie is.the funniest part however is the poker scene with all-tv-star cast, and Rusty keep referring to them with their real names (Josh, Holly, etc).can\\'t wait for the dvd..\"', '\"A decent flick, that lacked in the intelligence department.  Rather disappointing in that regard, an upgraded script could have helped this movie tremendously.Ben Affleck is Ben Affleck.  What you\\'ve gotten in the past is what you get here.  Whether that is good or bad, is for you to decide.Rating: 6.3/10\"', '\"Good movie, just not as good as the 1st one. If you liked the 1st one you can\\'t miss our on watching this one.\"', '\"Warning, contains numerous spoilersI didn\\'t go in with high expectations of this, being made eight years after the original and originally unplanned for sure (these factors are often signs that a sequel will stink, I didn\\'t see the Carrie sequel but all the reviews told me everything I needed to know). I really only went to see this because friends got me to. What made the original good was lacking in this effort, in terms of originality, characters, plot, length, and in terms of good or bad taste.While the original was just another mismatched pair of cops it didn\\'t have all that tacky street talk, while there was some it wasn\\'t to the annoying extent that it was in say Shaft or Training Day. There was genuine humour and the action was in healthy doses. The length was good at 114 minutes (just under two hours). And there was somewhat a degree of originality with the setting (a change from New York or Los Angeles) and even the villains where not your cliched Hispanic or Homie gangs.This however loses everything. The characters are just plain unlikeable, with Martin Lawrence continually trying to dominate his sister, and then getting angry at Smith\\'s character for dating her, and then taking his overprotection home and tormenting his daughter\\'s date, I didn\\'t really find that funny. I wanted to smash his characters face in for his attempted dominance (and for the record I am not a downtrodden sibling, I just found his antics so annoying). Will Smiths character has none of the attributes in the last one, he\\'s quick to anger, and has a bad attitude as displayed when he referred to a corpse as a bimbo (which means promiscuous), when for all he knew she could have been an Honours student.The treatment of corpses in this is in bad taste. The scene in the morgue (which is where Smith insults the corpse) was disgusting, with organs and brains being shown. This made me feel bad in the toes. Sure there was blood and gore in movies such as Saving Private Ryan and From Hell but that\\'s because, SVP and movies like it used gore to show how horrible wars are, and From Hell dealt with themes of the body and medical procedures.\\nIn the original, when Lowrey and Burnette (the main characters) had a spat (often faked) it was quick, and amusing. In this the spats are long, drawn out, deliberate, and just laced with spite mostly on the part of Lawrences character. I felt particularly uncomfortable watching the scene when they were walking through the fences. This is an action-comedy, spite between chararcters is edging into drama territory. Lets keep action comedy, action comedy. The originality is lacking too. In the original, rather than the usual Hispanics, Rastafarians or homies, the villains were locals led by a European. In this the main villian is a Hispanic, and has dealings with the Russian mafia, very cliched these days.The last half hour is the worst, it is where the movie bcomes too long, just plain ridiculous, and the cliches continue. When Delta Force and that anti-Castro militia came in I thought \"You are joking\" unfortunately they weren\\'t. Bringing the other two groups in and the fact that Joe Pantoliano\\'s character knew someone from one of them was ludicrous. When Burnetts sister is kidnapped by the token hispanic drug dealer, she\\'s taken to Cuba; Castro is involved in the drug trade and gives protection to drug lords, the token Latin American dictator. This is veering into Swachzenegger, Van Damme, and Segal territory. In the original the characters did not come out of the final fight scene unscathed, the characters were pinned down and only freed thanks to Tea Leoni, Burnett took a bullet to the leg, Lowrey took a hefty punch in the face and was thrown from a moving car and couldn\\'t get up without help, and Ruiz and Sanchez would have been killed if not for the intervention of Lowrey. In this the characters with their militray and para-military allies get through without any trouble, only one member gets a bullet in the shoulder and even some members of the Cuban army are popped off. If they do Bad Boys 3 will they go to the Middle East and fight Saddam Hussein loyalists? How Will Smith could oppose the war in Iraq (for which I will always like him for) and yet star in such cliched material, I will never know.Then there is the chase through the shanty town which is a complete rip off from the Jackie Chan movie Police Story. Joe Pantoliano played the cliched role of the stressed out superior officer in the original with such genuine humour I didn\\'t mind. In this he tried far too hard in this to pul it off, it seemed too forced. There was nothing to save this movie. There was the freeway chase scene, but thats hardly a redeeming factor. Smith takes up acting in cliched material ending his record of descent movies (that I\\'ve seen at least), while Lawrence continues his record of lousy movies, except for the original Bad Boys which is great and Blue Streak which is quite amusing. But otherwise, is pretty bad.Big lack of originality, Bad taste, Bad characters, Bad movie. Avoid it if you can...like the plague\"', '\"I was twelve when I first saw this in theaters. I absolutely loved it, bought the VHS (and later the DVD), and watched it repeatedly with my friends. It was quotable and inspirational to me at the time, for it sparked my interest in martial arts. After having not seen the movie in at least ten to fifteen years, it popped up on Netflix. I decided to watch it again to see if it\\'s one of those movies that loses its appeal as one ages. I found I still love it.Charlie\\'s Angels won\\'t win any awards, but if you love dumb fun movies that dip their toes into ridiculous territory, you can\\'t find much better than this. The awesome soundtrack remains awesome, featuring such nostalgic bands as the Prodigy, Blink 182, and Heart. It does manage to slip up here with a song by Destiny\\'s Child, but its time is mercifully cut short and shoved toward the end. The story is threadbare; as a child, I didn\\'t pay much attention to it. As an adult, I did, and it does the job. There\\'s a point A and a point B, and the journey between them is the focus here, showcasing the angels Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore), and Alex (Lucy Liu) completing various intelligence tasks utilizing flashy costumes and eye-rollingly ridiculous or goofy techniques. There\\'s wonderful use of various locales in the movie as it goes from set to set (a fort near the ocean, a racetrack, the beach, a movie set, an airplane). Some scenes utilizing green screen didn\\'t age too well, but they aren\\'t embarrassing. I learned my love of the beautifully awkward Crispin Glover here; as the silent and aptly named Creepy Thin Man, he is nothing but intriguing and unique as a minor villain (who comes back for the sequel). Sam Rockwell is also interesting in his own right, and Bill Murray puts in a chuckle-worthy performance as Bosley.As for the angels, growing up I idolized Dylan for her rebellious and punkish ways, and she has arguably the best scene in the movie (involving taking out a room full of guys while tied to a chair with her arms behind her back). Barrymore clearly had a ton of fun in the role. Diaz has a blast playing the goofy Natalie, who not only shines during many of the fight scenes but also manages to bring life to the movie with her ceaseless energy. The only angel of the bunch who wasn\\'t distinguished enough is Liu as Alex. Alex completes a few tech tasks throughout the film and has one memorable scene to the song Barracuda (which also features a brief before-she-was-famous cameo by Melissa McCarthy), but the other two angels are just SO unique and fun that she pales in comparison.Another review related Charlie\\'s Angels to a long music video, and that comparison is fair. The movie is so focused on being cool, flashy, and syncing up slow-mo action scenes to fantastic music that it doesn\\'t hit the points of everything that makes a movie a true \"film\" because it doesn\\'t try to reach them. The director is the under-named McG, who is responsible for directing/producing some of the most memorable music videos of the \\'90s (The Offspring\\'s \"Pretty Fly for a White Guy\" and Smash Mouth\\'s \"All Star\" to name a few, the latter of which was his last credit before this). Like those music videos, Charlie\\'s Angels is full of color and hints of goofiness. This movie has tons of flaws that film critics could pick apart, but as a piece of solid entertainment, it never bores. Full of personality, great music, and memorable set pieces and costumes, this movie may not always be cohesive, but it\\'s a heckuva lot of fun.For entertainment value alone I\\'d give this a 10; as a joyless critic I\\'d give it a 6. My final score ends up just in the middle at an 8. This won\\'t be my last time re-watching this movie; there\\'s just too much to love.\"', '\"I am amazed that this movie has managed to pull a 6.2 on the IMDB average! What a piece of garbage.  Horrible acting, stupid gen-x extreme sports nonsense, and a bunch of fast but hideous cars make this a real stinker.  If you want a car movie, at least have one where the cars look halfway decent, as opposed to a bunch of tacky colors and splash graphics.  It was about like watching the demo at the front of a poor racing video game.\"', '\"Bad Boys II is an absolutely brilliant cop comedy starring Will Smith, Martin Lawrence and Gabrielle Union. This sequel to the first Bad Boys film is much more better than the first Bad Boys film. This film is a high powered action thriller with awesome action, comedy, awesome car chases and loads more. The Car chases in this film where Dt Mike Lowrey (played by Will Smith) is driving the Ferrari 550 Marenello chasing after some malicious criminals is awesome. That scene was an endurance filled high powered car chase and the car that Mike Lowrey used, the Ferrari 550 Maranello was and is an absolutely brilliant car. Dt Mike Lowrey is a tough cop who is not to be messed with and Dt Marcus Burnett (played by Martin Lawrence) is also a tough cop, but sometimes annoys Mike Lowrey because Marcus talks too much and doesn\\'t do things the right way. Bad Boys was and is a very good film but Bad Boys II is much more better and Bad Boys II is a film filled with high powered tension, action, violence and comedy. Will Smiths performance as Dt Mike Lowrey is absolutely brilliant and he was awesome in the film. Martin Lawrences acting as Dt Marcus Burnett was also brilliant. Gabrielle Unions acting as Syd was brilliant and Jordi Mollas performance as villain Johnny Tapia was also brilliant. Yes this film kicks arse against Bad Boys and is a film which I loved watching and found enjoyable to watch.\"', '\"There aren\\'t many movies over the last dozen years to have a bigger impact on society than this one. The Fast and the Furious glorified street racing and made the Honda Civic and the other cars featured in the film must buys for teenage boys across America. The reason is pretty obvious, the movie is outstanding. The cast of Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and others is outstanding and the story is really interesting and unique. The plot and characters are all really well developed, creating an immersive viewing experience not often seen in movies under two hours. The cars and race scenes are fantastic and the action has you sitting on the edge of your seat. The only negative for me was some of the cinematic effects. The director tried to get cute and a lot of those effects actually hurt the scenes, not helped. Nonetheless, those few sequences aren\\'t enough to ruin the film and the entertainment value for the movie is still sky high.\"', '\"Ben Affleck has a go at playing Jack Ryan, the Tom Clancy hero, in \"The Sum of All Fears,\" a 2003 film also starring Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Liev Schreiber, Alan Bates, and Bridget Moynihan. I\\'ll admit I\\'m not familiar with the books, but it does seem that either the screenwriter or Clancy made this an earlier story - by Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, Jack, Harrison Ford in those films, is married to Cathy; here, they\\'re just dating. Also, Affleck is younger than Ford. That\\'s odd, because this film seems to be cashing in on 9/11, so it should really be after the other films...so I\\'m confused.That\\'s what I mean about this movie - I enjoyed it, but it\\'s one of those things that, if you think about it, makes very little sense. Here, some sort of Nazi splinter group has purchased an old bomb and is making the Russians think that the U.S. has attacked them and vice versa. Amidst the chaos of a huge atomic explosion that wipes out a stadium, it\\'s up to Jack to reach someone in power before they push the red button and each country wipes out the other, leaving the world free for - who, Germany? - to take over. Not that there will be much left.There\\'s a lot of action, and the movie goes fast enough so that you don\\'t notice the holes right away.Affleck is likable, but you\\'ll have a hard time lining him up with the Jack Ryan of Ford. Alec Baldwin has also played Jack; that\\'s maybe a closer comparison. James Cromwell is terrific as a no-nonsense President; Morgan Freeman underplays and is very good.People that have read the book hate this movie, so if you\\'ve read the book, I wouldn\\'t bother seeing this.\"', '\"This is the biggest cast ensemble up until The Avengers when Brad Pitt and George Clooney were Hollywood\\'s top guys. The film is subtly humorous, making for big laughs. This movie is why people made movies in the first - it is pure entertainment from start to finish with every actor getting their chance to shine. If you\\'re looking for a entertaining film, look no further than Ocean\\'s Eleven because it features everything great about cinema. You\\'ll appreciate it even more on multiple viewings.\"', '\"\"Shanghai Noon\" has Owen Wilson.  That alone makes it worth seeing.\\nAt times, however, it\\'s an awkward juxtaposition of genres that probably weren\\'t meant to go together.  This is most apparent in the first thirty minutes.  For one thing, it could have used a little more development regarding Princess Pei Pei\\'s motivation for fleeing her country.  It\\'s kind of hard to care terribly much about a Princess who abandons her position, country, and family just for a lark.  It\\'s not as if she\\'s just taking the night off (\"Roman Holiday\").  She\\'s gone and she isn\\'t coming back.  I guess we\\'re just supposed to cheer her for heroic individuality.\\nHowever, once Owen and Jackie are official partners, things pick up and don\\'t let up.  Unlike most comedies, this one doesn\\'t poop out.  Most comedies end with an almost entirely laughless twenty minutes as the plot or the message or both are given perfunctory notice (Tommy Boy, Strange Brew, etc.)  That\\'s where \"Shanghai Noon\" has the action/adventure/western thing going for it. Stretching the genre quite a bit, it\\'s fun and funny and even a little sweet.  That shouldn\\'t be a surprise since it stars Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan (two terribly endearing guys).  Owen gives us more of his `outlaw with a heart\\' schtick (ala `Bottle Rocket\\').  His quirky, sensitive, introspective, garrulous cowboy is a delight to see and hear (especially in the middle of the movie when he and Jackie are imprisoned and when he\\'s showing Jackie the ropes of being a cowboy).      Jackie gives us more of his \"butt-kicker with a heart\" (owing more to Chaplin than Lee) as usual.  He fights the baddies with just about everything imaginable: a horse-shoe tied to a rope, elk horns, his ponytail, baby pines, a revolving mirror, a giant bell, a basket, and even a sheriff\\'s badge (used as a Ninja star).  At one point Owen says to Jackie, \"Â…when I look at you there\\'s something different about you and I can see it.  I can see it in your eyes.\"  This is true of both these characters and these actors.Finally, (to its detriment) this flick takes deus-ex-machina to a new level. It seems the action can\\'t progress for fifteen minutes with some outside, unexpected rescue (and it\\'s always just in the nick of time).  The prison break is thanks to Jackie\\'s unwanted Indian bride (who we haven\\'t seen for the last fifteen minutes).  She also rescues them from being hanged. Finally, she and her whole tribe show up at the end of the movie to save the day.  And when Jackie isn\\'t being rescued by his bride, he is busy rescuing Owen (from two different duels).  All in all, however, \"Shanghai Noon\" accomplishes what it sets out to do. It makes you laugh and even warms your heart a little (like a good shot a rye).\"', '\"This rubbish should be given a paper medal for going way, way above and beyond the call of stupidity. I never watched the original series on TV and after viewing this drivel I feel fortunate indeed. What was the point of filming this piffle which could have been titled \"Charlie\\'s Airheads\"? I figure it was made to sell to little teeny bopper girls who have bought into the \"women really are strong and bad\" myth. And these ladies were \"bad\": but sometimes bad is bad. My fave scene was when one of the airheads, sorry, Angels, fell several stories from a building, rolled several hundred feet down a mountain - naked, no less -and made a phone call. All with no scratches. Avoid.\"', '\"The issue being in main,Michael Bay!\\nHe is one of the worst directors on the planet,and would probably be close enough to give Uwe Boll a run for the NUMBER 1 SPOT.\\nHe is a useless clown!\\nThe movie itself was a flop!\\nBad script,writing,directing,acting...the list goes on.\\nThis is what you get,from a Michael Bay movie!\\nThe guy has too much EGO...thinks he\\'s a brilliant director,blah,blah,blah....I know the truth though.\"', '\"Why did this become a box office smash?  It has action, it has fast cars and it has no intellectual value whatsoever.  Not to mention, it has Paul Walker and Vin Diesel--who will appeal to the female audience.  OK, so it has the potential to be a slam-bang, entertaining action flick...but I wasn\\'t entertained.  Many will be blown away by the stunts.  But I found them to be far from spectacular.  The movie does keep a fast-pace--almost in the style of an MTV music video--but it can\\'t seem to escape from dullness.  Director Rob Cohen, who has actually directed some good movies in the past, tries too hard to be flashy.  The soundtrack, though full of great songs, is out of whack.  The songs seemed to have been chosen at random.  And of course Cohen felt this is going to appeal to a predominantly young audience, so he jumped at any attempt to insert a song from Ja Rule or any other popular rap artist into each scene, whether it\\'s appropriate or not.As for our two leads, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker--ever consider acting lessons?  The two of them are stiff as a board.  In one scene, Diesel is telling a story about his father\\'s death and he doesn\\'t let out the slightest hint of emotion.  Walker\\'s got the looks, Diesel\\'s got the bod.  I guess that\\'s all they need to qualify!  Standards are getting lower and lower by the minute, in the world of cinema.  Michelle Rodriguez unfortunately has a very small role.  Too bad, because she seems like she has real potential.  I haven\\'t even seen her debut role--which everyone was raving about--in \"Girlfight,\" but she has great ability and a strong presence, and I\\'m sure she can rise to the top if given the right outlet. BTW, she\\'s also from Jersey City.  Representin\\'!!!!  The dialogue is downright awful.  The characters are flat.  The plot is far from compelling and sometimes predictable, with tired action cliches planted here and there.  How many movies are we gonna see where the hero ends up falling in love with the villain\\'s sister?And I think the movie would\\'ve worked better if it took itself less seriously.  \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" was no gem either, but it was campy and it was meant to be campy.  And it was done with a tongue-in-cheek approach, with some very funny moments of comic relief.  \"The Fast and the Furious\" actually tries to be A-class entertainment, but it doesn\\'t even deserve to be in the D-class.  There are some nice shots of scantily clad babes, and that\\'s the only reason why I\\'m not giving this movie a rating of 1.  If you\\'re an automobile fanatic or is this is simply your kind of entertainment, have fun.  If not...be prepared for the Dull and the Boring.  My score:  3 (out of 10)\"', '\"I had been anticipating the 20th Bond film for ages, after the disappointment of \"The World Is Not Enough\", I hoped that the next installment could restore some of the class that it once epitomised. However that never happened, and all we have is a movie that although watchable, is just as easily forgettable.Pierce Brosnan returns as James Bond/007, but rather than the usual unrelated beginning to what the movie is actually about, we see Bond actually getting the crap beaten out of him. I was impressed by that because we needed to see some of the gritty side to being a spy. However I didn\\'t feel that the rest of the story really showed anything that Ian Fleming created in his character of James Bond. I honestly believe that \"License to Kill\" showed the true side which is ruthless and passionate.The story revolves around the mysterious Gustav Graves, who went from rags to riches in an instant. Zao, his side kick, has nasty scars glazed with shiny diamonds, together with Graves make a perfect pair of villains out to humiliate the western world and show true domination in the worst possible way. Toby Stephens and Rick Yune do a fantastic job, showing no mercy to anyone who tries to undermine them.Then comes the Bond girls-Halle Berry plays NSA Agent Jinx who enters in a supposed homage to Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress, the original Bond chick) however ends up looking retarded as opposed to sexy. Despite awakening Bond\\'s sex drive, she\\'s basically off doing her own thing and when finally questioned by Bond as to what it is that she\\'s doing, all she says is \"Same as you\"...that sums up her character development. I thought her use of \"Your mama\" and \"Bitch\" was ridiculous, it made a mockery of the classy comebacks that have been in previous films, umm I don\\'t think any of the ghetto was in the movie! I think Jinx was hyped up only because Halle Berry had won an oscar, a spin off movie just wouldn\\'t work, Jinx is just like every other Bond girl...who disappears into nothing. That golden statue is a curse if you ask me!Rosamund Pike plays M16 agent Miranda Frost, who may I add doesn\\'t seem interested in anyway in Bond at all. Her icy exterior makes her all the more interesting, however her obvious role as the villain Bond girl reduces any element of surprise in the character. Miranda isn\\'t in the movie much, as the limelight primarily is on Jinx (unfortunately)also there is a lack of character development. Miranda does come up with some good lines and does get some action scenes herself. She should have been the romantic interest in the end.In the world of special effects, what the hell happened to this movie?? For starters, the first surfing scene was amazing as it was actually real but when Bond later goes for another surf, it is so damn obvious he\\'s surfing a blue screen! When Bond\\'s hovercraft topples over the edge of an ice cliff, we all can obviously see the toy hovercraft used to slam against the wall!Invisible cars?? Ok Bond relishes in fantasy and who doesn\\'t love it?! But an invisible car? That\\'s when you know Bond is starting to go in the no-go zone, and once you start asking Madonna to sing the Bond theme and making a forgettable cameo appearance that\\'s when you the know the producers are getting desperate! Bring back Shirley Bassey or Lulu or introduce some new faces, anything but electronic-Cher sounding music.I think the next Bond movie should be the last in the series, as nobody else can take over Brosnan. The plot lines are getting more far fetched and the special effects are just getting worse (please we don\\'t need another movie showing \"great\" explosions like \"Diamonds Are Forever\". Let Moneypenny have Bond, let S.P.E.C.T.R.E come back for one last thrill (please read this Kevin McClory), let it end in class!\"', '\"omg! this is my new fav movie! this movie is AWESOME!!! some parts are hard to believe but entertaining.  its the ultimate action/suspense movie! keeping you on the edge of your seat every second! definitely worth every cent to see it! luv it! i like it better than the first too!\"', '\"The Fast And The Furious Is A Fun Action Car Movie Staring Paul Walker As Brian O\\'Conner Vin Diesel As Dom A Fun Ride\"', '\"Just when you thought that perhaps the movie wouldn\\'t continue down it\\'s inexorably predictable path anymore: It does. Suspense and surprise are thrown away in this movie. It also really doesn\\'t have a really good race until the very end of the move, by which time you are merely waiting for the movie to finish in the unbelievably \\'made to a Hollywood checklist\\' way that it does.\"', '\"Great movie. funny and entertaining. Nice story. funny talking lol (about 5 viewings)\"', '\"If I had a set of fancy cars, bad actors, and a camera, I can redo this movie in a matter of days.  It\\'s sad to think that in America most people have seen this movie, but not greats like Taras Bulba and The King and I. Put Yul Brynner in a fancy car for today\\'s audiences, and it would be a hit. Of course, he would spit on himself for doing it. He\\'s probably spinning in his grave right now.  I don\\'t blame him.\"', '\"Awful film.Terrible visual effects, dire writing. What was the director actually doing for the year it took to make this film? The script sounded improvised. Pierce Brosnan\\'s so called \\'acting\\' was much to be desired. Since when was James Bond a seedy old man chatting up women, dressed in a 60 year old\\'s wardrobe? The visual effects were so terrible, it might as well have been animated in stop motion. Replacing landscapes, equipment, people with CGI.Overall - just don\\'t bother watching. I would have given this no stars if the vote counter would have let me.\"', '\"This movie should really rock--John Singleton juicing up the classic \\'70s Shaft vibe with Samuel Jackson set in modern day New York. Throw in Christian Bale and quite a few cameos from the original Shaft, Richard Roundtree, and how could you have anything other than a winner? Sorry to say, the only \\'70s vibe this movie captures is that of an utterly mediocre \\'70s made-for-TV movie. Unfortunately, being set in modern day New York, you don\\'t even get the nostalgia of \\'70s cars and stuff. This movie is just a total disappointment. I was watching this misfire with other people and kept hoping in vain that it would get better as it went along, but if I were alone I would have stopped this ordeal midstream. (I should be honest and note that the two other viewers who had no prior knowledge of Blaxploitation films, Shaft and Richard Roundtree, etc., and thus had no hopes, expectations, or preconceived biases considered it passable entertainment.) My take is, ask yourself if you want to watch a totally run-of-the-mill vintage made-for-TV action movie, basically just updated by adding a whole lot of swearing (although I doubt this bothers too many people nowadays, and I could personally care less)--I really, really don\\'t. I would much rather watch old Columbo or Rockford episodes. When I think how well Quentin Tarantino did with Jackie Brown, a similar project, this movie just looks lame, lame, lame.\"', '\"I have a soft spot for this film, I don\\'t think it\\'s well made and I don\\'t think the plot is any good. In reality it\\'s just like every other Miami based modern cop film. It involves drugs, Cubans and all the other clichÃ©s but at the end of the day what actually makes this film is the wonderful and hilarious partnership between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Their chemistry makes the film worth watching. It\\'s like they\\'re only playing it for fun which makes it even more enjoyable because you can just relax and watch just for fun.I regret I haven\\'t seen the first film but I know that this one is a great film to watch to relax, you don\\'t have to think and you can just have fun. Yes it\\'s explicit, but I\\'ve seen more serious films with more swearing and random sex scenes.\"', '\"There are two reviews here:For the women: Prepare to drool. This is raw sexiness at its best. From Clooney to Reiner, there is something for all ages. The movie moves at a fast, engaging pace (though my back did inform me of it being 15 min too long), and keeps one guessing, as to when the perfect crime will go wrong, and the perfect men made to look ridiculous. The plot is not unique. Only the charm and class are. The casinos of Las Vegas look fresh, inviting and full of energy, and Andy Garcia seems to be the perfect owner.For the men: Wish, that it was this easy to be the one drooled at, and drool yourself. Sorry, but Julia Roberts just does not match up to the rest.Of all heist movies, this kept my attention longest, and for no other reason other than the raw star power. My recommendations, if for no other reason than to see how cool these guys can look.\"', '\"This film is an insult to moviegoers.  It wastes your time, money, and brain cells on some cheap laughs and a severely unentertaining plot.I, personally, am a big fan of Men in Black.  Which is, of course, the reason I went to see the second.  My rating is based upon these opinions: [1] The acting was as best that could be done with a script like that. [2] The story was long, blasÃ©, and felt programmed. [3] The characters, new and old, were as full of stuffing as Laura Flynn Boyle\\'s brassiere.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones\\' agents should receive a good tongue-lashing for letting them act in this \"movie\".  I am sure that if Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones had read the script before signing on, they would have not participated in this joke of a sequel.  They probably thought that since MIB was such a success, surely the writers would come up with a great sequel and make them more money!  Jodie Foster had good intuition when ducking out Hannibal, the so-so follow-up to Silence of the Lambs; too bad these actors didn\\'t do the same with their sequel.Needless to say, I was more than disappointed.  This distasteful fad of constant sequels and prequels going around in Hollywood is obnoxious and unnecessary.  They are outnumbering and overpowering the originals popping up occasionally, which are doomed to be played down by the press.  These excuses for motion pictures are getting increasingly abundant, and are injuring our vision between good movie and bad movie.  I just hope that award shows\\' sight is a bit clearer.My rating: 2 out of 10  (Not a one only because of the determined acting and very few chuckles it got out of me.)\"', '\"Anyone who watches movies like this and expects fully realistic stunts and a bulletproof plot is a quite frankly an idiot. If you want to give this movie 1 star , where the hell does Arnie\\'s \"Commando\" come on the ratings of \"laws of realism do not apply\" films and as for any of the Bond films when it comes to a realistic plot... well. Personally, this film is an exciting action movie with plenty of visually awesome stunts, quality soundtrack and a couple of nice surprises. Where this film does loose points with me though, is the cheesy slow mo scenes and lines. It really does badly interrupt an otherwise great action movie, which you should see. 8/10\"', '\"Die Another Day is the twentieth official Bond movie (not included are two versions of Casino Royale and Never Say Never Again), and as such represents something of a milestone in the ageing superspy\\'s life. The producers therefore had quite a lot of expectation to live up to, and luckily Die Another Day for the most part delivers the goods.Pierce Brosnan appears very much at ease with his Bond persona as he goes from action scene to action scene, deftly picking of villains and dropping some natty one-liners along the way.The plot hearkens back to the darker, slightly meaner Bond of Fleming\\'s original novels as he sets off on a personal vendetta against the wishes of M (in many ways reminiscent of License to Kill), but before too long he\\'s back to his old self again, under the caring arm of M and Q. Q\\'s gadgets get more and more sophisticated with each film, so it will come as no suprise to learn that Bond\\'s main asset this time is an invisible car, fitted with machine guns and missiles of course.The storyline, revolving around dealings with North Korea and double-agents, is no more challenging than any other Bond, and presents you with everything you\\'ve come to expect - exotic locales, beautiful women and physically disfigured villains with an unhealthy interest in world domination. Brosnan tackles them all with equal aplomb and emerges from each encounter more or less unruffled. My only real gripe with this film, and the movie world in general, is the increasing reliance on CGI, which in this film looks very dodgy indeed. I would rather see stunt-men risk their lives for our entertainment than see a CGI Bond that looks like something from Super Mario Brothers any day. Of course when CGI is good you can\\'t tell the difference, but when it\\'s rushed or done on a low budget, which appears to be the problem here, it just lets the whole movie down. Rants aside, this is an enjoyable, entertaining movie, and for Bond trivia buffs there are a cornucopia of references to previous movies to keep you glued to the screen. What more could you ask for?\"', '\"The Fast and the Furious is one movie I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to see. And yet I have to be fair. When it first came out I took one look at it, and said \\'No way Jose. That\\'s one movie I just know I\\'ll hate.\\' A few years later we rented it, and horror of horrors I enjoyed it. As a 16 year old girl (which I was at the time) it certainly does not fit my profile of film watching (I watch Japanese movies/ horror/ war films) in any respect, and yet I found myself actually caring about the characters however slick and bland they were. And no I don\\'t fancy Paul Walker or Vin Diesel.Though it has a formulaic plot- cop infiltrates street racers, and learns its about friendship and respect, it made up for this with it\\'s admittedly excellent chemistry between the stars, and the rather cool race scenes.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker turned in reasonable performances as the cop and gang leader, and Michelle Rodriguez was surprisingly watchable as Dominic Torreto\\'s girlfriend.However what made the film for me personally was the element of pure good fun going on between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. They weren\\'t taking it seriously, there was no heavy philosophy, and if you plan to watch this movie you should just follow their lead, and take it as a mindless action movie with a good dose of fun.\"', '\"The opening credits sequence is excellent: Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) climbs a mountain with his bare hands; once he reaches the peak, a chopper shows up, shooting a missile on the ground. This missile contain a pair of sunglasses, thanks to which Hunt receives instructions concerning his new assignment, followed by the famous line \"This message will self-destruct in five seconds\". He then tosses the glasses away, their explosion forming the movie\\'s title. That scene, alongside the spectacular motorbike chase, is M:I:II\\'s highlight. Otherwise it\\'s just an ordinary, predictable and pretty stupid action flick.This time, Hunt and his partner, Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) have to stop their former colleague Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from infecting the world with a deadly virus known as \"Chimera\". In order to succeed, they need help from Nayah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), Ambrose\\'s ex, who\\'s now dating Ethan. You can easily guess the rest...Like his predecessor, Brian De Palma, action guru John Woo favors style over substance. But De Palma had a good script to work on. Woo, on the other hand, hopes the audience won\\'t notice the narrative flaws, so that he can offer us his visual trademarks (slow motion, doves etc.). Unfortunately for him, we do notice the flaws: for one thing, the love story is quite insipid, and it\\'s also given too much room (no prize for guessing how the film ends: it\\'s SO obvious!). In addition, the characters stink: Nayah is still passable, but new sidekick Billy Baird (John Polson) was completely unnecessary. Why not just leave Luther alone? And Ambrose is a crappy villain: in Scott\\'s hands, he looks like a stereotyped caricature of a respectable bad guy. Still, Cruise and Rhames make a great spy couple, and Anthony Hopkins\\'uncredited cameo as Hunt\\'s supervisor is very enjoyable, particularly his infamous remark: \"Mr. Hunt, this isn\\'t mission:difficult, this is mission:impossible. \"Difficult\" should be a walk in the park for you.\" Pity the same can\\'t be said of this film\\'s director.\"', '\"Ocean\\'s Eleven is one of the best heist film that I have ever seen. It\\'s thoroughly fun and entertaining. The cast was fantastic as well, and they really made this movie so much more enjoyable. I thought the movie did an impressive job in captivating the audience. And, (without giving away any spoilers) I really liked the ending of movie. Overall, a brilliant heist film that I look forward to rewatch.\"', '\"The second installment of the Bad Boys which are once again on the move in an attempt to arrest the leader of a notorious drug cartel from Cuba. With one of the boys\\' sister undercover in the operation, they must act quick until she gets into more trouble than she already is.This movie follows the same footsteps as the first one, only with even more flamboyance, explosions and action. It also makes you laugh out loud multiple times but not at its predecessor\\'s level, while compensating through intense action. The same two great actors do a very good job in creating this picture and the whole entertainment part which is simply one of a kind. A very good comedy from every aspect and a very good movie overall.\"', '\"I would regard this as the best Bond film to date (closely followed by Goldeneye).  From the assortment of poor ratings that I have heard, it seems that this film has been unfortunately underrated.  The only people, it seems, that dislike the film are the relics from the days of Dr. No who are bitter over the slightest change in 007\\'s style.  This film shows a side of James Bond never seen before and gives the character a more human persona. This is the Bond for the 21st Century.  Let\\'s face it times change.\"', '\"Sunday nite 12:30 am  Very tired from hard weekend. Just had to ditto a user\\'s remarks. Dead on. Only pleasure I had in a crud weekend. Chase scene more than simple \"cars\\' involved. Best chase since Bullett or The Getaway. Do it when get chance - on cable only. Bcast and commercials will destroy it. Even Van Damme\\'s Cyborg better on full cable. Many parts in it cut from the bcast ver.end of me - below user commentSome of the stunts in this movie are incredible, and the 1st big car chase is something that will have any action fan falling off their mosquito infested cinema seat - forget the Matrix Reloaded - this is the greatest car chase ever captured on film.The script is patchy, making way for more improvised gags rather that creating a deep story, but in a film like this, deep plot just isn\\'t what fans want. Joe Pantoliano is again a highlight as the Captain, and has to be considered one of the best police captains since that old guy from the police academy movies...All in all, a near-perfect action comedy. Wrongly slated by too many people, but hey, i loved it...\"', '\"This movie was pretty good, all in all. It had a lot of funny jokes. I think it was mostly geared toward younger people. But a few were funny.I don\\'t want to spoil it for anyone, so I\\'m just going to write in general terms.One of gags in this movie was so hilarious, it canceled out all of the bad jokes and somewhat weak storyline, and turned it into a wholly positive experience for me.I\\'m still laughing, 2 weeks later! I am glad I suffered through all of the painful so-called humor, just to see that one scene.Instant classic! I found parts of the actual story difficult to follow. I don\\'t think that\\'s so important, if you can realize this movie for what it is. Harmless fun. 7 out of 10.\"', '\"I think it must have been, because so many parts of it were quite laughable. The numerous fight/chase scenes were shamelessly overdone, the scripting was awful, the plot was nonexistent, and there was more gratuitous use of slow motion than a Jerry Bruckheimer film.  Not only did the movie seem to drag on forever, but it actually managed to get much worse as it progressed. I noticed that the antagonist\\'s Irish accent got much thicker as the movie went on.  And surprisingly, there weren\\'t any nifty gadgets as there should be in a spy movie.  This insult to one\\'s intelligence is definitely down there with Armageddon and Star Wars Episode I as one of the worst movies in recent years and is certainly a contender for this year\\'s Golden Raspberry award.\"', '\"Mission: Impossible 2 (2000): Dir: John Woo / Cast: Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Ving Rhames, Richard Roxburgh: A bigger budget action film with double the stupidity and makes absolutely no sense. It opens on a plane that has just left Sydney Australia. Passengers are gassed out while the villain, played by Dougray Scott makes off with a briefcase that contains a monster virus. It causes a massive cell destruction when injected. Tom Cruise returns and is assigned to track down the virus and anti-virus and return to headquarters. Plagued with stupidity such as Tom Cruise scaling a mountain and defying the laws of gravity. There are dumb sexual situation between Cruise and Thandie Newton that come off as corny. And the whole sudden available lifelike masks render no sense at all. How can he have masks of people he hasn\\'t met? Directed by John Woo who can do action as he proved with the far superior Face Off, but that film had substance where as this one is just pure junk. He could have played smash up derby against a brick wall and made more sense than what he concocts here. Cruise is difficult to accept here because he defies logic too much. Scott plays the standard villain who will go down to a fist fight or possible explosion. Newton plays damsel in one of those flimsy rescue scenes. Ving Rhames returns from the first film. Well made but too pointless, stupid and impossible. Score: 2 / 10\"', '\"There is only one rule when making a successful sequel. That is, that the sequel has has to be head and shoulders above its predecessor to be considered good at all. It has to be fresh. The key to making a good comedy is to make the humor seem effortless enough so that the audience can enjoy it without having to be told what is funny (this is why laugh-tracks on sitcoms are the worst idea ever). The key to creating a good plot is to give it time to develop, and to let the audience enjoy its twists and turns, whether they be good or bad.<Warning: Possible spoilers ahead>Sadly, Men in Black II accomplishes none of these. Aliens come to earth, threaten to destroy it, yada yada yada, MIB has to figure out what\\'s going on before the earth is destroyed, yada yada yada, big guns, alien explodes at the end, just in the nick of time, after being hit by the big guns. Which of the movies am I describing? Both of them. Far from being fresh, this sequel is exactly the same as the original.As for the humor... there was humor? Simply put, this movie had its moments. Unfortunately, they were few and far between, and, in any case, significantly less interesting than the continual clashing of personalities in the first movie. This was due to the simple fact that in MIB II, Agents Jay and Kay acted identically.As for the plot, throughout the film, the characters were supposed to be hunting down clues to the location of the light. Instead of getting the feeling that I was watching the characters unlock a mystery, I get the feeling that I\\'m watching a bratty teenager and his crotchety uncle following a scavenger hunt to... who cares. The film never conveys a sense of importance to the audience about what they are looking for, or why this thing is so important. Not only that, but this wafer thin plot is crumpled into an 88 minute timeframe, leaving, well, a mess.Maybe the problem is that everybody involved was so determined to make a good movie, that every idea from the past five years ended up getting forced into one movie. Or, everybody involved in the movie was so determined to get a big fat payday, that they didn\\'t care about how crappy their movie turned out. There. That one sounds more reasonable.I gave this movie a 3 out of 10. Not the worst movie ever, but definitely not worth my time.\"', '\"This is a crime caper movie with great comedy; it has a fantastic cast. Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Roberts, Mac, Garcia and Cheadle are only a few to mention.Danny Ocean has served his time and plans on doing another job, a job on his wife\\'s new boyfriend and assembles his team to rob the biggest casino in Vagas. The cast are perfect, they provide great performances and make the audience laugh and hold you on the edge when attempting to rob the place.Clooney seems to be playing himself in this movie which is perfectly fine, while Pitt takes on the role of a comedian and delivers.One for the collection.\"', '\"Genuine enjoyable viewing experience.Could have been less lovey dovey scenes with Benjamin.Morgan Freeman was outstanding and good casting featuring doves and hawks trying to bend the Pres\\'s ears.\"', '\"The 20-th Bond is no birthday feast as we usually know them: it is a dark, brooding Bond which lacks most of the wittiness that has become a trademark of the 007-epics. Still there is much to be enjoyed in this high-paced and beautifully designed spectacle.\"', '\"This is a fast paced movie about illegal street racing.  There is an interesting sideline plot involving other illegal activity, but the cars and the acting are the real winners.  Portrayed in style the cars show us the subculture of street racing and a general love for speed.  Vin Desil just shines in this movie... If you haven\\'t developed a love for his acting you will, he hasn\\'t been in much but he has captured notice of even Speilberg. Flics: pitch black (decent sci-fi), broiler room (good illegal trading movie) and few others.  Most of the other acting in the movie is first rate which allows you to stay focused throughout.  Although this movie does not sport a lot of big names this movie may provide us with a few new stars in the years to come.\"', '\"Men In Black II, the follow up to the hit film Men In Black, features Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as the agents K and J respectively. This time around, J finds trouble in the universe as a hostile alien hunts for a mysterious object on Earth, and the only man who can help him doesn\\'t remember a thing Â– that man (of course) is K. So after J restores K\\'s memory with a `de-neuralizer\\', together they hunt down the alien scum.  Men In Black II (advertised as MIIB) isn\\'t half as fun or entertaining as the original 1997 film, and falls short on the jokes almost all the time. One must wonder why the writer(s) couldn\\'t have come up with a better excuse for bringing back K other than the cheap gimmick of, `Hey, let\\'s just have a DE-neuralizer to bring his memory back!\\' I hate when sequels use subjects like that just to bring back a character. `Hey, he\\'s not dead, he was just run over by a tank!\\' Come on, writers, a little bit more credibility, please?   The jokes in MIIB, as I mentioned, almost all fall flat. There were a few giggles from children during the film, but when I was sitting there, I could tell that almost no one liked what they were seeing, including the children. Have you ever been to a film that is so bad, that people try to laugh at the `jokes\\' because they are so embarrassed they paid to see `this stupid film\\'? That\\'s MIIB for you.   The actors in the film seemed to be holding back a little as well, and J\\'s love interest was a really untalented actress. I think she was trying to act like Halle Berry (even the haircut) but I personally wouldn\\'t even want Halle Berry, seeing that I think she isn\\'t a good actress.  I don\\'t agree with other reviewers when they say MIIB is repetitive, recycling the jokes from the original film. I think that even if they had repeated all the same jokes, the audience still would have liked it better than the way it turned out.   Barry Sonnenfeld may be losing his charm as a director. I have not seen Big Trouble yet, but I heard that it is not funny, so maybe that is a clue. And the aliens in this film look like they came from a Jim Henson\\'s R Us store. There is a crazy fight sequence in the middle of the film, and J fights all the creaturesÂ…I think that was the closest I came to laughing Â– the time when the director DIDN\\'T want us to laugh. But, during that sequence, there was a segment where we see an up close and personal view of an alien\\'s genitals, hanging from his chin, and where of course, J punches him, causing much pain (for the alien, and the audience). There are the cheap jokes like these that ruin this film, another being where Rip Torn (reprising his role) jumps up in the air, and we see a shot of him (obviously hanging from cables) kicking at the enemy, but the thing is, he stays in the air for about ten seconds, swinging his legs, like a crossbreed between Shaggy from Scooby-Doo, and a Looney Tune character. Not a single person laughed at this scene.  All this closes with a witless and unimaginative climax, including a repeat from the ending of MIB, involving a locker, but I won\\'t spoil it anymore for you (though it doesn\\'t matter-it was stupid).\\n  A tip to writers: next time, come up with something that has some important key elements, called humor, originality and wit: something the first MIB had.   2/5 stars-                           John Ulmer\"', '\"SPOILER I saw this movie yesterday, and let me just say that 007 has returned after a long absence. The final showdown is truely great and so stupid at the same time. But, with a Bond picture, you are supposed to suspend belief.Also, Brosnan plays two Bonds. The first is the usual one, all hero, but take a look in his eyes as he is being released after 14 months in a Korean jail and it you can see fear in his eyes. I don\\'t think that Connery or Moore could of played Bond like this. Funniest moment has got to be the moment that a bedraggled Bond walks into the Hong Kong hotel and asks for a room. That was the moment that it changed from being serious and back to the world that we expect from 007.\"', '\"I knew going in to this movie that it would suck.  Man was I wrong...  It was so bad that it rocked!  I rarely have this much fun with other hollywood crap.From one of the first race scenes where some Pizza guy shows up, to the last cheesy, incredibly lame line, this movie really shines.  If you like to heckle movies, this is it.  The king.  Better than the worst movie to ever come out of Canada.The acting sucked, the plot sucked, and best of all, the dialogue was straight out of a Wisconsin cheese factory.  And the emotional moments? Absolute hilarity!!I found it amusing that other commenters have compared this movie to point break.  It does have amazing similarity, yet it is so much more funny!  I always thought Keanu Reeves was the greatest, but I was wrong.I gave it a 1 for the simple fact that IMDB has it rated at 7.0 right now!!! We must offset the incorrect ratings!!!  I\\'d give it a 10 for the laugh factor, but then I just cringe.\"', '\"What a crap...2 police-Negroids trying to be funny and awesome. And the music in the movie!!! Its hard rock all the time, just to be hefty...i say it again, wow....and the scene in the beginning with the KKK. Of course they must have a scene like that when it is two Negroids in the movie...I\\'m no racist, but this is too much. You start to wonder why...I cant get it, who really like this movies. Have that people ever been on a cinema......? You really start to wonder. Michael Bay has made two good movies, and that is The Rock and Armageddon. This is just one good joke that doesn\\'t fulfill nothing at all. The whole story just runs on track like a train. No meaning, no sub-content, no nothing. See something else.\"', '\"Any movie that can make Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez look like decent actresses should have succeeded, but it unfortunately didn\\'t. Paul Walker was just starting his career and was a little rough and Vin Diesel gives his usual grunts and groans performance. The movie is loud, but what would you expect from this type of film. It basically proves that fast cars, and fast women equal fun.In this film you have teenagers around 16-19 who have high performance cars, but give you the impression that they couldn\\'t screw in a light bulb without help, and somehow in the film the police are nowhere to be found despite the roar of 800 horsepower engines.A minor diversion, but a movie that makes no sense.(*1/2) Out Of (****)\"', '\"Mission Impossible II is full of cool looking Action stunts,Tom looks completely cool in his Leather Jacket,long hair,with his sunglasses,yet the film bored me half the time,rather then thrilling me. I have never been a big fan of John Woo\\'s,I often find many of his films to be overblown,and unexciting,in fact the only film I\\'ve liked of his,is Face Off. Mission Impossible II is no different. It\\'s overly loud,brash and not sophisticated like the 1st one was. Mission Impossible managed to thrill us,with perfectly orchestrated suspense,here it turns into an action lovers feast. Â•There\\'re shootouts,Tom and Dougray wrestling around on motorcycles,Tom avoiding bullets,unfortunately it\\'s all highly unrealistic looking,and took away a lot of enjoyment for me. The fight scene near the end though,is shockingly well done. Tom showed quite the acrobatic skills,despite no Martial Arts training what so ever,it was all done to perfection. I also enjoyed how Thandie Newton\\'s character was developed. She\\'s completely unpredictable as Nyah|A bit too much at times,if you asked me| mysterious,we never know where she truly stands until the halfway point.Mission Impossible II entertains at some points,but it\\'s just much too stupid for it\\'s own good,completely brainless stuff.Performances. Tom Cruise\\'s charisma is able to make this film a lot better then it should be. He is the epitome of cool here,walking around with a black leather jacket,expensive sunglasses,his hair all done up,he looks like a bad ass. Ethan Doesen\\'t have the depth that he does in the 1st film,and this completely hurts Tom In the long run. Tom,however is able to bring his own brand of acting to Ethan this time around,to give us a character we can root for. His chemistry with Newton was also on the money. Thandie Newton is certainly good looking,that\\'s for sure. As far as her acting is concerned,she managed to do a pretty adequate job,making her character as unpredictable as it comes. Dougray Scott is a decent villain. He\\'s somewhat bland,but managed to get the job done when it counted. Ving Rhames is too cool for school. He added class,just like he did in the 1st. Richard Roxburgh is decent as Stamp,I liked his style for the most part. John Polson is funny as the other team member,basically the comic relief though. Brendan Gleeson is decent in his shady written part. Rade Serbedzija has a memorable accent,I\\'ll say that.Bottom Line. Mission Impossible II is a failure as far as a followup goes. On it\\'s own it\\'s a mildly entertaining sequel at best,I\\'ll say it again,having John Woo at the helm was a big mistake. Worth a look,but don\\'t expect the original,and you might wanna bring some aspirin with you,due to the utter stupidity of the plot sometimes.6/10\"', '\"The remake of the 1971 original is in fact, in my opinion, better than the original.  There is definitely more action, the plot makes more sense, and you actually know something about the bad guys.  Samuel L Jackson dominates the film from the moment he enters the screen, and Christian Bale is solid as the bad guy.  The ending shootout and car chase is exciting and fast paced.  Highly recommended, for anyone who likes police thrillers. 4/5\"', '\"This was a dull, plodding, unbelievable in the extreme, badly filmed, badly scored, badly plotted, boring unfunny effort of an action movie...it was too over the top in terms of action (when there was any), and the non-action scenes were mostly pointless and VERY boring....you would do better to burn your movie then go to a theater to see this piece of cinematic drivel.....and believe me, I can appreciate an action movie as much as the next person, but this one is BAD....\"', '\"This movie was excellent.. besides the acting with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.. But the cars were excellent like the Mazda Rx-7, Toyota Supra 1994 edition and the Honda S2000 and more..... Also the women were great like Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez... This movie was a 9 had some bad parts and some great parts too... Cant wait for the second one\"', '\"When I saw the second sequence in which Tom Cruise, as Ethan Hunt, climbs cliffs in Arizona and leaps between them like Spiderman, I figured \"hmm, this must be like one of those high tech holo-deck training thingies they must have in the IMF now.\" I was wrong. For some reason the audience is supposed to believe that these acrobatics can be performed by any human. And thus continues the movie.This film was directed by John Woo, which was a great choice for the action sequences. Unfortunately, the movie itself didn\\'t have much action in it until the middle of the movie, and the romance sequences between Newton and Cruise were very hollow and trite. The slow motion was overused, and the film was debilitated by the actors\\' tendency to overact to make up for an extremely weak script. The only shining moment in the acting department was Anthony Hopkins, who delivered his lines with good humor and life.The team aspect of the Mission:Impossible series seemed totally lost. It seems Ving Rhames was only brought in for a few laughs and to be the guy sitting in the truck, while the other member of the team was the guy who flew the helicopter, while Cruise\\'s Hunt was the superhero who scaled cliffs, did backflips, and flipped motorcycles while immolating the bad guys.In conclusion, the movie seemed like a bunch of amazing action sequences overlapping a script that was a combination of a trashy romance novel, a world atlas, a comic book, and a cookbook. The characters performed feats from The Matrix, such as human mid-air collisions, but M:I2 didn\\'t pull it off because it was happening in \"real life\" not a computer simulacrum.\"', '\"How could a nuclear device go off, and Jack Ryan is able to go to the Baltimore docks within an hour  - no radiation danger? No \"BLACK RAIN\" ? - His love interest is blown back from imploding glass - within a few miles of the explosion - oh, but she\\'s o.k. The presidential helicopter is thrown to the ground in the blast - but no worries, mate - he\\'s o.k. also. Morgan Freeman - he\\'s the senior black advisor (sort of comparable to the James Earle Jones character in previous Jack Ryan movies) he, as JEJ, is toast! Acting was good by Freeman & Affleck - script was bad, and cinematography post-blast was very weak! And why are the teams playing in the Baltimore stadium, which was Domed in the movie, from Chicago & Florida???????? Clancy - this was obviously written for the screen, not for literature. I\\'m disappointed in Tom\\'s exploitation of a character I had grown to love. (Face it Tom; Jack Ryan is not James Bond -- and I liked it that way)\"', '\"Having seen every Bond film first run in a theater, this film revived my hope in the Bond franchise. Bond films so seldom have any teeth or grit to them anymore. Fleming\\'s lethal and vice-ridden emotionally detached hero turned into a politically correct soft pretty boy in a tuxedo for decades, the series was about to go the way of the dodo. A role finally revived by Daniel Craig.It is unfortunate that they lost their nerve half-way through the plot and decided go the old formulaic route of super-villain causing WWIII. In the first half Bond re-discovers he has a pair and tells M and MI6 where to go, escapes their imprisonment and goes on a personal mission of revenge. In the second half we get the obligatory embedded car advertisement, a ludicrous piece of high-tech junk from Q and a megalomaniac super-villain.I am amazed by the outright hatred of this film by the so-called fans of the franchise. The majority of it directed at Halle Berry has caused me to wonder whether the bad reviews were written by white supremists. She has to be the hottest Bond girl in years (I\\'d have to go back to a 22 year old Jane Seymour in Live and Let Die to top her). Rosamund Pike is a mousy lump of oatmeal in comparison, it\\'s almost like they didn\\'t even try to make her attractive (rather odd since I do like her and Bond women tend to look hotter in Bond films than any other film they\\'ve done).She\\'s certainly not the worst actress to be a Bond girl. That title goes to Tanya Roberts in View to a Kill beating out even Denise Richards for a performance so bad that had opening night fans at \"Grauman\\'s\" Chinese theater howling with laughter at her delivery.And speaking of Live and Let Die, Halle Berry certainly makes up for Gloria Hendry.This is certainly the best of the Brosnan Bond films.\"', '\"Instead of wasting your money and two hours of your life watching the biggest over-baked John Woo film since...John Woo\\'s last film, Face Off!. Brian DePalma, not anywhere to be found on my favorite director\\'s list, really did a top-notch job with the first movie...if people complained that the first movie was too hard to understand, they will be pleased to know that the second movie throws not only logic out the window, but also any sense of adventure, suspense or fun...it\\'s a big disappointment...i can\\'t think of anything else to say because i am still dumbfounded by how LAME this movie is.  I like Tom Cruise, I just don\\'t like John Woo (at least in America). Go rent Mission Impossible, and while your at it, see if you can find Woo\\'s Asian films, like Killer.\"', '\"In recent years George Clooney has produced or directed a number of films such as \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" or \"The Men who Stare at Goats\", most of which reflect his left-liberal political convictions. These convictions are not, however, always so well reflected in his choice of films as an actor. Witness, for example, the macho action-thriller \"The Peacemaker\". Or, for that matter, \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\", a caper film which- like all caper films- preaches the message that \"Greed is Good\" and which- like an increasing number of modern examples of the genre- adds a further message to the effect that \"Crime does Pay\".Here Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, a career criminal who comes up with a plan to rob a vast sum of money the vaults of three Las Vegas casinos, the Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. Now the man in the street might think this scheme to be a thoroughly dishonest one, but for the purposes of the film we are expected to regard it as a highly laudable enterprise because the owner of the three casinos, Terry Benedict, is portrayed as an unpleasant, thuggish gangster. Benedict is also the current lover of Danny\\'s ex-wife, Tess, so under the moral code which governs caper movies Danny has two quite legitimate reasons to steal from him with a clear conscience.Now the Las Vegas gambling scene may have been under the control of the Mob back in the days of Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, but I always understood that these days the Nevada Gaming Commission are keen to keep it squeaky-clean and to exclude anyone with criminal connections from having anything to do with running the casinos. It therefore seemed odd that the film-makers could, without falling foul of the laws of libel, imply that three major casinos (all of which are real institutions) are owned and run by an obviously crooked individual like Benedict. It seemed even odder that the real owners of the Bellagio welcomed the film and allowed the team to shoot on location. It seems that in some businesses any publicity is good publicity.I won\\'t go into details of Danny\\'s scheme to relieve Benedict of some of his ill-gotten wealth, except to say it is extremely complicated in order to overcome the casinos\\' elaborate security precautions. (You probably have to watch the film several times to understand it fully). Suffice it to say that it is so complicated that Danny needs to recruit no fewer than ten former colleagues and other criminals, each with his own special skills, in order to pull it off- hence the title of the film. To British eyes the title \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" would appear to have sporting overtones, as both soccer and cricket are played between teams of eleven men, but as both sports are much less popular in America than they are here these overtones were presumably unintended.Given such a large cast, it is not surprising that there is no serious attempt made at characterisation and hence no really outstanding acting performances. Although the film was made with an ensemble cast, however, the film-makers managed to attract a surprisingly large number of big-name stars, including not only those two great male sex-symbols Gorgeous George and Beau Brad but also the likes of Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould, Andy Garcia and Don Cheadle.\"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" is a slick, glossy piece of popular entertainment- a sort of superior popcorn movie; I enjoyed it more than the rather dull sequel \"Ocean\\'s Twelve\". (I must admit that I have not seen either \"Ocean\\'s Thirteen\", the third episode in the franchise, or the original Rat Pack \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" from 1960). My main concern about it is its apparent rewriting of the Ten Commandments so that the eighth now reads \"Thou Shalt Steal\". It is by no means unique in that respect among modern films, but at least the likes of \"Entrapment\" were honest about their own dishonesty. \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" seems to be going out of its way to justify theft and robbery provided that the owner of the stolen property is sufficiently unpleasant to make him a legitimate target. 6/10\"', '\"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME MAJOR SPOILERS. DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU\\'VE SEEN THE FILM!Antony Hopkins bookends this film with a brief cameo as Ethan\\'s boss. I dunno about you, but I find it hard to watch the actor nowadays without being constantly reminded of an advert he did for a certain bank, where everything was \\'big\\'. \"There\\'s a big bloke with a big bald head and he\\'s eating a big bag of sweets making a big noise. Then there\\'s five big girls having a big chat through the film and one\\'s got a big smoker\\'s cough and she\\'s hacking her guts up in a big way. Then there\\'s a big idiot who left his big mobile phone on and it\\'s letting off a big ring\". Yeah, the cinema can be an annoying place sometimes. But back to the film. There\\'s a line of dialogue where Hopkins describes how by using a female thief on the mission they will reward her by deleting her criminal record. The record, he tells us, will be \"expunged\" (pauses, then adds for those who don\\'t know expunged means) -  \"wiped out\". The whole film is like this. Every time a vaguely clever plot point is revealed, the movie then immediately spells it out in bright big letters just for the members of the audience too thick to get it.It\\'s films like this that make you think you\\'ve either seen too many movies or that it\\'s just blindly obvious what\\'s going to happen next. This is no more apparent than with the wearily predictable series of face/voice doubles (c. Face/Off), the worst being Tom, running for his life, yet stopping to take off his mask. Hey, look audience! It was Tom all along! Even though the guy that looked like Tom is already revealed to be the henchman, here\\'s Tom taking his mask off just in case you\\'re dead from the neck up. Assuming, of course, you didn\\'t know that the swap had taken place within the first five seconds anyway. See also: Oh My God, I cannot possibly guess what she\\'s going to do with that hypodermic spray gun!!!John Woo\\'s direction is the big star of the show (and yes, Tom does get to do a \"jumping sideways in slow motion while firing two guns simultaneously\"), the colour of the movie a pleasant autumnal red/brown in contrast to DePalma\\'s original clinical winter shades. In fact, he\\'s the ideal director for this outing, as, while the first had pleasing complexity, this one is a by the book (if not - quite - by the numbers) actioner. The plot is non-existent, a mere 10 minutes\\' worth of events, to whit: bad-guys-steal-virus. Good-guys-steal-back-virus. The fact that this thin premise is expanded to two hours means everything else is just irrelevant padding and trimmings. Look at the first fifty minutes. Cruise steals a chip that tells him the secret of the deadly virus (Clue: It\\'s deadly!) Yet we knew that before the opening credits, so why do we need to wait for Tom to find out? Like Connery finding out how they stole the nukes in \"Thunderball\", this is a time-filling game of catch-up. And surely his bosses would have known what the virus was capable of anyway? This is expounded by a fat Englishman in a hospital who only exists to give the most blatant display of clunky exposition I\\'ve been privileged to witness. Except he comes back to life or something, and I must admit I didn\\'t get that bit, I was distracted - keep the noise down with those sweet wrappers!!!Dougray Scott is good as the Scottish (what, not English?) villain who pronounces Ethan\\'s surname like it\\'s a form of East End rhyming slang. Thandie Newton\\'s appearance in the first half of the film revolves around her breasts, while the second sees her redundant and looking pensive to what sounds like the lovechild of Clannad. Ving Rhames is Ving Rhames; the cool-sounding stereotypical black guy that does all the work while the Caucasian with the impossibly white teeth gets the glory. I half expected his credit to read \"Uncle Tom\", but I was left disappointed.Things to look out for: a blatant steal from Darkman (and I\\'m not talking about the faces - think cigar cutter time) and an ending which - perhaps geekily - reminded me of the last McCoy Doctor Who story. Except that after the Doctor did a motorbike clash, he didn\\'t end it by beating the crap out of the Master in a martial arts video game that went on and on and on for fifteen minutes. Maybe I\\'m just not enough of a bloke to appreciate it, but my testosterone is of a controllable level, so that I don\\'t watch karate fights that bore and go \"Wow! That was way way cool!\" I just think - where\\'s the plot?If this were the first film in a franchise then I would be predicting its demise. As it\\'s a continuation from a superior original then I guess it does a reasonable job of treading water and will ensure that Cruise will once again take on board a mission that is, if not impossible, then moderately entertaining.\"', '\"One of the worst movies I\\'ve seen in quite some time.  And considering I went in with low expectations, that speaks volumes.  It directly ripped off a scene from Last of the Mohicans, and ripped off its general feel from all the bond movies.  Not only is this movie not a sequel to Mission Impossible the TV series, it isn\\'t even a sequel to Mission Impossible the movie. I\\'m not sure if I can say this movie sucked, but only because I think that comment might be censored.  This movie was predictable, lame and annoyingly plagiaristic.  I can\\'t say enough poor things about this movie.  If I can help even one person from spending their hard earned money on this movie, then perhaps my misspent dollars are not gone completely in vain.Did I mention that John Woo (of whom I am generally a fan) did his worst work yet here?  His methods (e.g. slo-mo to build up drama and emphasize action) are tedious here.  The instant deep bond between the two main characters is ridiculous (\\'hey we almost killed each other!  Let\\'s sleep together and form a lasting love bond\\') and all the other relationships are barely more believable.  Again, I don\\'t think I can count in 1000 words how many ways this movie was disappointing!So I\\'ll stop at 234 words with saying that this movie wasn\\'t even worth a rental rate.\"', '\"The worst I have seen and I have seen them all at least 20 times each.This one is a homage to Brian DePalma who is notorious for stealing scenes from great directors to make a movie (See Untouchable with scenes stolen from Hitchcock; Eisenstein, etc.) In this Bond, the weapon is stolen from Diamonds are Forever, The Hale Berry laser scene is a copy of the Goldfinger laser scene which by the way was voted as one of the most memorable movie scenes with the famous line from Auric G. \"No Mr. Bond; I expect you to die\". The Astom Martin is a throw back to Goldfinger/Thunderball.James Bond, the main character, once the most suave, dashing, sexiest and for lack of a better word \"the most perfect man alive\", who made some of the most gorgeous women in the world surrender themselves to him and compelled men to wishing they were him, has been castrated in this movie.It seems that since Judy Dench took over as M in Goldeneye, all the male employees of MI6 have become impotent and occupy secondary roles. Our hero is totally ineffective in this movie and is cast aside to a secondary role while Dench, Berry, Pike and Moneypenny are elevated to hero status. ITS A \"CHICK BOND\" WORLD I GUESSThe opening scene is supposed to be the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, except there is military presence!Our hero, who in the past opening sequences managed to escape from the most dire of situations relying on his gadgets and instincts is caught. Hint to Write and/or Director: BOND NEVER GETS CAUGHT; HE IS SUPER AGENTA Female Korean soldier is in charge of torturing Bond, who we are told is suspected of cracking under pressure and revealing secrets. This the symbolic castration and conveys the message that Bond is castrated.Berry throughout the movie is portrayed as superior to Bond. In fact Berry\\'s character is exactly what Bond was in the past (now you know why I call this movie \"Chick Bond\")Moneypenny the secretary knows about MI6\\'s most secret meeting place, but our Super Agent only suspects it existed. (Its a \"Bond Chick\" world)Pike\\'s character, which I am still not sure whether she is a \"00\" or not, apparently has more of \"M\"\\'s confidence that the man who has served Her Majesty\\'s government since the 1960s with a perfect track record (See it is a \"Chick Bond\" world)Madonna sings the theme song (Final proof that this a \"Chick Bond\" version of a great franchise)While Bond always had the best gadgets, the bad guys have even better ones that can beat Bond\\'s which is a symbolic castration of his character as well.The entire movie would make the \"NOW\" happy, but made a life long fan like me want to sit down and watch all of Connery\\'s Bond movies.BEST SCENE: Bond cruising down a Havana highway driving an immaculate 1950s Ford Galaxy with a Latin version of the opening theme playing.WORST SCENE: The rest of this waste of money, time and material.\"', '\"This was an entertaining movie despite being unoriginal.  The characters are suprisingly well-developed, and the cars are pretty cool- though, being from the Detroit area, I was hoping for a bigger dose of Motor City muscle. But, it\\'s true to its So-Cal setting and mindset.  Unfortunately the story has already been done- replace the racers with surfers, the trucks with banks, Vin Diesel with Patrick Swayze and voila, you have Point Break.  Still, it\\'s a joyride to be sure, with awesome (albeit being obviously staged) car stunts and a \\'furious\\' pace.  If you like fast cars and drag-racing, you\\'ll enjoy this movie.\"', '\"If you are looking for a deep theatrical experience, to be challenged, moved or have your mind opened to new ways of looking at things; if you want to see stereotypes debunked or to become a better person for the experience of seeing a movie - MI2 is probably not the best choice for you !This is James Bond meets the Matrix.  This is a high-energy, gadget laden amusement park thrill ride, and a jolly good one it is too.  The music is superb, the special effects are breath-taking - especially the opening sequence.  The plot is about as deep as a Scotsman\\'s pockets and as predictable as Old Faithful but hey, its stylishly directed and an excellent way to be simply entertained in an adrenaline-centric sort of way for a couple of hours.  Make sure you see it at a good theatre with thunderous sound and a huge screen.  Call me shallow, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.\"', '\"The actors are slick.  The heist is slick.  The costuming is slick.  In fact, this whole movie is just, well, slick.  What can you expect from a remake of a Rat Pack film?George Clooney can only play affable crooks well.  Look at O Brother, Where Art Thou.  Look at Out of Sight.  Look at From Dusk Til Dawn.  All affable criminals, and all excellent.  On the other hand, look at that travesty of a Batman movie, and see how George Clooney can really only play one role.Fortunately, this movie has him in that role once more.  And it\\'s smashing.The amount of male eye candy in this movie is astounding.  At least three of the leads are extremely attractive.  Men are less fortunate.  Julia Roberts\\'s upper lip is larger than her lower lip, which I\\'ve never noticed before; I can\\'t help wondering about possible collagen implants.  She plays a snotty little wench in this movie, without much character development, but then this movie isn\\'t about the characters.It\\'s about The Heist, like all heist movies are.  The mechanics of this one put some other movies of this type to shame, but it\\'s all very slick.  You never really worry about whether they\\'ll pull it off, but seeing exactly how they do it is just as fun anyway.Don\\'t miss this one; it\\'s extremely well-crafted, like all Soderbergh\\'s pictures are.\"', '\"Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are back as (respectively) Agents `K\\' and `J,\\' to once again save the world and keep the universe in order, in `Men In Black II,\\' directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, a Sci-Fi/comedy/action film that confirms something we\\'ve all suspected for a long time-- that most of the people who work at the Post Office are really aliens in human form (and doesn\\'t that go for the DMV, as well?).  And rest assured, it all comes with plenty of alien activity and is served up with a healthy dose of wry humor and `new hotness.\\'  In short, if you\\'ve seen the original and/or the trailers for this one, you end up getting exactly what you expect-- and you\\'ll sleep better at night knowing that the Men in Black are out there keeping us safe.Agent K has been `retired\\' for some time, but recent alien activity involving a particularly ruthless alien by the name of Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) necessitates bringing K back into service, as it appears that Serleena is seeking something called the `Light of Zartha,\\' and if she succeeds in her quest it will spell disaster for the world.      And buried in K\\'s memory is information vital to the MIB effort to thwart Serleena. So J is dispatched to bring K back and deneuralize him, so together they can attempt to stave off the evil Serleena and save the world.  It won\\'t be easy, however, because Serleena is already a step ahead of them, and right out of the chute they encounter a couple of obstacles:  A young woman named Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson) needs their help and protection because of something she\\'s seen; and to get K back into action, J has to engage the help of Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub), who demurs, afraid of `losing\\' his head again with K around.  And that hurts.  J prevails, however, and soon K is back in the last suit he\\'ll ever own-- again.Sonnenfeld relies heavily on the visual aspects of this one, which is wise in light of the fact that there is more by way of F/X available to him than story this time around.  And he uses it all to great effect; the bottom line is, this movie is about one thing-- entertainment.  And that\\'s what you get. There\\'s enough story to keep the audience involved, but it\\'s nothing that\\'s going to strain the brain cells.  It may seem contradictory, but the originality and imagination Sonnenfeld employs here is nothing new-- it\\'s there, but it\\'s really just an extension of all that was generated in the original `Men In Black.\\'  Still, it\\'s used well, and Sonnenfeld keeps it all moving along at a brisk pace that keeps it fun and engaging.  What really sells it, though, are the performances-- especially those of Smith and Jones.Will Smith steps right back into his character with facility, and he has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence that make him fun to watch. Smith draws heavily upon his own winning personality in bringing J to life, and he has the timing and a way of delivering his lines that make his character extremely personable.  And that\\'s exactly what a movie like this needs.  This isn\\'t a project that calls for any in-depth character analysis; still, Smith develops J enough to make him well rounded and credible-- and that\\'s enough.  It works.  Most importantly, Smith holds his own with the F/X, and the lack of pretense in his performance is refreshing.As K, Tommy Lee Jones gives Smith the perfect straight-man to play off of, and right from the beginning he so perfectly captures that lethargic Postal Worker countenance, giving new definition to the word `droll.\\'  And while J be-bops around (or is that hip-hops?), you get the feeling that as soon as K is back, he\\'s the guy in charge.  And leading up to K\\'s deneuralization, Jones does a good job of affecting a believable sense of hesitancy, of maintaining `observation\\' mode until he gets to the bottom of whatever it is that\\'s going on with this `J\\' character.  You can always depend on Jones to deliver, no matter what role he\\'s playing, and he certainly does here. And the casting is inspired:  Smith and Jones make a great team on screen.Rip Torn is also perfect as MIB director Zed, the guy responsible for keeping tabs on all of this alien business.  His character is inherently stereotypical, but Torn at least adds a personal touch and plays him quite well, putting some real life into his portrayal.  It\\'s a good performance inasmuch as Torn lends some zest and personality to a character that could have served little purpose other than that of being a vehicle by which to move the plot along.  And it demonstrates how much a great character actor like Rip Torn can bring to any film.Lara Flynn Boyle does a good job in the less-than-challenging role of Serleena, a character which affords her little opportunity to do more than look good and generate a sense of evil, both of which she succeeds in doing effectively.  The main thing is, she manages to establish who Serleena is, which is pivotal to the success of the film.The supporting cast includes Johnny Knoxville (Scrad/Charlie), Patrick Warburton (Agent T), Jack Kehler (Ben), David Cross (Newton) and Jeremy Howard (Bird Guy Postal Sorting Alien).  Like the man said, `There\\'s nothing new under the sun,\\' which is certainly the case with `Men In Black II,\\' which in essence is a continuation of the original, a kind of `Further Adventures Of\\' the MIB.  But it\\'s well done, fun and entertaining-- it\\'s a kick just being able to spend some more time with these guys.  And if you\\'re a fan of the original and you go into this one expecting more of the same, rather than hoping to be dazzled by something entirely new, it\\'ll be a satisfying, worthwhile experience.  7/10.\"', '\"Probably Ocean\\'s Eleven is the best Ocean\\'s Trilogy movies\"', '\"I was lucky enough to view this film in a sneak preview the night before it\\'s opening.  I have never seen the original, but I must say that this movie was great entertainment that had me laughing, and on the edge of my seat.The characters in the film could have been developed some more, but their chemistry together was particularly both amusing and cooperative.The director of this film, after his huge success with Traffic, has definitely shown himself again as a somewhat experimental filmmaker.  His various uses of Extreme Close Ups and rapid montage are excellent and thought provoking, and his hypnotic way of using just the right volume of music at the right time puts you in perspective with the characters.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this film is that I, myself, felt like Andy Garcia\\'s character.  This is because the main cast of thieves kept on surprising the audience little by little, leaving the detective work to us.  I truly could not figure anything out of any one scene until the scene was over.  This was experimental, because some viewers don\\'t like to try and figure things out, but I believe that it worked.There are a few problems with the film.  One of the problems is that the very talented Matt Damon seemed to have been placed on a low key throughout the film, and the hysterical Bernie Mac seemed to have been given a low profile in the editing room.However, I still enjoyed this movie tremendously, routed for the bad guys like I was supposed to, and I would recommend this movie to anybody with a free Saturday night.I rate this film : ********  (Eight out of Ten)\"', '\"... If you\\'re dating a 15 year old... This movie is plane out silly. Great fighting scenes, but done and seen before. There\\'s nothing new to this, but far out stupidities. It seems to be an attempt to make an action-movie for girls, but why didn\\'t they cast Spice Girls then? That\\'d be GIRL-POWER.\\nThis did nothing for me, sorry. I was shocked to learn it was directed by a man, but as they say in 12 Monkeys: Whatever get\\'s it up for you, JACK!\"', '\"I thought it was an entertaining movie, but I was still quite disappointed with it.  It seems like they just took the things that everyone liked from the first film and focused on them, without bothering to come up with a story of some kind.  Even the special effects looked bad in this one for some reason.  I saw it on pay per view in a hotel so it might have been the television, but it looked like they didn\\'t put as much time and effort into the effects for this film as they did for the original.It was a silly and unoriginal movie.  You\\'ll get some laughs out of it, but you\\'ll forget you ever saw it ten minutes after the credits roll. Considering the length of time they had between this film and the original, they should have been able to come up with something better.\"', '\"I wouldn\\'t call this \\'trashy\\' goods. It\\'s a perfectly good Hollywood script. Besides the car \\'dueling\\' action sequences, it includes energy of the younger set (20 something\\'s), the eagerness to experience risks, and the plight to feel the spirit of freedom - even if it\\'s a matter of moments. Death is not an ominous worry to them. They live for the moment.\\nPaul Walker is in the lead role of Brian, the undercover LA cop. He has worked with director Rob Cohen before in \"The Skulls\" 2000. Rob Cohen directed the \"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story\" 1993 with Jason Scott Lee and Lauren Holly. Also \"Dragonheart\" 1993, a fable of a legend with Sean Connery doing voice of the Dragon which Dennis Quaid gallantly duels with. Cohen\\'s movies may be Hollywood, yet they tend to have a backbone ethical/living outlook that prompts the integrity of the central character(s).\\nVin Diesel is Dominic, the rebellious one here - can past as James Dean, the leader whom the gang looks up to. He stood out in \"Boiler Room\" 2000, opposite Giovanni Ribisi, and was the only good thing in \"Pitch Black\" 2000, the sci-fi flick which he was the lead opposite Radha Mitchell (from \"High Art\" 1998 opposite Ally Sheedy.)Jordana Brewster was last seen as the furiously grieving sister of Cameron Diaz in \"The Invisible Circus\" playing opposite Christopher Eccleston (who\\'s in \"Gone in 60 Seconds,\" another fast cars and chase flick). Brewster is Dominic\\'s feisty sister Mia, furiously sulky here besides having a chance to be fast (driving, matching up to the testosterone bunch.) Michelle Rodriguez is Dominic\\'s woman, full of anger within, charged with a devil may care defiance. The role of Johnny by Rick Yune has a flavor of Giovanni Ribisi\\'s energy as in \"Gone in 60 Seconds.\" But Cohen\\'s \"The Fast and the Furious\" is comparably more substantial and colorful in storyline and character development, even comes with a \\'dream\\' quote for the fast and the furious: \"I live my life quarter of a mile per second at a timeÂ…nothing else mattersÂ…in those 10 seconds, I\\'m free.\" And the backbone that held together the friendship between Walker and Diesel\\'s characters is soundly strong.\\nBe sure to stay on to the very end of the movie - after all the credits roll, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker you\\'ll see, and you get to hear Dominic\\'s quote once again (besides receiving a satisfying closure to the story.)\"', '\"\"Bad Boys 2\" is an excellent sequel the 90\\'s Classic original & this time everything is louder & more explosive with non-stop stylish action sequences & non-stop laughs from the incredible teaming of Will Smith & Martin Lawrence!!!\\nThe feelgood fun chemistry is back along with our two Cool as hell Miami Cops \"Mike Lowry\" & \"Marcus Burnett\" who are up to their necks in more dangerous shootouts & explosions as they battle a new Druglord who has taken over the Miami drug trade, this sequel is a fun ride, it\\'s a blast as our Cops kickass through the Miami underworld of gangsters & thugs, the movie looks spectacular with it\\'s sun drenched Miami look & the real over saturated gritty colour so the cinematography is gorgeous, the action is still bloody & brutal with some Awesome action set pieces.The Action obsessed Director Michael Bay does great here with his stylistic way of shooting & stylish look & tone it\\'s definitely a \"Michael Bay\" film but a great one!!!\\nWill Smith is great here again as the sexy, smooth & cool tough Cop Mike Lowry & here he\\'s huge, a pumped up almost wrestler looking version of Smith & his charm is on full flow here.\\nMartin Lawrence is excellent here again as the funny family man of the duo who is hilarious & does some of the funniest bits in the movie.\\nAll in all it\\'s a hot action packed Crime Thriller with two of the best movie cops out there!!!\\nWill Smith is a living legend & my all time favourite actor.\"', '\"The films Ok, it isn\\'t a great and certainly not Jackson\\'s best.

I would recommend it.\"', '\"When it comes to female leads in action roles, the names Angelina Jolie or Milla Jovovich may come to mind. They play serious roles with a tad bit of wisecracks and a bunch of violence, specifically with weapons. When that genre is flipped on its head and made into an action comedy, it then fits for a different set of actresses. In some ways, this movie is the definition of how masculine a chick flick can possibly get. It still has all the basic set-ups for a chick flick, but this time it includes explosions and hand-to-hand combat. There\\'s nothing wrong with that particular element, but as a whole it really doesn\\'t have any substance that defines itself from other chick flicks of that decade (other than its explosions and combat).Charlie\\'s Angels (2000) is another cinema adapted TV show from the 1970s that hoped to capitalize on its nostalgic feel while mixing in Hollywood\\'s biggest grabs at the time. Our main protagonists are Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu as the spy trio who take orders from a faceless billionaire named by Charlie (voice by John Forsythe). Helping them in their travels and spy tactics is Bosley (Bill Murray). When they receive a distress call about a scientist (Sam Rockwell) being kidnapped, they head out to infiltrate and save him. This is all fine but everything else involved in the writing is fairly one-dimensional. I\\'m guessing because all three writers were guys and they had no clue what to include except the clichÃ© things.Problems arise in the movie\\'s plot when the story tries to focus on each of the Spys\\' personal lives. Each Angel is in the state of \"Ugh, I can\\'t find a way to balance my professional career with my social life\". Though somehow, one would think when they agreed to work for Charlie they would\\'ve understood that from the start. Besides, these particular subplots didn\\'t go anywhere anyway. There wasn\\'t much closure at all other than what you would expect when it came to the main plot. Along with that are either some obvious sexual humor, meaning to play off of the female leads. Some of it might produce a chuckle but sometimes it painstakingly bad. There\\'s even some jokes that may not be understood at all.There are also appearances from other actors you wouldn\\'t expect to see too often. Matt LeBlanc, Tom Green, Luke Wilson, Crispin Glover and even Tim Curry. Sadly everyone mentioned before Curry gets more screen time than he does. Tim Curry will always be an underrated actor and he should\\'ve been given more screen time. How do you shorthand Tim Curry? But Curry did at least sumo fight Murry. That was funny. When it came to action however, it entertained. Hand-to-hand combat is always more interesting to watch than constant explosions because there is always room for improvisation. This also what helps make this movie more fun than a normal chick flick because our three main leads have not taken on very many action roles in their career. It\\'s a nice turn.Of course a number of action sequences aren\\'t believable at times but they at least will keep the attention of the viewer. That\\'s important. The camera-work was fairly steady and the cinematography by Russell Carpenter looked good. It wasn\\'t breath taking, but there were nice set pieces and backgrounds he did get shots of. The music by Ed Shearmur was interesting at best. There were moments where he was able to create some good tension while at other times it didn\\'t work or there was contemporary music played instead. Mehh,...it was alright. What did surprise me was how many times the movie tried to make references to angels in general. Come on, we get it. No need to hammer it in to our skulls. It\\'s an OK film.Its humor helps slightly in its favor along with likable leads, fun action and underrated supporting actors like Bill Murry and Tim Curry. Yet, it still can\\'t remove itself from feeling like a chick flick.\"', '\"Terribly overblown action flick offering nothing in the way of plot or character development. Since when did Bond films become so mindless? Ian Fleming, Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman must be turning over in their graves. There is absolutely zero intrigue in this one. It just races from one action sequence to the next seemingly without regard to consequence. I won\\'t even examine the performances of the actors, because nobody was given the chance to act, save for being stand-ins for the stuntmen. Even the bad Bond movies of the past (ex:Man with the Golden Gun) always had a certain style and mood to them and tried to make the plot believable. This reminds me of Mission Impossible II, where they got a director who obviously didn\\'t do his homework on the series and/or just wanted to leave his own imprint. That said, this is not even a good spy action movie on its own, XXX was ten times better! Could this be the end of the Bond series? Doubtful, but it should be, unless the make a clean break (like they did after comedic Moonraker) and return to the elements which set Bond films apart in the first place.\"', '\"Sure, there\\'s a Roman numeral appended to this movie, and we all know what that means. It means someone decided to eke some more cash from the first movie in a series. Which is not in itself such a nasty, horrible thing, but all to often sequels are awash in dreckery, hodge-podge, and undying crapitude.The original MIB starred Will Smith as Agent Jay and Tommy Lee Jones as Agent Kay, part of a superdupersecret organization that monitored the activities of aliens on Planet Earth. At the end of the first movie, Kay neuralizes himself, erasing all memory of his MIB adventures, choosing instead to retire from active duty and leaving Jay to handle those mean ol\\' aliens all on his own.As MIB II begins, Kay\\'s now a postmaster. Yep, you read that right, a postmaster. In a small town. Wny, he\\'s about as removed from alien adventurin\\' as one could get. Meanwhile, Jay is BAOC (big agent on campus) in the land of MIB, answering directly to Zed (Rip Torn).Which is all fine and dandy till some oversexed strumpet (Lara Flynn Boyle) from outta space lands on Earth (okay, so she\\'s not really female or human, but rather takes the guise of a model in a victoria\\'s Secret catalog) to find some special light that was supposedly left there back in the day. If she/it finds the light, the planet is doomed. So she takes MIB headquarters hostage. I mean, after all, who wouldn\\'t? It seems like the right thing to do.Jay\\'s the only agent left running loose, coincidentally, but it\\'s Kay who holds the right information in his now-addled brain, info that could Save the World from Destruction. Trouble is, Kay can\\'t remember a darn thing, being neuralized and all. He doesn\\'t even remember being an agent.\\nCan Jay deneuralize Kay? Can they both save the world? Will Lara Flynn Boyle ham it up as the evil temptress, or will she try to save her career and turn in some decent work? YES! YES! NO!This is truly a popcorn movie, although I forgot to eat popcorn while watching it. It\\'s the kind of movie where you do other things while watching the DVD. You look up every now and then, see alien guts being spilled or hear witty repartee, and then go back to what you\\'re doing. It\\'s not a thinking man\\'s movie; it\\'s more of a slouching man\\'s movie.And that\\'s just fine. That\\'s what the original movie was, after all. Smith and Jones are excellent and appealing; they have great chemistry onscreen. Think Gibson and Glover in Lethal Weapon, or Dreyfuss and Estevez in Stakeout. Boyle\\'s a good foil, but she\\'s mostly ineffectual. After all, it\\'s the boys\\' show.\"', '\"Featuring a killer soundtrack, some amazing stunts and special effects, and some bad ass babes, Charlie\\'s Angels is destined to become a very lucrative franchise. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu head up the cast of a very cool, very stylish film that has all the markings of a summer film, but in the fall. The three Angels are an elite fighting force run by a reclusive millionaire named Charlie. Lead by their boss Bosley (Bill Murray), the ladies are always trying to save the world from disaster. The movie starts with an opening sequence that would make James Bond blush, with a midair parachute chase and explosion. We get a little but of a back story of the girls, but nothing too specific. Then the story kicks in. It seems as if a famous software company\\'s owner has been kidnapped by a rival. The plan is to combine the two forces and create a system that can track any person in the world, by their voice and their phone. The Angels are recruited to help find the company owner and foil the plot. But with a somewhat predictable plot turn, everything gets flipped upside down, and soon the Angels are fighting for their own lives, as well as the lives of Bosley and Charlie.\\nI\\'m thinking plot isn\\'t a huge issue in this movie. The movie is all about explosions, fighting, killer outfits, and of course, the Angels. Right from the start, if you don\\'t like Diaz, Barrymore or Liu, you aren\\'t going to like this film. Their personalities are what carry the movie. I find them all pretty likeable, and of course extremely attractive. But director McG makes sure that even on the off chance you don\\'t like the girls, there is a lot more going on to keep you involved. The fight scenes are straight out of The Matrix (and in the case of the first fight scene, better) with all three ladies involved in kicking some ass. A lot of slow motion martial arts sequences are used to make it seem cooler, and there\\'s enough cheesy dialogue to rival a Schwarzenegger film. The Angels all play to character as well. Diaz is the cute hot one who doesn\\'t realize how good she looks. She\\'s just very likeable, even when she\\'s in positions she shouldn\\'t be in (such as the Soul Train scene). Liu is the hard-edged girl who looks like she could kick anyone\\'s ass, and generally gets the tougher jobs in the film. And Barrymore is the slightly ditzy girl who seems to jump into bed with almost anyone (including her real life boyfriend Tom Green in a strange cameo appearance). But it\\'s also not a situation where the girls are just eye candy. All of them are very strong physically and mentally. They all seem like the kind of girls you\\'d like to hang out with, and at the same time the kind of women that could beat you up in a heartbeat. Nice combination. One great thing about this movie is that it never lets up. I don\\'t remember any time in this movie where there wasn\\'t something going on. A lot of times there is an unnecessary romance that takes up time, or sad parts that take away from the action, but here it was non-stop the entire way through. Yes they threw in some down time, but never for more than a minute. The movie also had a very slick look to it. Very stylish but not over the top comic book hero type style. And the soundtrack was very cool. Whether the music was just in the background, or helping to describe and add to the scene, every song had a purpose. Sometimes music isn\\'t supposed to be in the forefront of a movie, but in these types of all out action films, music helps pump up the audience, and makes the action on the screen that much better. The only things I would have liked to see were a little more of Bill Murray and his comic genius, and a bit more on the background of the Angels. Murray is easily one of the funniest men in film today, but his role was small and his comic talents were kept under wrap. And while I did enjoy the fact that the movie kicked into high gear from the start and kept it up throughout the film, I think a little bit more about how the Angels came to be would have been nice. Maybe in the sequel. So overall I enjoyed Charlie\\'s Angels. It had some great action, some funny moments, a great soundtrack and three hot ladies. Great mindless entertainment for these cold days of winter. I\\'m looking forward to seeing more of the Angels, and some more work from McG.\"', '\"Although director Michael Bay is dangerously close to becoming a caricature of himself, his showy, flashy direction somehow helps BAD BOYS II to be a good, if overlong, film. It\\'s pretty much a clichÃ©d action movie, with an age-old plot, yet revamped with outrageous flashy camera-work, non-stop cutting and editing, and a style of filming which is completely OTT in every respect. The bare-bones story sees cops Smith and Lawrence returning to battle a Cuban drug lord, and getting involved in plenty of shoot-outs and battles throughout. Smith and Lawrence fast-talk their way through a vulgar script peppered with hit-and-miss gags and acquaint themselves well with the action scenario. Said action is often spectacular, ranging from super-fire shoot-outs to an amazing car chase involving a car transporter â€“ excellent special effects make this one to watch.Some may be put off by the ghoulish streak of black comedy running throughout the movie, which peaks as the boys chase a morgue wagon across town, with bodies flying out of the back and disintegrating. For a 15 certificate, this movie has more than its fair share of blood, guts and mayhem, so most action lovers will find themselves at home here. On the downside, it is headache-inducing, what with all the incessant music, and it does outstay its welcome long before the end credits roll. But generally this is solid B-movie fare which just happens to have an AAA budget.\"', '\"Don\\'t let anyone fool you, the Fast and the Furious is a wonderfully entertaining movie. If you saw the trailer and though that it looked like a fun roller coaster ride styled action movie then you are absolutely correct. The best summation you could give of the film is that its like two hours of what you see in the trailer. It\\'s seriously one of the most accurately advertised and needless to say one of the most fun and entertaining movies of the year.The racing scenes have been cleverly filmed and edited together in a way that gives you a false sense of motion with lots of first person views as cars race down the street. In addition, just about every scene in the movie looks really sharp thanks to nice lighting, some visual effects, and just plain good camera work. The direction of camera work for the most part is very traditional in the sense that each major scene is proceeded by a few seconds of a `set up\\' shot that gives you a feeling for the size and surroundings of a scene locale. The majority of the dialogue shots and racing shots are of course third person, however, many of these shots are extremely tight giving you a very strong sense of being there.\\nVin Diesel\\'s performance is convincing and very entertaining. He\\'s extremely enigmatic and seems to have that quality that some actors like Bruce Willis have. That quality of coming off as being an extremely cool person who you just know you\\'d be best friends with. Paul Walker\\'s performance while somewhat wooden, really isn\\'t bad at all. In fact if you really stopped and thought about his character\\'s motivation Paul\\'s on screen apprehension and uncertainty early in the film actually fits his character. Stack that up against his wide eyed and completely commanding on screen presence toward the end of the film and you\\'ve got the complete emotional stages of his character that realistically depicts a man in his situation. The rest of the main cast really deserves a lot of credit too. Sure they might not be a lot well known actors, but I\\'d have to imagine that a few of them will be after a few casting agents see this movie since there really isn\\'t a bad performance in the movie.The writing and dialogue is fairly decent. Sure it isn\\'t the most original story ever, but it does a great job of delivering a plot through the use of a lot of action. The dialogue while a bit awkward a couple of times is for the most part well done.In the end, you won\\'t be disappointed in The Fast and the Furious if you like action movies, cars, or Vin Diesel. The story is decent, the sound and visuals are fantastic, and you\\'ll walk out of the theater with a big smile and the undying urge to drive really reckless while listening to loud music. The PG-13 rating is a very liberal one by the way, people shoot and are shot by guns on screen, some language, some slight skin, but since the movie moves so fast and is so loud, you really think you hear and see more than you actually do. Great movie!\"', '\"Creating new, exciting adventures for 007 after 20 feature films in forty years is a difficult task at best, particularly as public tastes change, and the character of James Bond has to maintain at least a degree of the \\'persona\\' created by Ian Fleming. While the heirs of Albert Broccoli, his daughter Barbara and son-in-law Michael G. Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series \\'fresh\\', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing \\'touch\\' with James Bond, and his world.After an astonishing pre-title sequence, climaxing with Bond being captured by the North Koreans, the film offers a horrendous montage of torture, with Bond only surviving due to a timely prisoner exchange (with an unsympathetic M remarking, \"If it had been up to me, you\\'d have stayed in North Korea...\", obviously forgetting that 007 had saved her life in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH). Pierce Brosnan, at fifty, is superb in this sequence, vulnerable yet defiant, and to this point, DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a first-class Bond entry.Then Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him, becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds, solar power, and a \\'too-good-to-be-true\\' industrialist (smarmy Toby Stephens), and all of the creativity of the opening is lost, with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly, unbelievable situations, sets and gadgets (culminating with an \\'Ice Palace\\' and an \\'invisible\\' Aston Martin).As she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY, sexy Halle Berry, 36, was publicized extensively as Bond\\'s latest leading lady, CIA agent \\'Jinx\\'. Unfortunately, after a spectacular \\'rising from the waves\\' introduction (borrowed from Ursula Andress, in DR. NO), and a few nicely choreographed fights, she spoke...and lost all of her credibility in the role. While much of the problem was certainly in the script, she was never believable as Bond\\'s \\'counterpart\\' in the American intelligence community. On the other hand, Rosamund Pike, 23, was both sexy and duplicitous as British double agent Miranda Frost, as chilly as her name, but capable of igniting under 007\\'s gaze. In a part equally poorly written, she made far more of her scenes than the writers gave her. The most interesting character in the film was certainly Rick Yune, as Graves\\' \\'enforcer\\', Zao. Charismatic, ruthless, and nearly unstoppable, Zao was nearly a primal force, far more menacing than Graves at his worst.While a sword-fight sequence between Bond and Graves provided a rare film highlight, and certainly ranks as one of the film series\\' more memorable sequences, much of the rest of the production was silly, with the story set at a break-neck pace to \\'hide\\' the absurdities. The climax, as a solar \\'ray\\' destroyed the minefield between North and South Korea, allowing an \\'invasion\\' to occur, as 007 and Jinx attempted to commandeer the aircraft controlling the \\'ray\\', stands as one of the most ludicrous finales to a Bond film since MOONRAKER.Although DIE ANOTHER DAY would become Pierce Brosnan\\'s highest-grossing Bond, to date, the film, despite heavily promoting Halle Berry\\'s presence, failed to crack the \\'Top Ten\\' box office attractions in the U.S., and disappointed many fans, worldwide.With the purchase of MGM by Sony, which has wanted to produce a Bond film for years (the studios were entangled in a legal suit that ended just as DIE began production), surprising changes were in store...CASINO ROYALE, the only Fleming title NOT owned by Eon Productions was named as the next 007 adventure...and Pierce Brosnan was FIRED (a sad finish for an actor who\\'d worked so hard to make 007 viable in the new millennium!) While Broccoli and Wilson are still \\'in charge\\' of Bond productions, they have to answer to new bosses, with definite opinions of their own on where the franchise should go...Can 007 survive THIS? We can only wait and see!\"', '\"Die Another Day creatively let the Bond phenomenon continue with full steam. With rumors of Jinx maturing into a sub-franchise I think this is the area that needs critical attention. Bond can relax until Pierce\\'s replacement must be chosen. For the quote-un-quote \\'Diehard\\' fans who aren\\'t happy with this film; I think you don\\'t have a clue about the history and ideology of Bond, or the global audience he must reach whilst remaining the Brit with wit.\"', '\"I am an action/thriller movie fan, and I thought this movie was one of the best I have seen since the Matrix and the X-men movie. It also has some humor in it too. I don\\'t remember the TV series very well, but I am interested in checking that out sometime. Good job, McG!\"', '\"A very good action movie, with some great stunts, scenes and a good soundtrack created by Hans Zimmer who also made the soundtrack for Hannibal (2000). Theres also some good actor performances by Tom Cruse, sir Anthony Hopkins etc.\"', '\"I was looking forward to seeing Bad Boys II, because my friends and on IMDb, it looked like for the most part, most people enjoyed this movie. Not to mention that due to the first Bad Boys movie caused me to have a huge crush on Will Smith. But this movie for some reason didn\\'t work that well for me, I mean, there were a few good moments that made me laugh, but this movie over all seemed kinda hateful for some reason. These two actors just didn\\'t have the light spark like Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour.Marcus and Mike start off busting a horrible KKK meeting, when a shoot out happens, Mike accidentally hits Marcus in the rear with a bullet. Marcus is just about having it with Mike, and Mike is also having a secret relationship with Marcus\\'s sister, Syd, to top that. They now have to uncover a drug and money ring that is being sent around the world through a morgue. But Marcus and Mike need to work things out since Marcus is planning on transferring the police department.Over all, Bad Boys II is a pretty decent action movie, but like I said, something rubbed me off wrong about the film. While it had great action sequences and some pretty funny moments, Will and Martin don\\'t seem to have a certain spark that other buddy cop movies have. But, it\\'s all good if others dig this movie.6/10\"', '\"I\\'m a Bond collector. I have all the movies that have arrived so far. They\\'re all well timed, good story lines and clever. Die Another Day is not like the other ones.James Bond films don\\'t involve unbelievably impossible equipment. For nerds out there, I hate to say it, but an invisible car is not thinking literal. When barely touching the car, the \"micro cams\" would smash easily.Also 007 films don\\'t involve \"new faces.\" That was the dumbest idea from any movie.I really like the other Bond films, especially the Connery ones, and Goldeneye was good. But Die Another Day just took it way to far!\"', '\"In this eagerly awaited, star-studded remake of the 60s rat-pack crime-caper of the same name, Soderbergh manages to combine his dry sense of wit, beautifully stilized camerawork and a few enjoyable performances in a very pleasant way. Admittedly, Soderbergh ignores the fact that his plot doesn\\'t really hold together at times, also the insertion of various catchy one-liners feels fabricated and forced on a few occasions, but all things considered there\\'s a lot of fun to be had here if you don\\'t take it all too seriously as some critics have. Granted, Ocean\\'s Eleven doesn\\'t tacklesocial problematics (nor did Soderbergh aim to in the first place of course)  and it certainly isn\\'t a masterpiece but it creates a very uncomplicated, laid-back vibe that is really enjoyable most of the time. This must be largely accredited to the dialogue which is very witty most of the time. The actors all seem very at ease and it is easy to sympathise with these charming crooks, a special notice goes to Versace-clad ex-casino bigshot Elliot Gould. Which leaves for a few minor mishaps which I will address briefly. First of all the character of Julia Roberts isn\\'t very essential to the plot, nor is her appearance special in any way. Therefore it\\'s a shame her storyline with George Clooney takes up so much time in the later part of the story, which concludes in an unnecessarily predictable and well rounded ending. I believe a cameo-appearance would have been more than enough and I\\'m afraid the scribes were forced to squeeze Roberts into the story. Secondly there is very little character-development or motivation for that matter. Also, no effort is taken to bring any nuance to the \\'villain\\'-character of Andy Garcia, whereas it would have been more interesting to see any redeeming traits in his personality. Garcia delivers a very unremarkable performance that won\\'t raise any eyebrows. Just don\\'t expect Ocean\\'s Eleven to change cinematic landscape for the years to come and you will be fine after two hours well spent.\"', '\"This movie is simply awesome..now, i don\\'t associate the word awesome with any movie i come across, but the story line of Ocean\\'s 11 rocks. The star cast is quite impressive and the acting is kinda fresh..loads of comedy and a lot of moments where the movie makes you think..\"How the F*** did they do that\"!! Clooney\\'s acting as Danny Ocean is quite impressive, but i think Brad Pitt was wasted as Rusty Ryan. Andy Garcia handled the role of Terry Benedict quite nicely. Now coming to the plot..Las Vegas is the gambling hot-spot of the world..and the sort of money that flows in and out of the casinos is in millions..the sort of money everyone dreams of. Eleven guys decide to rob three of the largest casinos in Las Vegas with the help of a \\'Pinch\\', a High Flying Chinese boy and yes..lots of smart talk..I won\\'t spoil your fun by telling you whether they succeed or not...this movie is definitely worth a watch. Highly recommended. 8.5/10\"', '\"this movie, unlike mission impossible 1, is bad. first of all when i see mission impossible i expect to see a twisted and creative plot, but in this movie the plot doesnÂ´t exist (the man who wrote about chimera should be executed right now). the whole movie is an excuse to show big chases, action, good-looking characters and of course lots and lots of explosions and shootings. how much money did they pay to hopkins to play something in this movie?. tom cruise is ok as ethan hunt but it seems that it\\'s more important to him to keep his hair tidy than to act, in this movie he looks like a common playboy, when he should look as a secret agent like in mission impossible 1. the girl (whatever her name is) acts terrible and she is a pain the whole movie. so is the bad guy dougray scott (how did this dumbass got casted as the co-star?) unbelievable. the only good thing about the movie are some action scenes like the plane crash at the beggining, it is the least we can expect from john woo (broken arrow, face off and lots of good chinese movies). if you look for a good movie look for the godfather, if you look for an action movie look for terminator and if you look for mission impossible watch the tv series.\"', '\"The Fast And The Furious The First Movie In The Fast And The Furious Franchise Stars Paul Walker As Brian O\\'Conner Vin Diesel As Dom A Fun Ride From Start to finish\"', '\"An enjoyable but nevertheless quite silly and average remake of the classic television show has the new John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) beating up a white racist (Christian Bale) and getting booted off of the police force. Everyone in this film is a racist - primarily the whites - and this whole idea is way too forced. The language and violence is rough, yet the film itself is quite goofy, with not many good scenes and only a few mediocre action sequences. The moral is somewhat depressing: if someone wrongs you, or someone of your race, then beat them up and kill them once they reappear. Richard Roundtree\\'s cameo helps a bit, but regardless, this SHAFT is still only \"good\" at best.2.5/5 stars.\"', '\"After watching Bad Boys 2, I had a discussion with a friend over whether or not that was indeed the worst action flick we had ever seen, putting it up against another baddie, Collateral Damage.  We decided that at least Damage was short, because Bad Boys 2 ran on for a dreadful 2 hours and 45 minutes with the onslaught of commercials and previews we saw.  How bad was Bad Boys 2?  It inflicted physical pain upon me, making me hurt in no ways a movie has honestly made me hurt.  It was just a huge cliche wrapped in innuendo sealed in really shiny film with terrible signature Bruckheimer slow mo and various other editing techniques.  At certain points, we began to question whether or not after Pirates of the Carribean, Bruckheimer decided to throw caution to the wind and try to make a film as truly horrible as he could. How shoddy was this filmmaking?  You can easily see that the money in the mortuary in which Martin Lawrence and Will Smith \"sneak\" into says \"For Motion Picture use only.\"  I went in with low, low expectations and I came out with a new feeling from a movie.  Instead of feeling robbed of money, I felt robbed of time and I wanted my precious nearly 3 hours back.  I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 in the voting only because I could not give it a 0.0 out of 10 for being the worst thing to ever happen to me\"', '\"By all accounts, this movie should have been bad.  I mean, it\\'s a Western...a COMEDIC Western, featuring a Chinese martial arts expert who arrives in the West to beat up a bunch of stupid hicks while getting advice from your atypical blonde cowboy on how to survive from the West.  At least, that\\'s what one would gather from the trailer.However, the actual movie itself has a solid plot with plenty of interesting characters thrown in.  The humor is simplistic, yet at the same time doesn\\'t go into the realm of stupid or idiotic (re: the now-defunct TV series \"Working\").  The martial arts sequences are beautifully choreographed, which is to be expected of any Chan film.  The cowboy Roy O\\'Bannon, played by Owen Wilson, is surprisingly effective as comic relief: a wannabe cowboy who is ignorant of the life itself and acts as an expert while dispensing advice on the \"cowboy life\" most likely inferred from the reading of dime ovels.I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this film.  Not exactly Oscar material, but if you\\'re really bored and with a group of friends, I heavily recommend this film.  You won\\'t be disappointed.  Out of ten stars, I gave this film a \"pleasantly surprised\" 8.\"', '\"Looks like they got carried away with showing Tom\\'s physical attributes and forgot what the \"hook\" was for this type of movie.  It\\'s supposed to be high tech-stuff and lots of it. And if you\\'re going to include women make them beautiful. Not something to target males out of the Asian under nourished community! The opening as well as a lot of the movie was slow and a waste of plot building time. When they did use gadgets it was brief and nothing memorable. Tom is getting to that age where he needs to focus more on his acting and on how his fellow actors support his characters, and not on the \"I\\'ve still got a cute behind and I sell tickets persona\". Where\\'s the non-stopping action I wish I could do, the adventures in places I\\'d like to visit and with the women I\\'d want to be with? This is the type of stuff that gives sequels a bad name.\"', '\"If you\\'ve already seen \"Men In Black\" and \"The 5th Element\" then you certainly don\\'t need to see this.

Otherwise, go for a walk and save your money.\"', '\"yes you read it right this is the very first film in the fast and furious series i have seen all of them even the new one furious 7 i am waiting for fast 8 but out of all i love this one.why i love this film is not just because i am a hardcore Vin diesel fan but because of the direction in this one by Rob Cohen this director is gold after this he made one more movie with Vin Diesel called Triple X aka xXx in year 2002 both of these films are proof that this guy is a master action director he is my favorite action film director along with John Woo.i don\\'t have to tell about all the cast you know who they are but i will mention Paul walker here it is sad that he passed away few years back but his style in this film is epic,also i got into fish sandwiches & burgers because of him seriously there is one funny scene in this film that is one of my favorite nothing beats its at the start of the film when Brian come at Dom\\'s eating place but things go wrong as he gets into the fight with Vince,the whole situation is pure hilarious with the background song called watch your back.the plot:the story of this film is very simple its about a undercover police officer Brian O Connor who infiltrates Dominic Torretoes gang because the gang is involved in stealing trucks full of expensive electronics.this film got it all right the cars the street racing & even the music,the action is slow at times but good to enjoy,this is the best one in the entire series the rest of the sequels are nowhere near to this.Rob Cohen needs a good film to direct now he is in deep mess these days.here what most i like about this film is the character of Paul walker he appears weak but watch the climax & you\\'ll see what he does he is fearless he saves the entire team of Dom from the truck driver,he overshadowed Vin diesel here a little by his performance,don\\'t know if he did all those stunts by himself but it was cool to watch him in action.some people hate this film & the entire fast & the furious series for no reason i say don\\'t listen to them or critics go buy or rent all of these film there are seven of them,if you like James bond series or Mission impossible ones or even Jason Bourne ones & if you are a action junkie like me then please pick this up without a doubt it is very entertaining & worth your time.this came out in 2001 but looks fresh the picture quality is amazing too.just don\\'t go and watch the latest ones because of the hype around them you must see this one then the rest,i know people are going crazy over furious 7 but it nice but not good as this one.Overall this film is a mix bag of comedy,romance,action & drama so my rating for The Fast & The Furious 2001 is 10/10:Recommended\"', '\"Samuel L. Jackson is here in one of his best roles ever as the black no-nonsense NYC detective John Shaft who\\'s mean, yet good-hearted and caring in his own strange and rough way; he\\'s especially kind toward the scared bar waitress, played well by Toni Collette. He didn\\'t mind being mean toward the Hispanic Peeples Hernandez, the part Jeffrey Wright played so convincingly. It was, to say the very least, extremely refreshing to see Vanessa Williams who portrayed Carmen Vasquez. Christian Bale, a very versatile actor, was the smart-aleck Walter Wade, Jr, for whom no sensible person could have any sympathy. Also, the unforgettable Richard Roundtree made a surprise, yet not-surprising, appearance as the \"original\" John Shaft, here John Shaft\\'s uncle. Naturally, Isaac Hayes\\' musical contribution was a mind-sticker. And too, it is obvious that the director John Singleton made a great accomplishment. But while it was allegedly a serious drama, because of the filthy persiflage on the part of Jackson toward Wright and a few others, I was led to laugh, and did. They did for sure get carried away there. And yet, it was a story about a serious detective who hated injustice with a passion. Samuel L. Jackson, again, made you believe here that he was \"the man who would risk his neck for fellow-man\" for sure.\"', '\"Die Another Day is an above-average movie that nearly sinks itself with poor cliches and painful escape scenes.First off, I\\'ll talk about some of the negative points of the movie. The most dreadful parts of it include the parachute-surfboard scene which was incredibly hokey and nearly ruined the whole thing. The movie also includes the most painful one-line cliche ever heard in a Bond movie, \"Saved by the bell!\" You may want to plug your ears when you get to the waterfall scene, even though you won\\'t be able to drown out the groans from the audience around you.What was up with the cloak-car, as well? Whoever came up with  such an obviously Star-Trek like gadget was out of their mind.As for Rick Yune\\'s character, couldn\\'t they have removed the diamonds from his face? It looked cool but didn\\'t make a lot of sense.Now for the more redeeming qualities of the film. These include the swordfight between Bond and Graves, which was extremely well done, and most of the first half-hour of the movie is excellent. It starts to go downhill when Halle Berry enters and the cheesy innuendos start.\\nSome of the end-scenes are almost anime-like in the way the drama unfolds. The car chase scenes are cool and I liked the way that Graves is like Bond in so many ways. They are perfect adversaries. The theme song by Madonna was so-so, but at least there were no naked sillouhettes spinning on pistols. The fire-effect was cool.Overall, it is not the best Bond film (that would go to The Living Daylights), and could have been a lot better. 6/10\"', '\"NOTE:  The original Shaft was ancient news by the time I was old enough to watch it, so this review carries none of that 70s nostalgia factor.All in all, It wasn\\'t as bad as I thought it\\'d be.  Considering the total cheese that it was remade from, I thought it was pretty good actually (notwithstanding the obligatory `It\\'s my duty to please that booty\\' lines). Shaft is an excellent marksman and Samuel L. Jackson is (as usual) still Da Man.\"', '\"When it was first announced that Ben Affleck would be assuming the role of Jack Ryan, I was utterly horrified. It\\'s difficult enough for anyone to follow Harrison Ford, much less the star of \"Pearl Harbor\" and \"Armageddon.\" And, of course, any semblance of continuity would be destroyed - we could buy Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford were the same character, but Baldwin, Ford, then Affleck? So, it was with low expectations that I approached this adaptation of one of my least favorite Tom Clancy novels - and I was pleasantly surprised. Of course Affleck is no Ford (or Baldwin, for that matter), but is surprisingly effective in this re-imagined version of a younger Jack Ryan, which still feels enough like the original character to work. And Morgan Freeman, as a reworked variation of the character previously played by James Earl Jones (though with a different character), steals every scene he\\'s in. Phil Alden Robinson\\'s direction is taut and exciting.While \"The Sum of All Fears\" doesn\\'t equal \"The Hunt for Red October\" or \"Clear and Present Danger\", it stacks up favorably against the uneven \"Patriot Games\", and is a welcome addition to the Jack Ryan film franchise.\"', '\"Charlie\\'s Angels could have easily been another Avengers or Lost in Space... And thank god it wasn\\'t. And the reason why Charlie\\'s Angels works and those films don\\'t is because this film refuses to take it\\'s self seriously. Sure it takes a while to get into, and for a short while you\\'ll be wondering if any of the plot revolves around anything other than giving the Angels the opportunity to flick their hair in slow motion, but once it gets going it\\'s a great deal of fun. First time director McG seems to have a pretty sure hand of the action sequences and some of the cinematography is beautiful... So what if it\\'s not Citizen Kane, it doesn\\'t want to be... The film looks great; the Angels (Drew, Lucy and Cameron) look great, the film even has Bill Murray so it can\\'t be all-bad. Just switch you\\'re brain off and you won\\'t be disappointed.7/10\"', '\"Nothing wrong here. Rob Cohen\\'s hyperdriven paean to illegal street racing is one of the more stylish films in recent memory and he gets some pretty good little performances from his actors, especially star-in-ascent Vin Diesel. Cohen is working as his title suggests but he also adds a bold use of color, flashy but not ostentatious editing and a sophisticated hip-hop soundtrack as a perfect compliment. As plots go, it\\'s standard fifties fare, cribbing elements of `Rebel Without A Cause\\', but with everyone involved trying to create a technically superior experience, who cares?\"', '\"It is difficult to describe how bad this movie is.Its doubly disappointing because it is just an incredibly bland overblown actioner...and not even a very good one at that. Firstly Pierce Brosnan is past his sell by date.He has still not made the character of Bond his own and plays it as a generic caricature of the Bond trademarks.Its also embarassing to see him trying to get by on boyish charm as he pushes fifty years old.I hope this is his last Bond film. Halle Berry is even worse.She fills a bikini top well enough but she cannot act and is laughable in the fight sequences.Her dialogue is delivered with a smug \"i\\'m funny aren\\'t I\" style that annoyed me. The plot is the weakest aspect of the movie.It defies credibility and ignores the laws of physics.Bond is often outlandish but this is just OTT.Watch Goldfinger or The Living Daylights and you suspend disbelief until you get home but with DAD you cringe as you watch it. The difference is that unlike the other Bond films you are laughing at Bond not with him. As has been reported elsewhere the effects are atrocious but I find it depressing to think that there are those who think that decent visuals would have saved this half baked disaster. Madonna\\'s title song is horrible although her cameo is too brief to be annoying.David Arnold has run out of ideas and should be replaced. On the plus side John Cleese is point perfect as Q,Rosamund Pike is an attractive foil for Bond ( although the twist to her character would fail to surprise a Neanderthal) and bit players like Emilio Echevarra and Rachelle Grant add some ethnic vitality to the cast. Avoid this movie.Watch one of the earlier movies on DVD instead.\"', '\"spoilers?I liked this movie.  But it has some serious flaws that may disgust some viewers.  The biggest notable item is the lack of an ending.  It\\'s like they wrote the movie and they didn\\'t know how to end it.  They kinda wrote themselves into a corner.  And it\\'s never really known why the bad guys were bad guys, or why some triads were shot or killed.  Perhaps I should say the plot is very vague.What I had problems with is again this fear of the R rating.  They even explain this in some of the making of parts on the dvd.  Their reason for wanting a PG-13 is to get the kids to watch this movie.  It\\'s really sad when the movie creators have to tone down a great movie because they want to get a certain rating.  They did that with Eyes Wide Shut so it wouldn\\'t get the so called Dreaded NC-17 rating.  Why is it that American films are so scared of pi**ing people off?  Lolita was a great hit outside this country, but was practically banned in America.  So much for that first amendment.  I think this movie would have been so much better if it didn\\'t worry about a rating.  I still like the movie, but some of the reasons behind their theories disturb me.6/10Quality: 4/10 Entertainment: 9/10 Replayable: 7/10\"', '\"The problem with \"Mission Impossible 2\" is not that the movie is absurd. The trouble is that it is unplausible. We may accept with fun the supernatural acrobacies and the preposterous technology, as we are used to do in 007 movies.But the main flaw, the unlikely behavior of the guys on the screen, cannot be swallowed. I mean: along the movie, the good guys has several opportunities to kill the bad guys, and very easily, too. Why they don\\'t just do that? Moral scruples of the good ones? When the villains are threatening the survival of the whole human species? Come on! Dead men don\\'t harm: any spy (or what else Ethan is) should fruitfully apply this axiom.Personally, I was also annoyed by the so politically correct choice of the main bad guy and bad institution: a former CIA agent and a pharmaceutical company, respectively.A little appeal: John Woo is very often called the new Sam Peckinpah. Please, don\\'t say that! Please!\"Mission Impossible 2\" has some merits. The cinematography is magnificent.The movie is (moderately) entertaining. Tom Cruise is nice and acts adequately (but, since he\\'s a beautiful man, he is commonly considered a bad actor: a little unfair cliche). Thandie Newton is gorgeous, really a splendid girl endowed with an out-of-standard beauty. The action scenes and special effects are very well made, although excessive and over-done. You know: for kids...\"', '\"While the plot of this movie is pure fiction -- a story that relies on technologies and coincidences that boggle the mind -- there actually is a self-consistency at work.  Once you buy into the basic story line (which, for your sanity, I advise doing early on), the rest of the movie flows nicely, with none of the jarring \"now what was *that* all about\" moments of the original movie.  The story centers on a doomsday virus which Ambrose has stolen and threatens to let loose on the world.  Hunt and the MI team must retrieve it; to do so, he enlists the help of master thief Nyah Nordolf-Hall (Thandie Newton) who was formerly involved with Ambrose.  Of course, Ethan and Nyah fall in love, making an oddly believable love triangle when she returns to her former lover and current nemesis.  The inevitable choreographed clashes between Tom Cruise\\'s Ethan Hunt and Dougray Scott\\'s Sean Ambrose are poetry on film. John Woo\\'s movies always intrigue me; his films are perhaps the most easily recognizable of any of today\\'s directors.\"', '\"I thought this movie had some taste to it, it was extremely hilarious.  I like Jackie Chan\\'s demeanor when he is filming his movies, the out-takes at the end are always a trip to watch.  Chan\\'s character comes to America seeking a Chinese Imperial Princess who ran away, at least thats what she thought she was doing.  He comes across an outlaw in a train robbery who plagues him while he\\'s searching for the princess.  Chan experiences a cacophony of American life when he witnesses an old fashioned gun standoff, gets married to an indian squaw and becomes friends with \"Wyatt Earp.\"Good movie, a 7 in my list.\"', '\"The series really has the feel of comic book entertainment. Not that Ian Fleming\\'s books were high art, but they were stories that played out in a believable if fantastic way. Die Another Day doesn\\'t have a lot of story; maybe 50 pages worth. There is a strong leaning towards effects in big productions, and Die Another Day has all that. So imagine 50 pages of story with lots of illustrations and you have the James Bond comic book. There are really good action segments such as the sword fight and the opening sequence, but classic Bond had more than that. Wouldn\\'t it be great if the next Bond had some real depth? Now that would be something. This one, Die Another Day, isn\\'t the worst Bond but far from the best. As entertainment I give it a 7 but as Bond its a 5.\"', '\"Although definitely not amongst the worst of the Bond franchise, Die Another Day (hereafter known as DAD) was certainly mediocre. Everything about it just seemed a tad off, from the over-criticised theme song to Halle Berry\\'s part in the film. And the technology/extreme sports. Ugh. DAD appeared to be desperately fending off xXx as the supremo in the \\'secret agent\\' world, although frankly the less they imitated from that calamity the better. Bond surfing. Twice. With cheesy CGI. The villain\\'s \\'supersuit\\' which had NO relevance WHATSOEVER with the plot apart from (spoiler) his demise. Cheesy laser CGI. The whole DNA thing. Cheesy CGI. You get the point. Nevertheless, DAD did have its good points. The opening scene in North Korea, the concept of Bond being captured was intriguing (despite groans from the die-hard fans); and the Zao  guy with diamonds in his face was far more threatening than the foppish Gustav Graves. The car chase on ice, the sword-fight in the club and Miranda Frost, all good. One gets the feeling that DAD didn\\'t know where it wanted to go. The aforementioned struggle to impersonate Vin Diesel; the overkill of homage to previous Bond films; trying to be a cutting-edge real-life political thriller; giving Bond human qualities through failure; elevating a female character, Jinx to the same level as Bond (though arguably already established in TND with Michelle Yeoh). Still, you have to give DAD its due. The acting was solid, apart from *cough*Madonna*cough the crappy little cameo that was there for...pleasing Mr Ritchie? No idea. The action scenes, though rare, equalled those in Goldeneye and the opening scene in TND. The women, excellent. A pity that the Frost character wasn\\'t fleshed out more, could have had a more interesting clash between her and Jinx. Gadgets, overkill as said before. All in all your average slapdash Bond movie, on par with TND, not as bad as TWINE but yet to surpass Goldeneye, which, let\\'s face it, was and IS going to be the last excellent Bond film. Die Another Day gets six, six and a half out of ten.\"', '\"The one that started it all, The original Fast and the Furious is a movie that I think is often forgotten. Fans and casual viewers alike think of the extremely over the top impossible action sequences the newer Furious movies have become. But few remember that once upon a time, it was about street racing and boosting trucks.While it is essentially a Point Break remake with cars instead of surfers, the Fast and the Furious manages to stand on its own and be a thoroughly entertaining movie. The dialogue is pretty stupid at times and some stuff that happens doesn\\'t always make sense, but the movie never fails to entertain.The Fast and the Furious is probably too good to be considered a guilty pleasure, but too bad to be considered a great movie, so I\\'ll just say, even if it\\'s stupid at times, and over the top, The Fast and The Furious is without a doubt a very entertaining movie I really enjoy watching every once in a while.\"', '\"From director Steven Soderbergh and an all-star cast the remake of Ocean\\'s Eleven is a rare cast of remake is considered better then the original. Ocean\\'s Eleven is a very entertaining caper film, filled with twists and turns as we see the plan unfold with both the preparation and the actual heist, centred around a strong performance by George Clooney as he got to use his trademark charm as he lead the film. All the characters have a moment to shine and they have distinctive characteristics. But the real star is Soderbergh who injects a lot of style into the film, using screen swipes, split screens, disjointed timelines and expert camera movements to transition to different scenes. There was even a great scene of flashbacks, shot in the styles of the era. Ocean Eleven\\'s is one of Soderbergh\\'s more mainstream efforts and he made a witty, entertainment heist flick. It is a film that is a great modernisation whilst still keeping a sense of 60s style cool, the clothes to the music.Yet the less we say about Don Cheadle\\'s atrocious Cockney accent the better.\"', '\"MIB2 suffered from several problems that Ghostbusters II suffered from.The first is, that by the second go-around, you have already accepted the premise. There are ghosts, and these lovable losers catch them. There are aliens amongst us, and these guys police them. Once you\\'ve accepted the premise, it just isn\\'t as funny. It just doesn\\'t seem as fantastical, and therefore, not as farcical.Another problem, both movie franchises had an animated cartoon in between movies. (The Ghostbusters cartoon was actually quite successful and ran for a season after the second movie, even though the second movie and cartoon had irreconcilable time lines.) In GBII, that meant that the ghost \"Slimer\" became a more featured character because he was such a popular character in the cartoon series (even though his presence made little or no sense in the context of the second movie.) They were appealing to the kiddie audience.The second MIB movie had the same problem. The Worms, Frank the Pug and Junkman Jeebs were all minor characters in the first film, but were popular in the cartoon series. So all got major roles in the sequel. Probably Wil Smith contributed to this, since he tried to make the sequel more \"kid friendly\" than the first. That meant the comedy wasn\\'t nearly as biting.Still, you have to like this film. Wil Smith is charming and Tommy Lee Jones is bitingly ironic. Rosario Dawson is sexy. You want to like this film, it\\'s just hard with the material.\"', '\"A big budget doesn\\'t always assure a big hit. In this case it will likely be the ticket for a block buster at the box office, but for those of us that go all the way back to Gold Finger with the Bond character we always expect more.We have learned to accept \"want to be\\'s\" as replacements for the REAL Bond, Sean Connery.  Now don\\'t get all fired up, Pierce Bronson has done some good work as his version of Bond but he seems to be fixated on the line...\"Bond,---James Bond, but again he isn\\'t the REAL thing is he?He has all the trappings of the real thing.  He has a beautiful woman, the fabulous looking Halle Berry.  I mean she looks the part of the arch-typical Bond woman, but she was not used as she should have been in this one I feel. Of course there are villains aplenty and in time we all came to despise them and cheer their ultimate demise, but they all seemed to be psychos and lacked the cold evil of other Bond Villains. There is a beautiful counter point in Rosamund Pike as \"Miranda\", but she is under used and over clothed by Bond standards.Anyway the direction, such as it is in a smash mouth explosion movie, starts off interesting and ends up slap stick. I know very little about director Lee Tamahari beyond the fact that he won some awards for commercials in New Zealand. On Directorial merit alone I hope he still has a day job back in sheep country.But this is a formula movie for me.  I paid to see beautiful women and bombs bursting and villains doing their worst and this one does that in spades.The one real delight was \"Q\" John Cleese added just the correct touch and should be \"Q\" for the next ten Bond films. Pierce Bronson may have one or two more left in him but we need to start readying for a new leaner and less long of tooth Bond. All and all a good action film, not a good Bond film but the standards are very high in that regard.\"', '\"This movie is a good example of what happens when you try to make a good \"A\"-movie with a script that has elements worthy of a good \"B\"-movie.  What happens is that you get a bad \"A\"-movie.Packed with cliches, the story can never decide whether it wants to seem plausible (happening in the \"real world\"), or fantastical (suspend disbelief) -- the result being that I never felt comfortable with the world in which the movie was set.  It often took elements of the original \\'Shaft\\' (1971), and transplanted them as-is into the current-day.  Example:  The \"It\\'s my duty to please that booty\" line -- it was funny, I laughed, but I couldn\\'t help thinking that there wasn\\'t a man on Earth that could get away with saying that to a woman in the year 2001.  1971 was thirty years ago, strides have been made.The villains:  They were well-acted, both Bale and Wright do a good job of coming off appropriately dislikeable, but they didn\\'t seem that dangerous to me.  They both seemed like rookie bad guys, who should pose no threat to a stud like Shaft.The film was also shot with many scenes occurring in the daytime, and the indoor sets were well-lit and looked new.  If there were more darkness and grunge in the movie it may have helped to promote a sense of danger and added a sinister, threatening quality that I felt was completely lacking.Samuel L. does what he can with the role.  I believe that had someone (anyone) else played Shaft, this would have been a truly terrible movie. Jackson\\'s bearing and delivery give the Shaft character credibility, but the story fails him.There are some good one-liners, but the original has better.Overall, I\\'d say it\\'s worth watching if you don\\'t have to spend any money to do so.\"', '\"Awful movie made in order to help makers of ugly body kits and rims sell their garbage to teens desperately wanting to make their economy cars go faster (see: ricers).Mind you, the fast and the furious movie IS NOT a movie for car enthusiasts. This movie is trying to PASS ITSELF as a movie for car enthusiasts, in order to extract money from teens on needless \"upgrades\" by making them believe they can become real racers (and car enthusiasts) too.---This movie has either been made: 1) By a bunch of people having no clue how cars work whatsoever (as I \\'ve seen the inside of a Mazda shown as having pistons and not rotary engine) 2) Or by a bunch of marketing guys trying to make people throw their cash away hoping to make their rusty urban car into a super car (as I \\'ve seen blatant advertising of several part makers, and trying to make the audience believe that skylines, supra s and civics with silly modifications like ugly body kits and rims are the best cars to drive around in a city*) ---Need more convincing? Here are the Lessons I learned From The fast and The furious:There is absolutely nothing wrong with installing a nitrous oxide system in a stock engine. Why someone shouldn\\'t? The only thing you have to worry about is not to burn your piston rings. Yes, these damn piston rings. You don\\'t have to worry about losing a valve, destroying the piston itself, or blowing up the engine block. Flames coming out of the exhaust all the time is good, cos, you know, it looks cool and doesn\\'t mean that the air-fuel mixture is improperly balanced and the catalytic converter will melt the next second. -When attempting to go around a corner, make sure your car slides (aka \"drifts\") to the side as much possible, 30 degrees or more, as this is the right way of driving fast.All these -so called- professional racers at WTCC, trying to keep clean lines and never slide more than 30 degrees, are pathetic losers forced to drive politically correct by their bosses. Only Vin Diesel knows how to drive really fast and like a real man. Mazda\\'s do not have rotary engines---Final Verdict: 1.3 That\\'s 1 point for the Challenger I saw in the end(it would have been a 2.4 if they hadn\\'t removed the \\'hemi\\' engine during the drag scene and put a fake air scoop), plus 0.3 for effects. This would have been a nice and fun movie, IF the makers DIDN\\'T PRETEND to be knowing about the subject it was dealing with and MADE IT AS FUNNY AS POSSIBLE. Period.Also see: Need For Speed Underground (a formerly good racing video game that replaced super cars with bummers, exotics roads with boring urban landscape, and the concept of just racing for fun with the concept of fitting loads of plastic junk to a economy car to earn \"rep\", races, magazine covers and chicks -in that order-)*I am not saying the Skyline, Supra and Civic aren\\'t good cars.

This movie left me with the feeling that two hours of my life had been stolen. OK, so this is Jack Ryan before Patriot Games (given that he\\'s unmarried ... the movie is unclear on the time when it\\'s set), so he has to be young, but Harrison Ford managed to portray Ryan as a nice guy, insecure but fundamentally smart, and Affleck just can\\'t do it. He tries hard, but is handicapped [ironically] by his good looks and boyish smile. What is even worse is that the script does Affleck no favours. . He makes a crucial phone call to someone who doesn\\'t trust him and fails to put the key information in the first sentence? That\\'s fundamentally stupid. He dashes around the world like a demented chicken rather than staying cool and making a few phone calls? And then there\\'s the plot holes: John Clark can\\'t or won\\'t speak Russian? He doesn\\'t seem to know that most Ukrainians understand Russian? Cathy gets knocked over - inside a hospital - by a nuclear blast, stays there for hours afterwards, and doesn\\'t suffer any radiation after-effects in later books? Come on, this is well beyond belief. [END SPOILER ALERT].Clancy writes well, and deserves credit for coming closer than anyone else to predicting September 11 in \"Debt of Honor\", which I read on a plane coming back from Japan :-( [END SPOILER ALERT], but watching this made me lose belief in Jack Ryan and therefore to lose interest in Clancy\\'s books. I really am tempted to sell or donate all my Clancy novels and just keep \"Every Man a Tiger\" and \"Into the Storm\", where his ability to write military tactics combines with fact.Perhaps, though, \"Sum of all Fears\" is just a blip in Clancy\\'s writing career. The following conversation took place in the men\\'s restroom after the movie:Me: \"That was bad\". Him: \"Yeah, and the air-conditioning was freezing\". Me: \"Wasn\\'t there some woman character in the book who made things really difficult for Ryan? She was totally missing from the movie\" Him: \"Oh, you\\'ve read the book?\" Me: \"Well, I started it\" Him: \"Was it boring too?\"QED.\"', '\"Low expectations but this movie rose way above them.More of the same multiplied by 100.  Waaaaaayy too long and Martin Lawrence is in it.But...theres a gunfight every fifteen minutes or so - there are two really cool car chases (the earlier freeway chase knocks the overhyped one from Matrix Reloaded into a cocked hat - whatever that is), some great use of CGI, fantastic stunts and boy when those bullets hit, they really hit (how in the hell this only got a 15 in the UK lord only knows).So there you go 2 hours and 20 minutes of inconsequential, unpretentious, ultraviolent, sweary fun.  You could do a helluva lot worse on a Saturday night.

Police driving Ferrari, on empty roads in city, haha, good joke. Don\\'t know hoe can you watch this film without thinking how stupid it is.\"', '\"WARNING: May Contain Spoilers     John Woo excels at pushing the envelope of both excitement and hyperbole in action films, but he doesn\\'t handle emotion very well. Although certain scenes in \"Mission Impossible II\" don\\'t fail to dazzle the explosion craving psyche, the entire movie has a hopelessly contrived foundation.  The characters are cliches, the plot recycled, and the dialogue is hammy as it comes.  A revelry of stuntwork, explosions and chases, but nothing more.     Tom Cruise gives his good looks, but not much else to the role of Ethan Hunt.  Whereas the original Mission Impossible contained intelligence and mystery, Cruise is forced to work within the slap-bang action hero mold. Dougray Scott is the typical insidious ex-secret agent turned renegade.  His overpunctuation of his lines is grievously apparent, and his one dimensional character practically telegraphs his direction and fate.  Thandie Newton, although extremely beautiful, is reduced to the \"hold me, hero\" love interest role for Tom Cruise.  Her character starts out as a highly capable and interesting professional thief, but degrades very quickly.  I don\\'t even know why Anthony Hopkins was in this movie, but his role was tiny enough that it doesn\\'t need to be discussed.     The plot is blatantly recycled.  A deadly virus is created and bad guys steal it, prompting a secret agent to be sent in order to get it back.  The scenes proceed in a stop/go fashion to the extreme, and hardly any tension is produced at all.  The chase scenes, though visually pleasing are predictable and rather over-the-top.  I\\'m normally not such a cynic when it comes to action movies, but couldn\\'t any idiot in his right mind have hit Cruise with at least one bullet?  The kill ratio must have been about 80-0.     On the positive side, the locations were actually quite excellent.  The opening scene with Tom Cruise in the Moab Desert, dangling from a cliff face hundreds of feet high was very striking.  Also, the Spanish flamenco and candle-lit procession scenes exhibited very impressive lighting techniques. Woo\\'s action sequences, though hideously hyperbolic at times, still display a degree of art.  In interviews, Woo has said that he retains some romantic visions in his films, such as how the motorcycle duel between Cruise and Scott mimicked a jousting competition between medieval knights.  I\\'m not about to challenge his contention, but he certainly has done better in his other films.     In sum, this movie isn\\'t bad, but it\\'s certainly not good.  Its simple plot, mega star actor, and flashy effects were enough to make it a blockbuster in 2000, but certainly not enough to make it memorable.  If you\\'re an action fan, you could give it a rent, but there are many other fine action films which are more deserving of your view.\"', '\"Long before Thirteen and Twelve, there was Ocean\\'s Eleven. A salute to Hollywood\\'s golden era where glamor and glory graced the silver screen, Eleven was a cool breathe of pure cinematic fun when it initially hit theaters during the winter of 2001. Being a remake to a forgotten Rat Pack 1960 release only added more glitter to the story Â– as director Steven Soderbergh managed to recruit some of Hollywood\\'s finest current talents to this intelligent remake. When you come to think of it, there really isn\\'t that much room for mistake when you have living-legends George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia as your main leads.If plot is of any importance to you, you\\'ll probably want to know this is about Danny Ocean (Clooney), an ex-con who just got out of a 5 year period behind bars. Determined to make a final heist before he retires from crime (yeah right), Ocean finds the perfect target Â– a casino owner named Terry Benedict (Garcia) who has his eyes out for Ocean\\'s ex, Tess (Roberts). With the help of his ten newly recruited accomplices (each individual specializes in a different field of theft), he plans the perfect crime Â– simultaneously robbing three Las Vegas casinos owned by Benedict. The suave gang of criminals soon set their plan in motion, working every little detail leading up to their final move.The slick and sly group hand out a magnificent performance as they make you realize that sometimes, in certain aspects and circumstances, crime does pay Â– and with an interest. Kudos go to Soderbergh and his gang for this one, as I truly had a ball watching it, as I\\'m sure they did making it (btw, the sequel, Ocean\\'s Twelve, is a far inferior predecessor to this film Â– but the threequel, Ocean\\'s Thirteen saves the prestige of the trilogy).\"', '\"With much anticipation, this film proved to be a downer. Sure, the creature effects and the pacing was good, but it just felt like it was old and hackneyed. Considering the story was so much similar to the first movie, it felt like we had seen this all before. Sure, the quirkiness of the movie really filled some lagging moments, but it just wasn\\'t enough. Will Smith\\'s performance was dull and uninspired, proving he has a long way to go before becoming a real actor instead of just some box office gimmick (see Tom Cruise). Tommy Lee Jones was good in the film, but that was only because his character wasn\\'t annoying like Smith\\'s faux-Chris Rock-without-the-profanity performance. Sure, the movie will make 200 million easily, but I\\'m sure more than a few people will walk away disappointed.\"', '\"Briefly - it was a load of hokum, but I really enjoyed it.

Go and see Ocean\\'s 11 soon!!\"', '\"All I can say is two-thumbs up for Tom Cruise and John Woo, they make a big difference for movies. I really admire Tom Cruise he\\'s so gifted from looks to talent. I just wonder why there are some people who hate him and getting annoyed to him. Maybe they are only envy or they are really just different. But I can say also that there are scenes in the movie that are actually impossible to happen (hence, mission: impossible) and to perform in real life. It\\'s just really a fiction and good for movies/entertainment only. Oh what the hell am I talking about. I also noticed that some people called Cruise as \\'pathetic\\', which I also does. It seems that Cruise just only want to portray his being hero in the films he stars. It does look pathetic, doesn\\'t it?\"', '\"Danny Ocean (played by Academy Award Winner George Clooney) just got out of jail. The first thing he wants to do? Rob three Las Vegas casinos: The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. All three casinos are owned by Terry Benedict (played by Academy Award Nominee Andy Garcia), who also is seeing Danny\\'s ex-wife, Tess (played by Academy Award Winner Julia Roberts). To pull off a heist like this, Danny needs the best team alive, so he brings in Frank Catton (played by the late Golden Globe Nominee Bernie Mac), Rusty Ryan (played by Academy Award Winner Brad Pitt) and Linus Caldwell (played by Academy Award Winner Matt Damon). With a crew like this, the question is this: Are you in or out?Suffice it to say, I am in! This is an entertaining film that never lets up. All the actors involved in this film are at the top of their game, and they are having a good time at this. Also rounding out the cast includes major actors like Academy Award Winner Casey Affleck and Academy Award Nominee Don Cheadle, so this is definitely one to see. Oh and I forgot to mention that it is Academy Award Winning Director Steven Soderbergh who brought THIS crew together to steal our hearts and walk away with a smile!Needless to say, a great film! Go and watch it!\"', '\"From weird slow motion scenes to a ridiculous villian to overacting from Halle berry, die another day is a generic time consuming movie that pales in comparison to the previous bond movies\"', '\"I really thought this movie was going to be awesome. This marks the 20th film and the 40th year anniversary of Bond. I was excited as ever walking into that theatre. The movie was a little more than mediocre. The beginning of the movie was just AWFUL and an insult to all Bond lovers. Bond should never be caught and tortured..... ever. Judi Dench serves only as a thorn as all she does is wine and coldly shaft Bond.... another bad thing. I liked the fact that they had a reference from the previous movies but I hated the fact that they used a plot from a PREVIOUS BOND MOVIE. I see no logic except to bore us with unoriginality. The movie theme is also ridiculous and Madonna can\\'t act that well. Halle Berry does nothing but spit out innuendos and idiotic puns..... another problem with the movie. She ALSO gets captured and your stuck with her spitting out puns on the torture table. Basically the first 40 minutes are unbearable but if you can survive that without ejecting the DVD then you can enjoy the action scenes (ignore the terrible CGI..... just have fun with it). I was glad Brosnan still had his Bond touch. He doesn\\'t look as old as people say as I think he looked good for someone of age 49. The length of the film is not too long or too short but it is just right here. Enjoy the action packed ending and the pretty cool action sequences as well as the ever enjoyable Q. Only Bond fans with a high optimistic level will like this one but I thought without a handful of problems it was good. A nice way for Brosnan to sign off as Bond. He is the Best one since Connery and its sad to see him step down but his age would have gotten to him eventually. This movie is not a complete disappointment. 6/10\"', '\"Die Another Day if the fourth and final Pierce Brosnan Bond film and is my personal least favourite Bond film. The opening sequence is actually pretty great and the duel scene is good. Unfortunately everything else is pretty bad. It was the 40th anniversary and I could feel the creators trying to go all out with this but it was too much. The invisible car and the huge action sequences with poor CGI was too much. The villain is very bad too. His change in appearance is stupid and Halle Berry\\'s Bond girl was not great. It is too bad that Brosnan had to finish with this film. For anyone who is not a Bond fan I couldn\\'t really recommend this one.4.0/10\"', '\"After many unfortunate movies, like (Wild Wild West), (Ali) and (Men in Black II), (Will Smith) needed a hit. At the same time, (Martin Lawrence) after so many wrong choices, needed also a hit (and he still does!). So why not they both return to the lucky title that brought them fame earlier. It was a comic action that proved itself as a hit in 1995. But the sequel that they made was close to a hit to our faces more than anything else!As for the action, it\\'s monstrously violent; with bursting blood, torn-off limbs, and a dictionary in profanity. As for the comedy, aside from the matter of (Lawrence) being mistakenly shot in the start, it\\'s extremely nasty. Enough to tell you that what this movie thinks as funny includes: corpses being thrown in the street, being crashed by a car, being disrobed in a morgue, and yeah.. rats having sex!! Even (Joe Pantoliano)\\'s nervousness was dull, and recycled from 100 previous movies. Add, to all of that, having an overblown plot too; with a smart evil guy, an idiot evil guy, a war between them, another war between them both and the good guys, an undercover mission, a search for the truth, and a difficult love story between (Smith) and (Lawrence)\\'s sister; which produced a TWO HOURS AND A HALF LONG MOVIE (even India stopped making movies that long!)At times, I felt that director (Micheal Bay)\\'s desire was making a buddy-action realistic epic; with so drastic violence, much - no comic - dialogue, and a scene where the men of the SWAT team are talking proudly about the powers of their motherlands (which suits a Seven Samurai kind of tale!). Sure, producing something serious out of what\\'s supposed to be funny action flick is ambitious, but this is the wrong way to do it.At other times, I felt that (Bay) wanted the biggest blockbuster ever made; with endless car chases, plenty of helicopters, and non-stop explosions. But eventually it looked like a movie with a potbelly. (Bay) should have eliminated at least half an hour. For little instance, I don\\'t know why the storyline of the Russian guy in the first place. Let alone that his blockbuster ended up as bloody popcorn, bad \"bad boys\" movie, or simply anything but a funny action flick!In a word: when you go to a movie of that kind to watch people get exploded into halves, so you must be shocked, sick, and most of all deceived. Not even (Amir M. Mokri)\\'s dazzling cinematography can make up for it. I\\'m sorry to say it, but this is not as good as the first movie; which wasn\\'t a very good movie in the first place. Next time, I\\'ll maybe watch the action sequences only. Or maybe there\\'ll be no \"next time\" originally!What ever happened to the buddy-movies lately?!\"', '\"If truth be told, I never am being a fan for the 007 films. And I never plan to be one.  It appear to me that Bond always did those typical that being a trade mark for him (against the superlative villains, get some gorgeous chick to laid, outstanding actions, cutting-edge technology etc).  It never really impressed me. It happens that I only watched ones of franchise once in the theater, `Tomorrow Never Dies\\', and that\\'s because I\\'m the big fan of Michelle Yeoh (I generally gaze at it just on TV).The same reason happens when I decide to watched `Die Another Day\\'. The only thing draws me to watch the film is Hale Berry. I always admiring beautiful and talented actress, and I wonder why Hale Berry would like to be part of this. Then I watched it, and guess what? I almost stun with what Bond did this time. It looks that Bond defy his own rule. Being captured, tortured, hurting and many more and that made him completely human. Well, I think it a good progress for his character (considering the appearance of `XXX\\' I supposed?). Lee Tamahori does know what market that he\\'s going to deal with.  Certainly, he doesn\\'t just allow the typical that the way the original tend to do by veiled this one with the latest FX,  more twisted plot and modernized characters, and that makes Bond more hip and slick than ever. It\\'s a good effort of course, considering that Bond facing of the many competitors that anxiously to beat him and the younger audiences that he must capture to make more money at the Box Office. The result is `Die Another Day\\' became the most successful Bond in the series. In general, `Die Another Day\\' is a well done action packed, but obviously we can\\'t hope more than just a total entertaining and expect nothing else.\\n6/10\"', '\"Well, if you\\'ve read the book and you\\'re expecting a representation of what Clancy wrote, you\\'re going to be disappointed.Very few details of the film matched the book.Jack Ryan was nowhere nearly developed as a person as Clancy\\'s book. The reason for most of the actions done by antagonists was completely changed. Even the role of John Clark...I\\'m disappointed that the film did not even closely parallel the book - and at the same time, not so much - because the book was long-winded and painfully slow.\"', '\"Not that I am a big fan of Clancy or his hero Jack Ryan, but after Baldwin and Ford played this character, Affleck ruined the whole Ryan persona with his usual lack of grace and gravity. The worse atrocity was replacing Muslim Arab terrorists in the novel(who could imagine that?) with a composite phony crew of Russian Nazis(uh huh, why not German Nazis or Russian Communists, the real Nazis had no great love for Slavs). This is a good example of the phonies in Hollywood trying to bury Islamic terrorism by pretending everyone but Muslims are terrorists.Other than that, the film was boring and unreal, Baltimore is leveled, yet a car crash on the local news has more depth. It was the same warmed over stuff that any procedural nuke flick like \"The Fourth Protocol\" or the \"The Peacemaker\" offered up much better. If you can see it for free, go ahead, it\\'s not horrible, but don\\'t spend a nickel or go ten feet out of your way for this one.\"', '\"This is not bad for a sequel, not as good as the first though, in fact quite a bit behind, but its still fun and entertaining, almost the same crew as last time, doing the same sort of stuff, Tommy Lee Jones is eating it up, but Will Smith is not far behind, and Rip Torn does his usual great support.Its the making of the film that is not great, there are a few errors and some idiotic stuff, as they are trying to make it either dafter or more kooky, the story is ok, but some of the scenes take a departure and don\\'t work as good, it didn\\'t have the fluidity of the first. The end song by Will is a bit poor compared to the first one.But like I said, still a lot of fun, very watchable, it would be nice if the had added out-takes at the end. But you can\\'t have everything. I give it a 6 for the quality acting and fun.\"', '\"\"Charlie\\'s Angels\" is full of crowd-pleasing action, but the film\\'s awkward mixture of parody and action-adventure elements, unpolished screenplay, gimmicky direction and not nearly enough Bill Murray make this a mediocre effort.\"The Matrix\" clearly inspired many of this film\\'s effects, fight sequences and camera moves, but the makers of \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" seem to understand them only on a technical level, unclear how to use them to enhance the mood or propel the story. The arbitrary use of slow-motion robs the fight scenes of their urgency and reminds the viewer that this is merely a stunt show, not a story about characters fighting for their lives.The preview audience seemed to enjoy this movie, although they responded best to sequences that detoured from the main story, in particular a \"Soul Train\" dance number.\"', '\"If you are looking for an \"on the edge of your seat\" movie, this is it. Ben Affleck has a role of a life time.  I only have a couple of Clancy novels left to read, and I would like to see Affleck in every one of them.  This movie is funny and action packed.  If you see one movie this year, this should be it.\"', '\"After watching MIIB, I had the feeling that the film makers thought that the orginal movie was so successful because of the special effects.  So, when making a sequel, they should just put in more special effects;  And they did.  If you thought the \"weird aliens\" were funny in the first, there are more here.  If you thought a talking dog was funny in the first, lots more of him here.  If you liked the car that is part spaceship, lots more of it here.  If you thought the alien getting his head shot off and it growing back was fun, it happens about 5 more times here.  Of course while putting in all the extra fun stuff, a few minor things like the the characters and the plot had to be squeezed out.The first movie developed a little background Smith\\'s and Jones\\' characters, and let you sense a bond between them.  No time for that here.  They were mostly just typical buddy cop characters.  Setting out to save the world, always a 1/2 step ahead of the villains. There are a couple of clever jokes, a chuckle here and there, but there was too few for the humor to save the movie, and there was too little development of the characters or the plot for me to be concerned about resolution of the story.\"', '\"Die Another Day is possibly the worst James Bond movie ever made.With that out of the way lets examine why. Pierce Brosnan seems to be going through a downhill slope of Bond scripts ever since his phenomenal Goldeneye. Don\\'t get me wrong, there\\'s nothing wrong with Brosnan himself. Halle Berry looks slightly out of place as a Bond girl due to the lack of sophistication.The first half of the movie starts off pretty well with a nice chase in Korea and a trip to Cuba as well as a great fencing sequence. However the second half of the movie all goes downhill to hell. The so called \"Dream maker\" machine looks like something you would see from a toy store. The introduction of an invisible car causes some serious cringes. By now you\\'d think they\\'d stop with this poor storytelling but the last quarter of the movie takes place in a fortress made of ice! If this movie were entitled: Action Man - The Movie, then I could probably look past these bizarre out of place elements. But as a James Bond movie these things cannot be excused.By the end of the movie and by the time you\\'re past caring about the plot anymore, there\\'s a big scene involving a mechanical suit that is used to control a satellite in outer space that uses diamonds to create a powerful laser that melts the ice in Antarctica in an attempt to kill James Bond who wind surfs off a giant wave caused by the ice that\\'s melted by the laser.

Well, it was very good.  More enjoyable than the first one.  Smith and Jones sure know how to have a good time.  If you enjoyed the first \"MIB,\" then check out \"MIIB,\" or \"MIB 2.\"\\nA+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)\"', '\"I have seen some truly horrid movies, but this takes my vote for the absolute worst of the worst. Horribly miscast, completely unbelievable, and a film simply so bad that one gasps for air in an attempt to depict just how completely bad it really is. It is so dreadful that I cannot watch the whole thing at one time but have found myself having to shut it off and change channels after 20 minutes or so, only to come back and return to disbelief at watching its horrid resumption. There is just nothing good to say about this monstrously bad film. If one tried to deliberately make a horrible movie, they could not be any more successful than this bomb.\"', '\"Liked Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Alan Bates and Ciaran Hinds. Warning ***minor spoilers*** Had trouble with Ben Affleck in the role of Ryan, some of it not his fault as he laboured from an unbelievable script and a totally laughable ending where he is negotiating with the Russian Premier against the instructions of the US President. One man saves the world again and knows it all in spite of all the intelligence around him.  Home Alone for grownups. Some of the characters were so thinly drawn as to be tissue paper, the role of the girlfriend for one who was supposedly a doctor. Just arm candy for Ryan as not one intelligent thing comes out of her mouth apart from disbelief at his job. Also would not all these people around Baltimore be suffering from nuclear burns and like - um - cancer??? This was never addressed.  And the terrorists like hung around the stadium after the event? And everything like fits together in a neat trail? 6 out of 10. Glad I did not pay to see it.\"', '\"I saw a Lenny Henry sketch a long while ago, and it had a really good spoof theme song making a joke of his character The Pope. I never knew this is the film that introduced that cool theme tune, sung by Isaac Hayes (aka Chef in South Park). Anyway, it does have some good moments with the bad language, small action sequences and a not bad villain. Samuel L. Jackson is John Shaft, the cop that isn\\'t afraid of anything or anyone, and he\\'ll stop at nothing to complete his job. Also starring Ugly Betty\\'s Vanessa Williams as Carmen Vasquez, Casino Royale\\'s Jeffrey Wright as Peoples Hernandez, American Psycho\\'s Christian Bale as Walter Wade, Jr. and a brief Pat Hingle as Hon. Dennis Bradford. Obviously the theme song is the best part, in my opinion. Good!\"', '\"\"Mission: Impossible 2\" is not in the same league with John Woo\\'s previous \"Face/Off\" or even the first installment of Mission Impossible.  It has all the glitz and glitter, A-list staff, and money to be a highly entertaining film. But it isn\\'t. The story is simplistic, unoriginal, and has plot holes and dead-ends aplenty. The acting seems even more wooden that is allowable for the genre, and the characters are two-dimensional. For an action movie, it has way too many boring, snooze zones.  Well, I was slightly entertained while I watched it, but it is immanently forgettable. And that?s a shame.\"', '\"I\\'ve quite enjoyed the first opus, but found this one disappointing, although there are some good things (and some good girls ;-) The F/x, especially for the big worm and the two-headed guy, where poor, and it hasn\\'t the fun of the first one. So... Ok, it\\'s a \"2\". There where some worst sequels, but some really better.\"', '\"Men In Black was a movie that I liked, although I am not a HUGE fan.  It was a movie that was not really open for new ideas, and did not necessarily deserve a sequel.  That being said, no movie deserves this sequel.  It is a rehash of all of the worst elements from the first film.  The writers apparently believed that the last five minutes were the best part of the first film, and they wrote a movie based on those five minutes.  There is none of the wit of the first film present in this movie.  Do yourself a favor and skip the movie because all of the best parts (if you can call them that) are in the trailer.  This film was obviously made to make money, and I\\'m sure that it will succeed.  It does not succeed, however, in entertaining the audience, but rather in ruining the memory of the first film.  I\\'d like to suggest M$B as an alternate title to this film.\"', '\". . . is the main villain of DIE ANOTHER DAY; the loose cannon son of North Korea\\'s dictator, who guns down his own father after undergoing brain and body replacement therapy to become a billion times brighter than Einstein and a dead ringer for the original Captain America? And that\\'s not the half of it. After being demoted from double oh seven down to just single oh seven, James Bond is assigned to get down and dirty with ALL the female MI6 personnel to find out which one\\'s the Mole. In between he goes through more episodes of torture, more near-death experiences, and more extended periods of captivity than Jack Bauer could fit into 24 lifetimes. Whether it\\'s Halle Berry, Madonna, or his sister Samantha, Bond plunges ahead \"throttle up\" to break the ice with surf boards, snowmobiles, hovercraft, helicopters, ice jets, cargo planes, parachutes, switchblade gliders, invisible cars, and rocket man gear. DIE ANOTHER DAY features the best sword fights of any Bond flick yet, so graduating to slingshots must be on James\\' agenda soon. Pebbles, anyone?\"', '\"Tom Clancy seemed to like it, since he was \\'Executive Producer\\', so don\\'t trash a pretty good movie because you didn\\'t like it deviating from the book...ok?This is an early Jack Ryan appearance, hence using dofferent actors. The nuclear bomb threat is believable but a bit understated in this outing...the plot however is a bit too choppy for me...That\\'s all I have to say on it...\"', '\"With Harrison Ford out, it was decided the Jack Ryan series, which had so far proved very profitable at the box office, was to be rebooted, with Ben Affleck taking over. While the film was a financial success, it proved to be far less successful than the previous films, and it\\'s telling that 11 years later, they\\'re attempting another reboot of the series.Affleck is likable, but he doesn\\'t have anything close to the presence Alec and Harrison had. He is far outclassed by costars such as Morgan Freeman, Alan Bates, James Cromwell, and taking over from Willem Dafoe, Liev Schreiber as John Clark. It\\'s interesting to note how Clark is introduced, a lone mysterious figure standing in the rain - it\\'s fair to assume Clark, a regular and very popular character in the Ryan books, was to appear in further movies.To accommodate Ben as Jack, the book has undergone an extensive change, with Jack now a young rookie analyst, yet to be married to Cathy. While the simple premise remains the same - terrorists build nuclear device from Israeli weapon left over from Yom Kippur War and use it to provoke nuclear war between US and Russia, Jack is forced to end the crisis himself by going directly to the Hot Line - one can\\'t help feeling extremely cynical about the change of villains. In the book, the main villains are Palestinians, helped by a former left-wing German terrorist, and an American Indian extremist. In the film we get....neo-Nazis. As good as Alan Bates is as the megalomaniacal fascist Austrian politician, it is difficult to take seriously the scenario.In fact, the film\\'s biggest problem is this - they are trying to present it as a more-realistic-than-usual thriller, yet at the same time, the film has cartoonish villains, and there are a great number of moments that take us out of realism and into pure fantasy.As problem-riddled as the film is, one area it does not fail at is entertaining the viewer. If one distances themselves from the previous films, the books, it is still a pretty good thriller that always keeps your attention glued to the screen. It\\'s pace goes along at a fair clip, and there are some standout sequences. The best sequence is obviously when the nuke goes off. No last minute stopping the bomb here, it does indeed go off, and it marks the point where the film changes direction, presenting us with an intense doomsday scenario that keeps worsening by the minute.Deeply flawed, but satisfying entertainment.\"', '\"Bond is dead. An evil cabal of filmmakers have finally managed to succeed where SPECTRE, Goldfinger, Scaramanga and Grace Jones all failed. But it\\'s the manner of 007\\'s demise that\\'s the real tragedy Â– his credibility killed in a car crash of a script; his cool strangled by ham-fisted editing and utterly random direction.Fade in: unoriginal pre-credits sequence, lifted straight from GoldenEye. Fade to: Madonna\\'s excruciating theme Â‘song\\'. And so it begins. Having saved the world around 20 times, Bond is now deemed useless.

Who cares about explanations, it just suits the already-flailing Â‘plot\\'. And why Cuba? Because Halle Berry looks terrific emerging from the Caribbean, that\\'s why.Cue the first of several exchanges packed with not-even-subtle-enough-to-be-double-entendres: `Hi, I\\'m Jinx Â– I\\'m hot, horny, and obviously more than just a great piece of tail.

A very good performance in what might be her breakout picture.Also, although I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, I have enjoyed both of his MI performances.  This one perhaps more than the first, solely due to the obvious influence of director John Woo.  In the first movie, Ethan Hunt was played as more intellectual and planning.  This movie, Ethan Hunt shows a purely physical side, displaying a fighting style somewhat reminiscent of the late Brandon Lee.Directed by action master John Woo, this movie is naturally studded with eye-popping stunts.  From the free-form mountain climbing in the opening credits to the astonishing motorcycle acrobatics in the climatic chase scenes, one hardly has a moment to draw a decent breath, much less get more popcorn.  A real roller coaster of a movie that, somehow, still manages a good plot line and oddly believable characters.The only possible complaint I could muster was an overuse of slow motion and stop-time photography ... but this is a very slim complaint at best.Spend the money to see this one first run, then go back when it hits the dollar theaters in a few months and enjoy it again.\"', '\"Contains spoilers.Like so many movies of the past few years, Mission 2 seemed like a movie in search of itself.  It felt like it was trying to be many things that is just quite couldn\\'t.  And more important to the detriment of the film, I kept saying things to myself during the film.  Things like, \"The fight scenes were good, but they were better in The Matrix,\"  \"The choreography of the action scenes was OK, but they were more intense in Face/Off,\"  or \"The gadgets were neat, but they were cooler in James Bond.\"  One more thing I couldn\\'t get out of my head - and don\\'t take this the wrong way - was \"How did they get Tom Cruise\\'s hair to be all silky and wavy when he flips around like that?\"  Actually, I think Cruise got paid $25 million, and his hair must\\'ve got another $5 million at least, for all the acting it did.  The movie was enjoyable, don\\'t get me wrong, but it lacked the *escapist* element.  The female lead, Thandie Newton, was terrific in her role as the thief turned spy.  And she almost had more emotion as Tom\\'s Hair.  Um, that\\'s supposed to be a compliment.  But it brings up another problem.  All the other actors seemed a bit under used.  Ving Rhames, at the time of the first movie, was on the verge of becoming a major African American film star.  What with his great performances in Pulp Fiction, Dave, and Out of Sight, you\\'d think he\\'d have a bigger role this time around.  But if anything, it was less memorable than the Hair.  (I\\'m sorry, that\\'s really the biggest thing I remember about the movie now, 5 hours after seeing it.) And where did the other member of the IMF team come from, and what was his purpose?  My point being simply that the characters were very under used. Oh!  There\\'s another thing.  The bad guy.  No, I didn\\'t have a particular problem with Dougray Scott, he was supposed to look like Cruise.  But his henchman rubbed me the wrong way.  Mr. Stamp (a bit too close to Tomorrow Never Dies\\' Mr. Stamper) couldn\\'t decide whether he was an intelligent killer, or a bad-a** thug.  I would have preferred the former, and liked to have seen Thomas Jane from Deep Blue Sea in that role.  He makes a really good brooding bad guy.  Another major part of the \"under used\" list was Anthony Hopkins.  He made a passable IMF leader, but he didn\\'t look like he was enjoying himself very much.Ok, it was worth seeing, definitely.  I just think it should have concentrated more on the action than the romance, or the other way around.One last note. As a would-be filmmaker, I had to notice the over-use of the suddenly very popular slo-mo shot.  It was just short of annoying.  Let\\'s hope for a return to more traditional film styles, instead of the \"so-different-it\\'s-cool\" motif we\\'re seeing so much of lately.  It\\'s not that I don\\'t like new and exciting, but not when it\\'s used just because it\\'s new and different.\"', '\"Bad Boys II was funny from beginning to end. It had explosions, great story line, and everything else that people like in movies. It was longer than the first, but more action and the stroy was developed very well.\"', '\"Let me start by saying I enjoyed this movie. As my summary suggests, it serves it purpose as being a mindless summer action movie for people to enjoy. Therefore I watched this in the mindset of wanting to be entertained. Not educated.And y\\'now what? I was thoroughly entertained.First of all, the plot is ClichÃ© no.4, a virus is created and has to be stopped. So nothing original so far. It does provide a basic premise that is easy for many cinemas goers can understand. It depends on your point of view whether this is a wise move or not, but as I\\'ve mentioned, people just want action from a movie such as this.The characters serve their purpose but add little depth to their motives or actions. They just seem to do things. We are given some back story into some of the characters but it is not conveyed very effectively. For example, Thandie Newton\\'s character is supposedly a thief with no conscience. This is \"effectively\" portrayed by her driving recklessly and generally pouting. But never does she try and gain advantage of her situation (like a thief would). Why not pocket a bit of that cash for yourself? The camera work and special effects are Woo trademarks in this movie. Especially in regard to the slow motion shots with unnecessary amounts of emotion thrown over like sprinkles.Overall, I would say this movie was always destined to receive the reviews it did. With similar regard to it\\'s box office totals. It was a summer movie action movie staring Tom Cruise which was a sequel of a much loved 1996 spy movie. What could you expect? This movie was never going to undercut The Godfather or Citizen Kane, but it was supposed to make a lot of money. And that it did, and probably entertained a lot of people along the way. It certainly started the 2000\\'s of to a good start in terms of action.So what the hell. Stick your mind in neutral for an hour and a half and enjoy Mission Impossible 2.\"', '\"Overall I thought that Mission Impossible II was a nice action movie. While it is true that MI2 deviates from the original TV series in that it is more of a single man doing all the work instead of a team.  But if you can overlook this part of the movie and not compare it to the series then you should enjoy this one.John Woo includes his classic cinematography, slow-mo shots, which some people claimed were overused.  I think the slow-mo added to the scenes.I also give kudos for Cruise doing his own stunts.While some of the scenes where unbelievable, rock climbing scene, and motorcycle joust scene, I can\\'t help but wonder about when movies had to be believable.I do have one last thing to say.  If Ethan Hunt could exist he would beat the tar out of Bond.I give this movie an 8 out of 10.\"', '\"I absolutely loved this movie, it was an andrenaline rush from start to finish..... by far one of the greatest. Non-Stop action that kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. Great story line too.\"', '\"Ocean\\'s Eleven was one of the worst movies I\\'ve ever seen. It was a boring movie and it put me to sleep. It made no sense and was a big waste of money. It\\'s a good movie if you feel like going to sleep.All it showed was someone trying to rob a cassino from the start to the finish. I wouldn\\'t reccomend anyone to  go see the movie. The casting was awful, along with the screenplay. I was talked into watching this movie, and I feel like shooting this person. I don\\'t know anyone who has liked this movie yet. It was pretty bad when I fall to sleep during a movie.\"', '\"End of story. Just give it up. Stupid so-called James Bond.\\nRemember when James bond films featured hotties who would get your blood boiling? Apparently, those days are long gone. This James Bond features a short-haired women with no sex appeal. If you want to see a woman with a boyish do I can probably stick my head out of my window and be wholly unimpressed.\\nThere is still some action, but the FX are cheap.\"', '\"First of all: The Fast and The Furious does not have a good story. The plot is very thin and the dialogues are terrible. Now, the question rises: is it therefore a bad movie ? The answer (for me)is NO! The main reason why this is quite a good movie is the MTV ish style in wich this movie is recorded. The style is fast, with a couple of very nice camera movements. besides that, this movie offers great cars, great action and a fine soundtrack. Therefore, this movie offers exactly what it pretends: great, non complex entertainment.So, if you are looking for a movie without a very complex storyline, but with great visuals and great entertaining value, this is the one.8.5/10,\"', '\"This movie is fun, cool, funny, twisting, exploding with style, and ineffably awesome. But I just wanna list some of my favorite quotes:\\n\"It\\'ll be nice working with proper villains again.\"\\n\"Guys, guys, look! All....reds!\"\\n\"Ten oughta do it, right? (Pause for answer that never comes) You think we need one more? (Pause for answer that never comes) You think we need one more. (Pause for answer that never comes) Alright, we\\'ll get one more.\"\\n\"They also PAINTED occasionally.\"\\n\"Does he make you laugh?\" \"He doesn\\'t make me cry.\"\"', '\"I enjoyed Die Another Day more than the previous two Bond films and almost as much as Goldeneye.Some of the stunts were a little over the top, but that\\'s to be expected in a Bond movie. The only sequence I had a little trouble accepting was Bond riding the wave generated when that huge section of ice broke off. The invisible car was cool, as was Bond\\'s glass shattering ring.The reference to other Bond films, through the old props in Q\\'s equipment room, was a nice touch.  I particularly liked when Bond picked up his binoculars and bird watching book, a clever homage to the origins of the character\\'s name.Bottom line: You\\'ll get what you\\'ve come to expect from a Bond movie. Those who like Bond movies should like this one, those who don\\'t, probably won\\'t.\"', '\"The first hour or so of Die Another Day is actually great, and the opening titles are the best yet, despite the ropey Madonna song. The scenes in North Korea, Cuba and London were well on their way to signalling this as one of the better Bond films since 1977. But the moment the action moves to Iceland it all falls apart rapidly and with indignity, with some of the most preposterous and far-fetched plot twists - even by Bond standards - and some of the most amateur special effects you\\'re ever likely to see.\\nThere\\'s one action scene that is so, so hopelessly bad - Bond surfing down a collapsing iceberg - that it\\'s worth the admission price alone just to cringe. Meanwhile Brosnan and Berry have little to do as they gallop from one completely over-the-top action sequence to another. There\\'s plenty to suggest burgeoning sci-fi ambitions, too, which is a rather worrying trend.\\nThe last time a Bond movie was this overblown (Moonraker), the producers did a volte-face with the following film (For Your Eyes Only), making it a mor e down-to-earth, gritty thriller. One can only hope the same thing happens again. Bond films cannot keep getting bigger and louder forever. A coherent and involving story, a modicum of suspense, a witty and clever script, and a Bond that has to rely upon his wits rather than gadgetry to get out of ticky situtations - none of this is present in DAD.That\\'s why the film, despite the highly promising start, ends up being such a crashing bore. But it will still make the cashtills ring, so the producers may see no reason to change, after all.\"', '\"Bad Boys 2 is basically what you\\'d expect. Everything from the original gets amped up. The story is more ridiculous and less contained. There\\'s no restraint here just pure Bay indulgence. This movie is bonkers but it knows exactly what it is and doesn\\'t pretend to be anything it\\'s not. I can respect that and I appreciate this movie more than the original for that very reason.\"', '\"If you are the brainless, easily entertained fan boy type moviegoer that Hollywood depends on these days, man is this the film for you. Only this isn\\'t a film. It\\'s 88 minutes of various ingredients that put together by filmmakers who actually give a damn about their craft might cook, but not this boring oatmeal. Imagine if someone gave you three raw eggs, some tomatoes, cheese and ham and called that an omelet. That is the nutshell of what MEN IN BLACK II is all about. To put it another way, if you can remember back to \\'97 when the original came out then you should remember that it wasn\\'t all that great either. But after a summer that started with SPEED 2, CON AIR and BATMAN & ROBIN the original was a nice diversion. If you want to see a film about humans defeating aliens intent on destroying the earth and are hellbent on paying $9 for the privilege, then see LILO & STITCH. Or at least give yourself some sort head injury.\"', '\"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen a worse movie than this.  Since when do Charlie\\'s Angels have super-powers?  There was NO plot (it was like watching a bunch of bad skits), atrocious acting and extremely annoying special effects.  Why is it that every movie fight scene has to be exactly like something like \"The Matrix?\" This movie sucks, don\\'t see it.\"', '\"After reading the review provided by IMDb, I agree with the last critic mentioned. I am a huge Bond fan, and initially, and I mean from the gun-barrel sequence, this was a different Bond movie. Using common sense, I reasoned that movies must evolve to avoid becoming stale, and parodies of themselves, so I put the \"new nuances\" aside and just watched the movie. You know what? Despite the XXX-like approach to quite a few stunts, it was pretty good. An excellent movie, a pretty good Bond movie.  Halle Berry stumbled her way through the movie-barely, and supporting cast was all right. Don\\'t be soured by the \"newness\", looking back, you can discern differences between and among all the Bonds, both movies and actors. At least the gross of the movie will support future installments-but who will be Bond......\"', '\"Fast and the Furious franchise is one of the best examples of vicarious entertainment in the movie industry. Anyone who likes action, nice cars, racing, women etc. will find enjoyment from this movie and this franchise in one way or another. This film is a basic popcorn flic. There is not deep plot or deep characters here. So people looking for those elements in this film will be disappointed. However, most people probably knew not to expect such elements from a movie like this anyway, from the title to the trailers. I knew what I was getting when I watched this. So I enjoyed this film alright.The story isn\\'t the most original. It\\'s essentially Point Break, but admittedly done better, in my opinion. The characters are not great, though the characters are not what people are looking for in this movie anyway. The film stars Brian O\\'Conner, played by Paul Walker (RIP), who is an FBI agent. Paul Walker does fine overall in the film. His character I rooted for. However, I do not by for one second that this guy is an FBI agent. Nothing about his character makes be believe he would qualify for the FBI. When he tries to sound professional, it\\'s not believable.Vin Diesel does good in the film as well. I am a fan of Vin Diesel as an actor. He is one of my favorite aspects of the film. Michelle Rodriguez is also in the film, but does not have that much to do. The side cast is fine. I did not really care for them, but I never found them annoying.The action and racing is the highlight of the film and it\\'s done well. The races are fun, and the action (mainly car chases) will have you at the edge of your seat.Overall, I enjoyed the film. It\\'s not a deep movie, but it\\'s not supposed to be. It\\'s a popcorn flick meant to appeal to guys, and especially teenage guys. That\\'s why I call it vicarious entertainment. Every guy secretly dreams about being an action hero, driving a nice car, getting all the women. So many guys secretly would envision themselves as Paul Walker or Vin Diesel\\'s character, or one of the other character in the film. That\\'s why I say this is vicarious entertainment.\"', '\"I better hurry and write this review for `Mission Impossible 2\\' because I heard it will self-destruct in 1 minute. The good news is that there is not much to say about `M.I. 2\\'. So I guess I will make it. The plot: superspy Tom Cruise must save the world from destruction by catching the bad guy from seizing a deadly virus. It is not impossible to say that you have heard this story line before! However, Director John Woo\\'s action sequences were pretty cool! I also love the catchy theme song! Oh no! Time is up! Mission accomplished! *** Average\"', '\"I loved this movie. I have seen it 5 times now and each time it gets better and better. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a great movie. Michelle Rodriguez is awesome, just as she was in Girlfight. The movie leaves you wanting more. a truly great movie !!!\"', '\"My wife and I are big fans of the original and have anxiously awaited BBII. What a waste of time!! Sure there were a few laughs and sure there were lots of stunts, but seeing this movie made me realize that the producer/director/writer don\\'t have a clue why the first movie was a success. Apparently, it was sheer dumb luck on their part.What little plot there is in BBII is absurd...invading Cuba???? Will Smith\\'s character is the over the edge bad cop, so Martin Lawrence has to work for the laughs. There is a great deal of action, but it is very mean spirited and graphic to the point of nausea.The original was a success due to the humor, the bonding of the characters and some well timed action. This movis is a miserable follow-up with little true humor, characters that constantly harp at each other, and continual action with no real point.\"', '\"Let\\'s cut to the chase. This is Brosnan\\'s best, and probably a top three for them all.Now, reasons :)\\nFilm begins with a great sequence, leading up to the best credits sequence so far. The Madonna song does fit it, it actually made it sound good (Not as a song, just in the sequence :) )First, acting. Brosnan was perfect for the role. He was inbetween the more serious Connery and the more jokey Moore. And it worked. We also saw a darker Bond.The Bond Girls did well too. Halle Berry did good as Jinx, managing to be a strong character but not lowering Bond\\'s status. Rosamund Pike also did great in a role which had less moments.Special mention must go to John Cleese, who was a vast improvement to his character in TWINE. The jokes are free flowing, and there are references to previous films all the way through.\\nThe action was a LOT better than most of the films. Bond films have a tendancy to work on the setpieces rather than the action. Not so in this one.And the car. Oh BOY the car ruled! There\\'s one gadget most of you probably wont have heard of yet. And it is great. And to double it, there\\'s TWO gadget cars!\\nSpecial effects were both good and bad. As a whole, they were outstanding. But theres a scene later in the film that looks so fake it is stupid. And the director puts slow motion to good use, but sometimes it felt as if he was just bored and wanted something to do.\\nOverall, go see the film. NOW.\"', '\"Dear Steven,Please quit putting Julia Roberts in all your movies. She\\'s not THAT great. I realize she is the most famous movie star in the world and the studios love her bankability.....but. You know better. Come on......she was not right for the Oceans 11 role.  It should have been a woman with more grace, say...Catherine Zeta Jones.  Julia is a little too rough around the edges. She plays a hooker well and a single mom of three....a street walking cinderella, if you will.I love George Clooney. You have my permission to use him in every movie you do for the rest of your life.

It was like watching some monstrous crossing between The Killer, James Bond and The Matrix. John Woo\\'s trademarks are no more a style signature, they\\'re just a cheesy, tiring mannerism. The action scenes are directly imported from The Matrix - but without the excitement of discovery they are tiring, repetitive and gratuitously violent. The fast-slow-fast rhythm of the movie is predictable and tiring. The way Thandie Newton minces all around is tiring. The Scottish accents are tiring. The all too visible ads for Bulgari and Audi are tiring. The whole thing is one big tiring plagiarism, with too much deja vu. Yawn.\"', '\"It\\'s the score this time. Not the scorers.(Soderbergh) wanted the trust of the studio?, wanted to be a big player?, wanted to fulfill his own dreams by directing Hollywood dreams first? Whatever the reason was, the man delivered. But despite being loved or successful, the popcorn movie which he made was so unfunny and spiritless. Maybe it\\'s (Soderbergh)\\'s real unconcern of the project\\'s nature coming unconsciously on the surface. Maybe that\\'s his very sense of humor. Or maybe he got a desire to insert something extra in a genre movie?!With unceasing warm colors, so smooth editing and soothing, low tone, soundtracks, the movie\\'s time managed to be anesthetic; like seeing everything through hued glass of many bottles of wines while being a bit drunk; which took a lot from the movie\\'s supposed suspense.Despite the considerable halo of coolness around the actors, I knew pretty little data about all of their characters, with no moving matters. So I couldn\\'t care less. You must notice that they don\\'t make mistakes either; the problems are always around them, not inside of them, which\\'s surely inhuman, read: boring thing to attract any attention. Plus there was no interplay between them, or anything like it. To tell you the truth, it pushed me at times to think that (Soderbergh) was intending to show us the bad affect of the contemporary modernism on the human\\'s relationships. Sometimes they\\'re like actors with so insignificant material to do while the stars\\' charm does the rest. And sometime I believed that the insignificant material was silly, and the stars\\' charm was lost, rather speechless, amongst it.It looks nice, but it doesn\\'t feel the same, since there aren\\'t that nice characters in the first place. I watched bunch of outwardly different replicants who work together for money. Well, at least the original movie, which many consider goofy in comparison, made them one band of friends who work for money, having some motives as well. Showing the whole gang scrutinizing their unspoken dreams while watching a dazzling fountain, celebrating silently their must-be-in-the-dark glory with Debussy\\'s Clair de Lune playing in the background was well expressive moment, but nothing in the world can prevent me of convincing that it would\\'ve been more deep, emotional, and long-lived with an early glance over their actual dreams.Save the idea of the lover thief who wants to get his love back and \"hit\" his rich opponent, nothing was human. I sensed a human breath in only 2 scenes (Clooney reunites with Roberts for the first time after going out of jail, and the one where Damon and Mac were bluffing Garcia). In fact, the cuteness and cleverness in them looked not present in all the rest. There were places that beg a witty line or gag, but nothing was done. And even the real *funny* gags were whether too cold, or too American to be followed.For instance, in a second viewing, I discovered that every time we get to see (Pitt), he\\'s having a snack. Is that funny? Maybe with other, real funny, situations it could\\'ve been smart touch. Because being as it is alone was poor, giving a feel that this cast was just enjoying a vacation in Vegas where they eat and hang out together while doing, and saying, nothing funny!With another cast that would\\'ve been way less interesting. However, while the stiff personality suits the character played by (Andy Garcia) to be that scary, it was unfortunate that most of the rest looked the same under the name of coolness!The absence of the A-list, star-studded, heist movie since the 60s\\'s end and the 70s\\'s start was part of the reason why this was a hit. Simply this kind was long-time missed. Plus I believe that its success opened the way during the whole 2000s for similar projects like The Italian Job (2003), Inside Man (2006), The Brothers Bloom (2008), let alone 2 (Ocean) sequels, to be made, returning the \"Hollywood\" heist to \"Hollywood\".For me, I enjoyed part of the scheme, the good image, and the nostalgic, high class, soundtrack, but none of the characters. And with this outcome, it isn\\'t a very good or finely memorable movie. It\\'s only a good one to pass the time with.Losing the interplay between the characters and their viewers is a calamity. So again, is it (Soderbergh)\\'s indifference? Is it just his dry fun? Or is it his own satire; where it becomes all about the score, taking the humanity out of its scorers as long as they do it right anyway? But even if that was the point; then this is the movie to display that, and to be an example for it in the same time too!P.S: (Brad Pitt)\\'s voice and persona were so recognizable as the SWAT team\\'s leader in the walkie-talkie. I have no idea why to blow up the movie\\'s biggest twist prematurely as easy as this?!\"', '\"this film is so hot! i\\'m not kidding! love it so much, the cars, the guys, the kisses, the one liners! its so hot!!! watch it and love itVin Disel saying \\'if you break her heart i\\'ll break your neck\\' is so cute cause he\\'s like showing a sensitive side cause he\\'s protective of his sister. i love the way Dom(Vin Diesel) is sarcastic and not going to do anything bout Vince(Matt Schulze)and Brian(Paul Walker) fighting till Letty(Michelle Rodriguez)gives him a look and instantly he\\'s in action and sorts out the fight! it\\'s cute how she\\'s the only person he\\'ll do it for!\"', '\"Three women, detectives with a mysterious boss, retrieve stolen voice-ID software, using martial arts, tech skills and sex appeal.This is not a good movie, but it is a fun, fluffy popcorn movie. The cast is incredible, the soundtrack top notch. I cannot even imagine the budget on this thing. And the inclusion of Bill Murray? That was inspiring.And then there is Tom Green. Now, I actually like Green in small doses. But he is the odd man out here. The character of \"the Chad\" just seems wrong on so many levels. He disrupts the flow of the comedy and the gratuitous outfit changes. (Oddly, despite the obvious attempt to push the \"sex appeal\" angle, I feel like this film probably has more female than male fans.)\"', '\"I actually expected this film to be even worse that it was. (You might notice my review is nearly 2 years after the film was first released.) But I watched it on one of those nights where I just felt a need for some mindless, high-quality shoot-\\'em-up action. BAD BOYS II delivers on that score. There is a highway chase scene early on, where the bad guys are driving a trailer lugging a bunch of cars on their way to a dealership. One by one, they start throwing the cars off the trailer, and the consequences are quite spectacular. The effects are convincing, lots of things explode, crash, fly into the air, etc. Later, a large boat is used as an obstacle, with even more mayhem ensuing. In the car, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith exchange witty banter to show how cool they are (or at least, Smith is). It\\'s a satisfyingly effective, exciting and expensive scene. I dare say it gives the now legendary car chase in MATRIX RELOADED a run for its money. There are some other nice action sequences (a shoot out in a Jamaican bad-guys filthy lair is amusing and stylishly shot). Michael Bay certainly has his own style. It\\'s not actually a GOOD style overall, but it\\'s unmistakable. Extremely brief scenes one after another to make exposition seem exciting. Swooping camera angles. Over the top sound mixes. It\\'s all designed to provide a treat for the senses, I guess..but it becomes a bit much. I can\\'t believe he was allowed to get away with a nearly 2.5 hour movie. This is a popcorn action flick and its most disposable, and yet just when the movie ought to be over...there\\'s a long and frankly poorly executed rescue scene in Cuba. It hasn\\'t got half the adrenelin rush that the early chase scene did. Yes, it has the biggest explosions, but it\\'s somewhat confusing and by this time, we just want it to be OVER!! Will Smith gets to cuss a lot in this movie..but otherwise it\\'s pretty much the same schtick he always gives us. Martin Lawrence\\'s character is all over the place. Is he a reluctant cop dealing with anger issues? Is he the comic relief? Is he Smith\\'s equal in the action department? Who knows and who cares. I know some people like Lawrence. Count me out of that bunch. Joe Pantoliano is wasted in a poorly written role as their captain, who gets to go on tirades about the destruction these guys cause. (Frankly, if a chase scene like the one we see ever happened in real life, it would be MAJOR, MAJOR national and international news...not just something your boss yells at you for before telling to go \"get back out there and get those guys.\" I can\\'t help but think that in the scene as shown, probably 50 people died and about 200 cars were destroyed, along with millions of dollars in property damage. But in the world of BAD BOYS II, no big whoop. The movie needed tightening up, more than anything. Let\\'s stick to the action, cut needless \"character development\" scenes, which Michael Bay couldn\\'t pull off convincingly if his life depended on it (you can tell he doesn\\'t care about them), and confine Lawrence and Smith to the humorous banter and stay away from the loud, senseless, repetitive arguments.\"', '\"It took me a long time to get around to renting this movie. I\\'m not a big fan of most of the cast, except for Bill Murray, who was the reason I finally broke down. After seeing the movie, I have to say the casting was right on! It shouldn\\'t surprise me that women gave this movie a higher rating than men. My ex-wife loved the TV series but I could only watch it if I wore a Walkman to drown out the sound! I especially loved the sex appeal aspect... it\\'s supposed to be cute and fun and it was! Special effects were well done. The story was well done but was overshadowed by the beauty of the female form. Very nicely done!\"', '\"Worry not.  Ben Affleck does a wonderful job as a wet-behind-the-ears-soon-to-be-transformed-into-a-save-the-world-hero. The pacing is good in this film, the script and direction terse and right on key.  The supporting cast starting with Morgan Freeman is first rate. It\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve seen an action film that is as rewarding as this one.  The only negative comment I would make is that casting Ben Affleck as an unmarried Jack Ryan would naturally make you assume that this film is a prequel to the Harrison Ford pair.  However, it is set in current day which is necessary given the climate between Russia and the US the film establishes, but nonetheless jarring.  Although I remained conscious of this throughout the film, it did not really detract from the satisfying feeling this film affords.\"', '\"The best way to sum this sequel is as a \"Will Smith\" fantasy. It\\'s nowhere near as good as the original. In retrospect, it\\'s quite woke and that really ruins what could have been a good movie.Here are some flaws. Will Smith must have a fragile ego because many of the other actors that play beside him are dumbed right down to the point of being insulting. Agent T is absolutely pathetic and not even remotely funny. On the contrary, Michael Jackson (who stars as agent M) actually had an excellent sense of humour. Will Smith walks around most of the movie with a huge chip on his shoulder and a massive superiority complex, except when Tommy Lee Jones is on the screen. Jones probably said \"slick... take your inferiority complex elsewhere ... maybe to someone else\\'s scene\".It\\'s still worth a watch. There are a few funny gags and the story somewhat feels like a Men In Black. Also, it\\'s far better than MIB 2020 which is a dumpster fire.\"', '\"I found this movie very compelling and unpredictable.  The action was great and I give John Woo a very respectable nod for his work.For those who say this movie does not rate well... Did you go to this film to insult the quality of John Woo\\'s work?  Typical ignorance. I rated this movie quite highly...I would go see it again.\"', '\"Mild spoilers aheadI put this movie on once because there wasn\\'t anything else to watch (plus, it got a recommendation in Hot Fuzz, which I loved). I didn\\'t look at the running time, figuring \"It\\'s only going to be an hour and a half, how bad could it be?\" Well, stuff blows up real good and cars smash into things. That\\'s about the only thing this movie has going for it. Otherwise, the plot is clichÃ©d, the characters irritating (it\\'s not a good sign when you root for Klansmen to kill your protagonists), and the dialog makes you anxious to get back to the action. Even the action is annoying in that it is frequently filmed in the post-MTV shakycam with too many cuts.Final verdict? I heard this movie sucked, and I was not pleasantly surprised.\"', '\"To go in and watch The Fast and Furious, it is a lesson in expectations as it is obviously not a masterpiece, and you should not expect it to be either. it does exactly what it says on the poster though and the film is fast and the action is furious.The story of Brian O\\'Conner (Paul Walker) who is a undercover police officer. Trying to breaking on to the Street racing scene. Through Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) so he can bring down a crew who are hijacking trucks. The thing with the film is that in a lot of ways it is terrible. I\\'m not a Rob Cohen fan, of all his films this is probably the best of his work in my opinion and only challenged by 1996\\'s Dragonheart. In acting terms Paul Walker is a good looking guy but lacks real acting talent and charisma on screen. Vin Diesel though does have good screen presence, and at times I think is an underrated actor. The supporting cast is generally OK except for the insufferable and thankfully only in it for a short period Ja Rule, and the definitely not very intimidating Reggie Lee as the main protagonists henchmen.What is surprising and actually good about the film is that it does have a nice simple plot and develops the characters as we get to know about Dom\\'s father and his childhood, and see Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) and Brian fall in love. The Car chases are decent and again are practical effects, which are better than CGI Green screen chases uses in some of the sequels. Praise also has to made of the final sequences involving the final hijacking, the chasing of some drive by shooters and the final race off. which were very thrilling and kept you on the edge of your seat until the end.I can\\'t say i love this film, because i don\\'t. But i did like it and enjoyed the ride while it lasted.\"', '\"Here is a summer film that shows that big budget summer action films can be fun again. They don\\'t need to be about another boring battle with a world-threatening natural disaster that is always heroically defeated with a last second decision in the end. In the past few years, we have learned that humans are real heroes. Thank God those movies are long gone. It\\'s time to get back to basics. \"Shaft\" has all the fun basics.John Shaft is one smooth mother! I don\\'t really think so, but that\\'s what the movie tells us. He\\'s got a big case to take care of. Walter Williams, the son of a well known rich businessman, has just been accused of a racist murder. Williams is played by Christian Bale who was so awesome in \"American Psycho.\" He is awesome here again. In fact, one of the main reasons I went to see this movie was because of Christian Bale. It paid off. Anyway, Williams first mocks a young African-American with a series of racial, but funny remarks. When the young man responds in his own way and embarrasses Williams in front of everyone in the club, he makes a mistake. An enraged Williams murders the young man outside the club in the most brutal and casual way. He then threatens a witness (Toni Collette) as if it was no big deal. Shaft comes in to arrest Williams and throw him in jail. However, he soon realizes that the young man has too much money and power to be put away that easily. Frustrated with the law, Shaft quits the police force and decides to take care of this matter as a vigilante. With the help of his old friend Carmen (Vanessa Williams), who is still a member of the NYPD, Shaft searches for the important witness and other significant clues. Along the way he manages to get crooked cops and a drug dealer named Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright) involved in the plot.The situation eventually becomes way to complicated for just one murder by one man, but everyone wants to double-cross or use someone in some way. Samuel L. Jackson is really not that smooth as Shaft. He is annoying, like when he hits my man Christian Bale or like when he calls people f*****s for no reason. He also possesses a surprisingly short temper. He gets very upset over stupid things way too quickly. That\\'s not cool Shaft! Christian Bale is the man though. He manages to be both scary and funny, while being stylish at the same time. His racist jokes are pretty funny and I don\\'t like them because I am racist, but because they are good. He has some conversations that are both chilling and humorous with Peoples. Peoples is another fun and interesting character in the movie. He appears innocent at first, but turns out to be a deadly and dangerous criminal. One of the funny scenes occurs in jail where Peoples and Williams first meet. Williams beats up a guy twice his size because the guy wanted his shoes. As he kicks him in the face he yells \"You want my shoes!?\" He manages to maintain his slick and fearless style throughout the scene. At another time, he shows up in a ghetto neighborhood wearing nothing but Abercrombe & Fitch. Now that is funny. The guy should be killed, but he\\'s not afraid. I just hope he won\\'t become typecast as villains from now on. He\\'s too cool and he\\'s my new hero. He is \"the man\" in this movie.\"Shaft\" is too much of a blend of comedy and action to be taken seriously. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn\\'t. John Singleton does a good job of making a fun film, but it is never an overly impressive effort. And I don\\'t think it really is very true to the \"Shaft\" franchise. Although I\\'m not that familiar with the older \"Shaft\" movies, I can tell that this one is not that smooth. Samuel L. Jackson fits the role, but he is certainly not the best part of this film. The bottom line is that this film could be cooler and better, but it contains plenty of fun elements that make it worth seeing. Watch out for Christian Bale. This is a strong satisfactory summer flick. Overall, a 7 out of 10.\"', '\"Ocean\\'s Eleven sets out to be an engaging, thrilling yet fun heist movie, and it manages to accomplish just that. It\\'s stunning, it\\'s simple, it\\'s brilliant. Everything about the movie, from the pacing to the acting and dialogue, is done with so much thought and so well.Ocean\\'s Eleven has quite the typical heist film plot. A criminal, Danny Ocean (played by George Clooney) plans to pull off possibly the biggest heist in the history of the United States, planning to rob $160 million from three casinos in one night. It\\'s no easy task, and he seeks out a team of people (eleven, to be exact), of which include great actors such as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Carl Reiner.I think it\\'s easily the acting that makes this heist film such a standout from other similar films. Matt Damon is so innocent and yet so powerful, and Carl Reiner plays Saul very well, but for me the two best actors had to be George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Together their characters Danny and Rusty lead the team in real style, right from the get-go. Clooney plays his character stunningly, honestly yet with plenty of fun injected into it. Brad Pitt shines in his role, just so...amazing. The highlight of his character for me was easily when he casually got Basher out of an arrest. The dialogue in this movie couples itself perfectly with the acting. It\\'s just such witty, fun dialogue. It\\'s the type of dialogue many may cringe at, but if you\\'re watching this movie you\\'ve got to remember that it\\'s just trying to have fun. Everything from the content, the timing, the delivery of the lines, is done so well.Personally, and rather obviously, the highlight of the film had to be the heist. The movie doesn\\'t waste time getting to the heist like other heist films (I\\'m looking at you Fast Five...which actually copied an awful lot from this movie), and once it gets to the heist it doesn\\'t muck around. It just rolls with it, and it has plenty of witty fun along the way. The heist itself is clever, it\\'s smart, it\\'s brilliantly thought out by the characters and more importantly the writers of the movie.My two only gripes are rather minor; the ending and Basher\\'s accent. I\\'m not even British but the cockney accent that Don Cheadele puts on can\\'t possibly fool anyone; it\\'s just so unnecessary and whoever suggested he use one should be fired. Also, I don\\'t want to spoil the ending but I feel it could have gone just a little further. It\\'s still great, it\\'s just that it could have been perhaps more satisfying. Still, that\\'s why there are sequels.Ocean\\'s Eleven is just such a clever and yet heist film. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a thriller or is just looking for a quick way to kill two hours. You won\\'t regret it.\"', '\"Rather than go on about why I think this movie is not only terrible, but also reflective of a deep American moral failing, these quotes by Sean Burns of the Philadelphia Weekly sum up what I think is the best reaction to the film: \"Are these people out of their f**king minds? It hasn\\'t even been nine months since the most devastating civilian massacre in our nation\\'s history, and Hollywood has the balls to choose four days after Memorial Day to release a stupid popcorn crowd-pleaser about an even more horrific terrorist attack.... It\\'s hard to describe just how dirty and sickened The Sum of All Fears made me feel. Has this sort of tragedy already become fodder for senseless entertainment? Is it really okay to kill off 200,000 innocent people in the middle of a silly action picture and then try to leave us cheering at the end? I understand the film was already in production when the WTC slaughter occurred, but was it really too late to ask for a rewrite?It\\'s downright impossible to watch the chaos and destruction of the film\\'s Super Bowl sequence without terrible memories of last fall flooding back to the surface--all sorts of horrific associations and dark feelings the film has not earned.\"Obviously, even an event the magnitude of September 11 wasn\\'t enough to effect any sort of change in Hollywood. This movie exemplifies that.\"', '\"THE SUM OF ALL FEARS may be 10 years old not but it packs a wallop no matter how many times it is viewed. Credit the particular genius of Tom Clancy and his memorable creation of the main character in these suspense/espionage thrillers for that, but at the same time much credit is due screenwriters Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne for the tense dialogue and DiRector Phil Alden Robinson for the pacing of this story. As far as the story is concerned, very briefly the essence can be summarized as follows: When the president of Russia suddenly dies, a man whose politics are virtually unknown succeeds him. The change in political leaders sparks paranoia among American CIA officials, so CIA director Bill Cabot recruits a young analyst to supply insight and advice on the situation. Then the unthinkable happens: a nuclear bomb explodes in a U.S. city, and America is quick to blame the Russians.Jack Ryan was a role that seemed to belong to Harrison Ford in the other Clancy films, but here that role is assumed very well indeed by Ben Affleck. He is capably assisted by Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Bruce McGill, Liev Schreiber and Philip Baker Hall along with a large cast of supporting actors. They give it their all and make this film work on every level. For solid entertainment this is a film that deserves repeated visits. Grady Harp\"', '\"The plot was incoherent, and major \"surprises\" were telegraphed from miles away.  If you just want to see mindless violence you may enjoy some parts of this movie, but the most fun to be had from watching it is laughing at how bad it is.\"', '\"John Woo has made a terrific film with MI2. The action is an adrenaline-pumping, high octane thrill ride.  It\\'s worth seeing just for the last fifteen minutes alone.  Woo choreographs his action sequences so that they have the fell of a finely tuned ballet of violence.  The man is the master of his genre.The film itself is also quite good.  Cruise does a wonderful job as Ethan Hunt and the girl is very good too.  The plot is quite obviously secondary to the masterful action of the film, but it holds together well on its own.If you suspend disbelief and go into this movie with an open mind, you are certainly in for a very fun ride.\"', '\"I love action movies, so having seen the Bad Boys trailer, I was really looking forward to it. Plenty of stuff blows up in the film, and the car chase scene was perhaps the best I\\'ve ever seen. Wow! Lots of cars tumbling. And I was particularly impressed by Joe Pantaliano, who transforms the everyday angry police chief into something more interesting.Unfortunately, all the jokes fall flat. Martin Lawrence comes across as annoying, Will Smith steals all the scenes (don\\'t both cops get to do something useful?), and there\\'s some silly \"joke\" violence regarding death that didn\\'t work for me. They even reuse the pool joke twice. Characters do things in the film that don\\'t quite make sense. The subplot with the Russian character is wasted. Will Smith is too cool so he doesn\\'t get \"unsettled and bothered\" the way a straight man is supposed to. And they don\\'t use the party music during the action scenes like in the promo; they use it during the quiet scenes. Who made that decision?Who should see this film:-- Action junkies, but only on a rainy day-- Angry police chiefs who instead of yanking the badges from the renegade officers who have crossed the line, offer full support.-- Nobody else, even if you think you might want toSo... action varies greatly from OK to great, but plot and everything else either bad or nothing special. I\\'ll give Bad Boys II a disappointing 6 out of 10.\"', '\"This movie was great. I just saw it, and my first thought at the end of the movie was,\"I can not wait to see this again, and see it\\'s sequel,\"Mission: Impossible 3. Director John Woo did a good job making this film, and Tom Cruise and all the other actors did a good job acting. However, it wasn\\'t a huge smash like the very first Mission: Impossible in 1996. Mission: Impossible 2 didn\\'t really do that. The director of Mission: Impossible 2, John Woo could have made this movie a little exciting, and everyone would probably higher their ratings on Mission: Impossible 2. This movie was still good, had enough violence, explanation, and fun in it to be awesome. I personally think that all those movie critics should have given Mission: Impossible 2 a higher rating. Mission: Impossible 2 is worthy of more. It is awesome. Every single Mission Impossible is good, and will always be a classic. I can\\'t wait to see the sequel, \"Mission: Impossible 3, and get the movie on DVD. I hope you will enjoy this movie too.\"', '\"Back in \\'95, Michael Bay still had checks and balances in place. It\\'s why I enjoyed Bad Boys. His \"Bayisms\" were kept to a minimum, and the movie ran on the Smith/Lawrence chemistry, macho gun battles and slick polish. The Mark Mancina score added loads to the film, and it was pretty funny.Bad Boys II tosses out all of that. Everything is ramped to 11, including the camerawork, hateful dialogue and coked-fueled editing. This is a testament to a director whose id is fully in charge, and this saps all of the humor, fun and entertainment value.It is exhausting.\"', '\"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe story is sleek, smart, and complex. The plot is delivered in a fluid and comprehensible way. All in all, the story is fun, intelligent and at times funny.The characters are all very likeable. The acting is very good. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, and Matt Damon all do a great job. Julia Roberts performs the worst.The pacing is fast and the tone light yet exciting. The runtime is a little overlong and there are a few plot holes.Pros: Smart and intelligent story, good mix of humor, great acting, likeable characters, fast pacing, and a light yet exciting tone.Cons: Julia Roberts and her bad acting, an overlong runtime, and some plot holes.Overall Rating: 8.3P.S.

With one of the boys\\' sister undercover in the operation, they must act quick until she gets into more trouble than she already is.This movie follows the same footsteps as the first one, only with even more flamboyance, explosions and action. It also makes you laugh out loud multiple times but not at its predecessor\\'s level, while compensating through intense action.

Anyway, shallow action movies, full of gratuitous violence, overdone explosions and tasteless one-liners is exactly my kind of entertainment. Usually. But in this case, it didn\\'t work, it didn\\'t entertain, it was just a series of graphical highlights with not much to connect them.Maybe it a less than brilliant idea to re-do a Black version of Miami Vice in the 2000s, applying a thick layer of stereotypes and string together an endless series of scenes targeted at the tastes of a similarly stereotypical Black demographic or whatever the director assumes about them.Expect the full range of action flick stereotypes: heroes with a lifestyle light years above the average income of any real policeman, policemen driving Ferraris on duty, policemen immune to bullets, policemen that can do everything, everywhere, in record time. Then lace it with stereotypical Black stereotypes and you\\'re set: have them kill a few KKK members, let them wear Basketball shirts all the time, focus on every girl\\'s booty and have some minutes of screen time for literal truckloads of money.In short: the classic ingredients of any run-of-the-mill rap video, just extended for what feels like 2 hours and then some.\"', '\"Spoilers!! I can scarcely describe how terribly poor and disappointing is Men in Black II. The actors should be extremely ashamed for having toured every talk show to promote such waste of otherwise impressive talent. The film seemed to be have been written to entertain four year olds as it contained ridiculous slapstick and endless loopholes that were extremely irritating and made the audience not only wish for a refund but to be generously monetarily compensated for being witness to worst film since Scooby Doo.\\nAs irritating as the lack of humor were the scenes that made little if no sense. Among others were: 1.\\tThe video from the low budget science show. How did they get the story? And why didn\\'t Agent K. get the original file that the video was based on to read, instead of relying on a low budget reproduction. 2.\\tThe size of the space ship. The ship that the evil medusa alien used was quite large in the video rendition and in Agent K\\'s memory, yet when it crash landed, it was four inches high. 3.\\tThe deneuralizer/Blue Flush. These scenes made completely no sense. The aliens were allowed access to top secret information, the terminal was on the same circuit breaker as the deneuralizer, the reason for the blue flush was not explained, why it flushed them past everybody and ended up on the streets New York-so much for top security. And why the device could bring back memory from Agent J\\'s  neuralizer but not Agent K\\'s.4.\\tGet a gun and Shoot. Why could the bad red-haired alien have so much hate for Agent J, insomuch that he was willing to build or procure two ships for free just have the chance to kill him, and then just fly around with his little clone ships to smack J in the face when he could have taken care of him with one bullet.? Also-with so many powerful guns around, why didn\\'t Agents J and K use the big one to begin with instead of letting the medusa get away so often? Anyhow, the entire film was crap and the more I think about how pitifully unrealistic it was and unfunny and unentertaining, the angrier I get. 1/10\"', '\"I believe this to be the worst Bond yet.

Maybe the actors are not the best but they are suitable for the characters. This movie is not about telling a story, is about values and friendship, knowing who we are and what are we willing to lose for those values.The fast and the furious is not an usual action movie, not like \"2 fast 2 furious\", the second part of this one, that is actually the most crappy movie i could ever expect after watching the previous part. Maybe all the bad of \"2 fast 2 furious\" has been attached(unjustly) to the first part.Also a lot of races and speed with tuning cars. I highly recommend this movie for tuning lovers.\"', '\"This is by far the worst film in the series. There is barely any story that is of worth at all. The acting is also at its worst in the series. The only decent actor once again is Cruise but even then it was still a little bit of a mess. I don\\'t really know what the people were thinking when this film was made. Each of the battles were rushed and not that interesting at all. The only part of the movie I really liked is the part in the start when Cruise goes up that mountain. Everything after the first ten minutes were just uninspired.\"', '\"This movie is definitely my favourite movie of all time. The actors chosen for the roles of Danny Ocean, Rusty Ryan and all the other members were so perfectly chosen, i can\\'t imagine any other actors for their roles.This movie will never get too old for me too watch.My reason this movie stuck out to me is the actors did a great job acting as someone that was actually pulling a job, usually these movies are unrealistic about the crews confidence when in real life they would be sweating bullets. The music also gave it a very nice touch.I\\'m actually going to go watch the movie now.\"', '\"This movie was sleek, cool and highly entertaining. George Clooney really shines in one of the first big screen roles I think he was really made for. The supporting cast is also excellent. You don\\'t get to know many of them terribly well but they really do manage to stand out just the same. My only complaint would be with Matt Damon\\'s character whose story you never really get to know. Other than that I highly recommend this film.\"', '\"Now, I\\'m not saying M:I2 was bad.  I\\'m not saying it was good, either.  I\\'m just saying that it was really friggin\\' cool to see Tom Cruise do a slow-motion cartwheel kick on Dougray Scott\\'s ugly mug.  Now, if you wanna see action this summer, go see Gladiator.  If you wanna see special effects, go see Titan, A.E. or X-Men.  M:I2 runs the middle line--a fair amount of action, and decent-enough special effects... but this is friggin\\' Diet John Woo here.  Watch something of his WITHOUT all the kind, sugar-coated PG-13 censoring, and you get films that exude raw power from every sweat-soaked pore.  Believe me, \"The Killer\" makes this movie look like \"Elmo in Grouchland.\"  Not-half-bad state or no, grab a bunch of friends and see this movie, in a theater with a big screen and good sound.  If you\\'re the action hound I am, you\\'ll be satisfied... just not filled.\"', '\"Mission Impossible 2 is by far the best pure action sequel to come out in many years. What makes M:I-2 so good is are the action sequences which couldn\\'t be possible without the excellent direction of John Woo. Woo makes the most out of every scene, trying to squeeze every possible inch out of each scene. Tom Cruise puts on a good performance as IMF agent Ethan Hunt. Ving Rhames in top notch as Luther Stickell. Rhames surprisingly gets the best lines in the movie. Thandie Newton is also very enticing as Cruises partner and love interest. But the main acting asset of this film is Dougray Scott as the main villain Sean Ambroce. Scott\\'s performance is interesting and riveting. Surprisingly M:I-2 has a pretty decent plot which never gets slow or uninteresting. So if your looking for a pure adrenaline rush or a top notch thriller see Mission Impossible 2. 9/10 Excellent Thriller\"', '\"This exciting movie was easiliy  far better that the orignal, Indeed better than any of the heist films released this year (2001).Only the most basic plot elements remain from the original movie, main characters name, etc. I think that was the right route to go as no one really wanted to see a second rate re-hash of the rat pack. George Clooney leads the all star cast, much to its credit the stars aren\\'t as important as the movie, that is another great argumant for an ensemble Oscar becuase as good as they are no single actor carries the entire film.The film opens with geoge clooneys danny ocean getting his five minutes before a parole board, in probably the most sedate scene in the entire film. the rest of the film picks up the pace quite a bit and only slows down again for clooneys confrontation with his with his ex-wife, played of course by Julia, who is also of course very much still in love with her ex even if she doesn\\'t know it yet, it\\'s very formulaic and probably the weakest part of the movie. The Movies is at it\\'s best when it focuses it\\'s energy on the heist and it\\'s perpetrators the titualar 11. Also making a strong performance is Andy Garcia as the ice cold Terry Benedict, or the machine as he is fondly called in the film. I\\'ve deliberately avoided speaking about the details becuase the film is in the details and should be experienced to be believed. in conclusion another strong effort by new hollywood wunderkind Steven Soderburgh, who has a profound talent for caoxing the best out of his actors. that combined with his strong visual style makes Oceans 11 one of the best of this year. Though people who enjoyed the orignal probably won\\'t be as entertained as those who didn\\'t.\"', '\"Men In Black was a well-made and hilarious comedy that truly deserved its blockbuster status. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith had great chemistry on screen and the duo provided numerous laughs. Due to the movieÂ´s huge success a sequel was guaranteed and last year MIIB came out. I didnÂ´t see it in a theatre since I believed the reviews I read were correct. I decided to wait until the movie comes out on DVD and IÂ´m glad I did because MIIB is quite disappointing, considering all the talent involved.The best thing about MIIB is naturally the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. They are one of those great buddy pairs of cinema. Both Jones and Smith are talented actors with great comic timing. The reason why MIIB fails is its script. It does have its share of laughs, but you canÂ´t help but feel a bit cheated after watching this movie. The only reason why this movie was made was money, the studio simply wanted to cash in. Since this is movie business itÂ´s okay, but for GodÂ´s sake, they should written a lot better screenplay! MIIB has a very short running time which reveals the fact that the writers didnÂ´t have that many good ideas to work with.MIIB is a typical disposable item from Hollywood and a good example of sequels meant purely to cash in. Entertaining? Mildly. Memorable? Far from that. Worth renting? Judge for yourself.\"', '\"Brosnan is one of my family\\'s favourites as Bond and I think he does a good job of it. Goldeneye in my opinion is his best one because I loved the plot, the locations, the Bond girls and it was fun and felt more rooted down to earth.Die Another Day (DAD) feels like like a cross between a Science Fiction Matrix that somehow found its way to a Bond film. Brosnan feels quite flat in his role along with a plot that seems quite far fetched with so many things happening it is a bit mind boggling. I won\\'t get into it since everyone probably already knows what it is about but the things that happen. An invisible car, riding a tidal wave, an ice sculpted hotel/palace in Iceland (it doesn\\'t know that much there? not to mention Halle Berry who looks fantastic but doesn\\'t add much to the Bond Girl. I think she has too much star power to really make her a Bond Girl and hence it should have gone to a lesser known actress.And the lines feel so corny and clichÃ©. \\'I am Mr Kill\\' - \\'There\\'s a name to die for.\\' And some of the shots with slo-mo and almost Matrix like shots as well. This is James Bond not the Matrix! I think they tried to add to much in to make it seem cool and unique but it isn\\'t necessary to have this.Then you have the whole face transformation thing. Won\\'t mention anything else here but that was just a bit ummm.....stupid? So yes this is definitely the weakest Bond film from Brosnan. It is still watchable but so much disbelief has to be suspended in this. Yes I\\'m aware we are talking about Bond but when you start thinking they took something from science fiction, then no one can blame you.\"', '\"I was quite impressed with the first Mission Impossible. I half-expected a dumb Hollywood remake with some obscure references to a TV show I have never seen, but what I got was a semi-intelligent entertaining and spy movie with quite a few twists and surprises.I was actually quite eager to see the sequel. When I heard John Woo was directing MI2, I thought - great, instead of a good spy/action movie I will get a slow-mo fest with car wrecks and pigeons. Was I right? Unfortunately, one hundred percent.MI2 looks and feels like a 2-hour recording of a video game. Pretty people (people in question mainly being Cruise and his love interest) run, drive, shoot and generally do acrobatic things, almost half the time in slow motion. There is a generic action movie plot (villain steals thing X to do a dastardly thing Y and our hero has to stop him while THE CLOCK IS TICKING) right out of a B-action movie starring Steven Seagal or Michael Dudikoff, or an episode of Action Man cartoon series. No real team-based action, no spy angle, nothing. Just Cruise selling his hairspray commercial smile before doing some acrobatic stunt which should kill an average men ten times over.The flick really goes for the lowest possible denominator. No effort is spent into putting some logic or thought into the plot. The \"rubber mask\" shtick is so overused it is painful to watch. The action scenes never end, bullets, crashes and explosions are non-stop, yet the main characters never even get bruised. I could proceed but you get the point - this is a dumb formulaic action movie that uses every clichÃ© in the book and isn\\'t even entertaining.John Woo is a director with one trick up his sleeve and is seriously overusing his welcome. Tom Cruise obviously just wants us to watch his pretty face. Together they created a movie that is hardly worth seeing it for free, let alone paying for it.3/10\"', '\"I liked the opening scene, the familiar James Bond music.  I also loved the panoramic view at the very end of the music taken from a helicopter.  Both needed no special effects.  But besides that, I found the movie so boring I was thinking about the ten bucks I spent to see it.  This movie would be excellent if you had the mind of a ten-year-old kid, but personally, for me, I actually laughed at the special effects and nearly hooted at the invisible car.  Then I felt angry that this was going to be the highlight of the movie.  Halle Berry\\'s body looked good, I must admit that.  I wanted to see the magic of Roger Moore and Sean Connery\\'s movies -- but none did I see.  I also found it insulting how M treated James Bond.  He\\'s a secret agent for years and years and she looks at him as if he\\'s an idiot?  Miranda Frost reminded me of a mild mannered Anne Robinson.  John Cleese protrayal of Q was totally laughable.  Madonna\\'s cameo was crude and unnecessary.  Since I paid my money (and movie theatres don\\'t give refunds) I kept wondering why no one found it cold walking around the ice hotel and what kind of covered sheets would need to be used on the ice beds for sleeping.  I enjoyed Madonna\\'s techno-enhanced (think Cher\\'s Believe) theme song titled Die Another Day.\"', '\"The much ballyhooed Owen Wilson was the worst part of this film.  Not that he\\'s an unlikeable personality, he just delivers flat, useless lines, most of which are obvious ad libs.  Jackie Chan, always likeable and not so ready to play with the dialogue makes this middling comic western watchable.  He\\'s slowing down a bit with age but his quicksilver moves are still blinding by anyone\\'s standards and his unique knack for physical comedy is an always welcome additive.  The problems with this film is the substandard direction, third act writing and the fact that Wilson seems unwilling to play an appropriate character.  He had the chance to send-up any number of western icons from Paul Newman to Kirk Douglas and manages to prove he he hasn\\'t got a clue what his character was meant to be.  He gets on your nerves fast and stays there despite the odd laugh he does manage to generate.  The story, though derived from other western sources, is solid enough.  Putting Chan in the Old West (Well actually the Canadian West doesn\\'t much resemble New Mexico but hey this a B movie anyway) as a hapless member of the Chinese Imperial Guard tracking down the kidnapped princess he\\'s smitten over is actually quite good, even clever.  But it tends to not deliver on the promise it holds, building toward a completely contrived outcome which is a shame.  Some of the deleted scenes on the DVD fill in some plot holes but really the wayward direction and the last few pages of the script seem to be the problem.  On a whole the film succeeds best when it\\'s sending up some of the more famous westerns, but Owen Wilson and Director Dey all but water it down. Has some good moments but not a classic by any means.\"', '\"`The old one\\'s were better\\', was the first thing my friend said while we were leaving the cinema. Although this phrase is quite often (too often) used in connection with Bond movies, I had to agree with him under the impression of Die Another Day. The producers\\' pressure to present `more\\' than before increases from episode to episode. Therefore, the evil opponents become too evil, the tricky devices become almost supernatural, the story is utterly unbelievable, and at some points in the film one might think that one is watching a Harry Potter movie.As a Monty Python lover, of course, I liked the new Q scenes with John Cleese best (wasn\\'t he called `R\\' in the previous movie?). Another reason why I wanted to see the 20th Bond as well was that part of it was filmed in Iceland. Unfortunately, all that is shown of this beautiful country is a palace built entirely out of ice. And this palace does not exist in reality. A personal disappointment.In the Trivia section I read that there are references to all previous Bond films included. This is a nice idea, and for confirmed Bond fans it is surely a lot of fun to find them. But needless to say, I didn\\'t notice any of them. Bond is not much of a public pleasure any more Â– unfortunately.\"', '\"Funny western, a feel good family film worth a watch\"', '\"The Fast and the Furious is one of those movies that everybody watches and majority of people like , although it predominately appeals to the brainless boy racer a!shole genre there is no denying th almost street racing craze it has a hand in playing. The plot is not the the brainiest so don\\'t go expecting a grossing movie and the acting is a little drape and the script is quite crap to be honest . But then at the end of the day it is a movie that you would check out for the action as there are some very well made car races and sequences put together. Personally I would not look into it saying it is the best car movie made as there have been better ones out there like Gone in 60 secs but it is worth a rent , I mean if you get fast , cars women and action and semi good acting from Diesel , Brewster and Rodrgieuz.THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS : 6.7 OUT OF 10\"', '\"The problem that The Fast and The Furious has is that it is inconsistent. It at times is a police drama, at times a car movie, a gun movie and a romance. As a result, it fails on all counts, and fails spectacularly.\\nThe acting is pitiful, but the writing may be worse. There are times where lines are delivered so poorly that the actors seem to have simply given up trying to salvage the train wreck of a script. The attempts at \"street cred\" are embarrassing (\"dawg,\") and the film\\'s method of sounding technically proficient is to deliver lines of dialogue that sound like the actors are reading an inventory list at AutoZone.The most frustrating thing about the movie is that it refused to budge from its somewhat complex story line. While nothing brilliant, the story was more developed that a standard action flick\\'s. This is only a problem because the film was absolutely not up to the task. The action was nonsensical, and surprisingly scarce. The movie lacked a true protagonist because everyone was far too annoying to root for. The actors themselves seemed lost; milling around, reading lines.It is important to mention the cars themselves, though, since this is being billed as a `car movie.\\' And that depends on what is expected from a car movie. If you are hoping for Camaro SSs and Hemi Cudas, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for Acuras and Hondas, you\\'ll see them. If you\\'re looking for Ronin-style car chases or Blues Brothers silliness, you\\'ll be disappointed. If you want to see tiny cars driving in straight lines in fifteen-second bursts, you\\'ll see it.In the end, the only thing I found at all satisfying was the romance aspect of the movie, which the furthest thing from my mind when I bought my ticket. If I were Vin Diesel, I would have taken one look at the script and one look at my cast mates and then I would have stolen one of their souped up jalopies and hightailed it back to a real movie career.\"', '\"Ocean\\'s 11 was the first in what became an unwanted trilogy, but I think most people forget the others and just watch this one.And it\\'s not actually that bad a film. It relies very, very heavily on the chemistry between the main leads (Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Roberts) but there is a decent story being told too.There\\'s lots of witty banter and one-upmanship that is entertaining and the heist itself is well directed.It can at some points come across as being a little overly smug though, in a sort of \"how can you not like this film?\" way. I found it a little self-indulgent as well.Overall, the best in the trilogy that shouldn\\'t have been a trilogy at all.\"', '\"I wasn\\'t expecting too much when I went to watch this movie. I got about what I was expecting out of it. It\\'s your typical Jackie Chan flick, only in the wild, wild west. If you like Rush Hour 1 or 2, then I\\'m sure you\\'ll like this one.      Recommended if you like Jackie Chan or Owen Wilson. 2 *\\'s out of 4 *\\'s.\"', '\"This movie had plenty of good effects, but the producers forgot the most important rule. Story, story, story. The movie can not be about the special effects. Example, Lord of the Rings: major special effects, but they are secondary to the story. The story is what makes it a great movie. If you go back through movie history, the movies that last are the ones with a good story. This movie has the FX, but no story. Second: Dialogue. It was terrible. You have always expected Bond to throw out suggestive comments in every movie, but in this one they forgot to look up the meaning of \"subtle.\" Sean Connery was the master of the double entendre. It helped that his writers gave him good ones to use. In this movie it is obvious they are catering to the MTV, Beavis and Butthead crowd that probably never finished high school. Here\\'s a tip. Use some of that $142 million budget and hire some decent writers. Acting: Mostly bad. I happen to be a big fan of Brosnan. I think he is the second best Bond next to Connery. But it was a struggle in this between his acting and the bad writing. I liked Rosamund Pike. They would have done well to cast her as the good one, but I guess they are following the footsteps of the last movie where Sophie Marceau stole the show from the awful Denise Richards. As for Halle Berry, I could write a book about how bad she was. It amazes me that she actually believes she was hired to be a new sort of Bond girl, i.e. smart, tough, and able to kick butt just like Bond. The problem is that she IS a new sort of Bond girl. Most of the previous ones were smart and tough and able to take care of themselves. Witness Ursula Andress, Maude Adams, etc. With Halle Berry and Denise Richards, they have basically made it obvious they are just hiring according to bra size. Halle was nothing more than a bimbo with a big chest. She couldn\\'t act her way out of a paper bag. Okay, off the soapbox. One last thing, the music. The Madonna theme was absolutely the worst Bond theme ever. Even in the bad days of the Timothy Dalton films, they at least had good music. Someone should tell Madonna that her career actually died quite some time ago, and would she please accept that and stop torturing us. Cheers.\"', '\"Well, first to tell, I\\'m a big fans of Mission Impossible\\'s Movies and Tom Cruise also. This movie really rocks, although, there\\'s some impossible movement in this movie. Well, maybe that\\'s the reason why they call this movie, mission impossible.Can\\'t tell, how much I like this movie. The actions are cool and awesome. The drama is a little touching. Unfortunately, I don\\'t really think that Thandie Newton is the right person to play the Nyah\\'s role. No hard feeling. In my opinion, she\\'s just not the right person to play this role. I don\\'t know if there\\'s another person who feels the same with me. But, overall, this movie is quite good. I would like to rate this movie (from 1 to 10), 9/10. Great job, Tom.\"', '\"For those of you who have seen The Jack Ryan films or read the Tom Clancy novels (Hunt For Red October, Patriot Games, Clear Present Danger) you would likely be familiar with the character of Jack Ryan. For those of you who have not, The Sum of All Fears is chronologically the first in the Jack Ryan novel/films. To some degree, I liked this movie. I mostly don\\'t care for Ben Affleck though he did not do a bad job in this one. I won\\'t spoil the plot for anyone who has not seen this though I will say if you have read the book \\'sum of all fears\\' than don\\'t expect the film to follow the book accurately because it doesnot. Anyway, while the movie held my interest for the most part, I was very perplexed by an event in the film that falls out of line chronologically with the Jack Ryan series. Since I did not check the \"contains spoilers\" box, I am obligated to not reveal which scene I am referring to. So I will just say that since the sum of all fears is supposed to be the first in the series, this one scene that I am referring to led me to believe that the producers of the film overlooked a major script flaw. Despite that, I found the movie to be interesting though not quite as good the other Jack Ryan films.\"', '\"Watching George Clooney and Brad Pitt battle it out for smoothest cat in Vegas shouldn\\'t be this much fun to watch. \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" is a smart, breezy caper comedy that glides along on enough wit and cool, jazzy energy to make you enjoy getting snookered by the pretty boys.Clooney is Danny Ocean, a con man who just lost four years and his wife to a term of confinement in the New Jersey penal system. Now he wants to get even, with interest. He plans a scam involving himself and ten confederates, including right-hand man Rusty (Pitt), targeting three of Las Vegas\\'s richest casinos in a single evening for a nine-figure haul.Asked why, Danny shrugs and says it\\'s because \"it\\'s never been tried.\" Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack would say otherwise, but this \"Ocean\\'s\" is cooler, funnier, and more suspenseful than theirs. Normally I\\'d rather watch Frank and Dino than George and Brad, but the latter two made the better film.Ted Griffin\\'s script and Steven Soderbergh\\'s direction do a lot to sell you on a clever if shaky plot. When Danny asks his wife Tess (Julia Roberts) why she dumped him, she responds with a line that keys in on the way the picture operates: \"You\\'ve met too many people like you.\" Danny, Rusty, and their merry criminal associates seem to communicate mostly through nods and one-liners, not wasting time explaining things.\"I owe you for that thing with the guy in the place,\" is how one of the Eleven, money man Rueben (Elliott Gould), puts it to Danny. This in-the-know argot works for everyone else, too.A lot of movies try for the big ensemble cast, but this one finds the right balance between star power and character performances. My favorites: Andy Garcia as a standout bad guy and Carl Reiner as the oldest, most sympathetic member of the Eleven.While there\\'s not a lot of depth, you hardly mind when what you see and hear gleams and purrs the way \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" does. \"Eleven\" is both a puzzle picture and a love letter to Vegas at the turn of the 21st century, with its dizzying array of gaudy monstrosities and gyrating dancing girls. The music is a frothy stew of Elvis, Perry Como, Berlin, and Debussy. It pulls you in, and keeps you from thinking too hard until long after the credits roll.Yet I find \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" more enjoyable on re-viewings. I say this despite the plot holes in the way things work out. Plot holes or not, \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" puts care into how it works. You get to actually enjoying how the film sets up its misdirection plays and basks in the impossible smoothness of the lead characters. And the dialogue is hilarious.**SPOILERS BELOW***** SPOILERS Everyone has noted one thing I missed, the stacks of flyers that magically appear inside the vault. But about Danny spending all that time being \"beaten up\" in that guarded room, especially when the lights go out? Aren\\'t there too many witnesses to trace Danny and the others to the scam? And what about the mini-scam played on young Linus (Matt Damon), when he is told Danny has been taken out of the operation, only to be surprised when Danny greets him inside an elevator? Why pull that on your youngest, least experienced team member? Well, it was a fun reveal, and I guess that was the point. SPOILERS END ***\"', '\"I can\\'t believe that I wasted part of my life on this crappy movie!  The first movie was pretty good, but this one was terrible.

I\\'m always waiting to hear him say: \"and i\\'ll f*** her in an uncomfortable place...\" (See Mallrats). Anyway, he delivers perfectly.Now the problems (and the spoilers!!). Is it me or is the US navy portrayed as a bunch of idiots? How can russian Migs come within 1 mile of a carrier group undetected??? Also, is russian air control so incompetent that US jets can actually overfly a military base undetected ? The movie also gives a very bad image of russian border guards... Let\\'s say that had we known the russian border was so loosely guarded, we would have invaded the country long ago ;-)As this movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel, I also saw the usual \"oh-so-highly-sophisticated\" character development, typical of Clancy\\'s work. The heroes are brilliant but surrounded by incompetent public servants/military... and the bad guys are incredibly stupid. It is absolutely unbelievable that such blubbering idiots can have lived past puberty... To top it off, we also get the usual russian and arab clichÃ©s... All that is missing is the IRA guys...I was happy to know that the movie was filmed in part in Montreal.

These two talented actors took the easy way out -- 8 years between BOYS 1 and BOYS 2 - isn\\'t long enough. Teenage boys who love SHOOT-EM-UPS / BLOW-EM-UPS might like it -- or somebody who\\'s been hitting the pipe, but it didn\\'t work for me. This film was mindless, over-kill, too long, too loud, obnoxious, and punctuated by all the EXPLOSIONS. Even the slim subplots were silly -- OOOOO, Cuban Drug dealers, where did they come up with that great, fresh idea -- Johnnie Cockran\\'s defense of OJ ?? The chase scenes have been done over and over......French Connection did it better but that was 32 YEARS AGO -- or do BIGGER and MORE EXPLOSIONS automatically mean that it\\'s better ? I don\\'t think so, but what do I know, I\\'m a mature adult !! Disappointed, you bet !! I LOVE Will Smith, when he picks GOOD projects. What\\'s next for Will Smith, Ali or Wild Wild.....never mind.

I also feel sorry for all the actors who have to play in this junk because that\\'s a pretty good cast almost allstar cast and it\\'s sad that this movie is one of their best known.Where the actresses and the great costumes can be seen in the film nothing happens except that a character in a provocative disguise rips somewhere the other two are in the background we are turned on for a few minutes then it goes to the next place and the whole thing happens again with one of the other three women characters.I have little idea of the original TV series but I doubt that was a decent adaptation if the series was not so good from the beginning and is therefore unsuitable for a movie adaptation.\\nin some places it seems like one of those exaggerated films that are supposed to cast a satirical view of the original, but that\\'s not cartoony enough, for a good adaptation of the original it\\'s not serious enough, for an action comedy writer it\\'s neither exciting nor funny enough for a Guilty Pleasure, the movie is not erotic enough for a Guilty Pleasure, the movie is not over the top and embarrassing enough and for a good movie, the movie is not good enough.\"', '\"I totally agree with most negative reviews on this one. Not much to add except this...Any woman who is interested in strong female characters and real girl power should avoid this film at any cost as it will only insult her intelligence.The movie is a horridly failed attempt at being hip, exciting and fun. The soundtrack is way overdone and does not feature any original music, only tried-and-true chart hits which are swapped for other chart hits every other 10 seconds. Needless to say the film is quite tiresome.Apart from this music video-approach the movie shamelessly copies the Matrix bullet-time camera-work and fake kungfu by actresses who probably can\\'t even beat a 12 year old karate student. All the ridiculous action scenes are completely over-the-top, which was probably intentional, but is equally annoying.Add (or subtract) to this the lame humour, the low believability in what is virtually no plot, and the complete lack of charm of the ladies, and what you have is a film that is a complete insult to the original show. The TV show might have been cheesy but at least it was far more entertaining with charming, beautiful women,who fought with their brains rather than with phoney martial art-moves.Go watch the TV-series and don\\'t waste your time on this turd. 1/10\"', '\"Superb sets, stunning stunts, gadgets galore, Halle Berry, John Cleese, virtual reality (not new for Next Generation fans), double-entendres, big bangs, hovercrafts, product placement, great cars, interesting locations - this Bond movie seems to have it all.  No expense is spared for this historical Bond epic and you really want it to succeed.  It has lots of references to previous Bond films.  The brilliant all too brief scene between Bond and Q (John Cleese) sums up the last 40 years of Bond gadgets with some snappy comic dialogue which would need a repeat viewing to catch all the gags and references.  The incoherent plot is as ludicrous as ever, but tries to make it more serious with a united US/British fight against terrorism (North Korea) theme. The first third of the film is great and the middle third keeps a pace, but the final third seems to lose a little direction and drag a little. What the film desperately needed was a bit more R&R in the middle to prepare us for a frantic final third.  However, the real reason for me that this is not a great Bond film is that there is very little gadget-free Bond on show.\"', '\"This movie brings what a perfect day off would complement: endless fun. There\\'s really nothing else to it. awesome! go see it!\"', '\"You expect a lot with a cast like the one in this movie, which probably is one reason you may end up disappointed. Somehow all these good actors just didn\\'t work. Can\\'t remember the original, though I saw it years ago, and can say the same about this one. Remakes very seldom work, but apparently lack of good original scripts makes the studios shoot out all these remakes. The funny notion was that Julia Roberts walked on the high heels like a farm girl. She could\\'ve have had heavy boots on just the same. Otherwise a fantastic actress, but if she isn\\'t used to heels like that, why make her wear them. For me this was a waste of time and money.\"', '\"First I must say this movie is a very good follow to the first part. The strength (comedy,action) of the old men in black part is still in this movie and without Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones this movie wouldn\\'t be so good. In the movie you fell no second boring and it\\'s a really good popcorn movie\"', '\"Give a five year old a movie camera and tell him to film playing cowboys and Indians with Tonka trucks and you have Bad Boys II, a disgrace that somehow took 8 years to reach fruition. It\\'s probably the most racist, homophobic and degrading experience you\\'ll ever see. I don\\'t even think Michael Bay knew he was making such a movie which only adds to his incompetence.\\nThe basic logic of the movie is something like this, if you are a cop then it is okay to kill as many people as you want in the most brutal way possible (inadvertently causing our \\'heroes\\' to become fascists, bigots and subliminally eviler than the main villain). There is also subtext, something along the lines of; all ethnic minorities are either murderers, drug dealers or some kind of foul human being and all country-dwellers are inbred, racist Klan members. The movie spews hate in the faces of every audience member who has been misled into believing they are watching an action-comedy.Miami is a place with a very diverse ethnic population and I think it is completely irresponsible for the filmmakers to have behaved in this way. Maybe a five year old with a movie camera would have been too grown up to have allowed this.As you can tell by one of my older reviews, Bad Boys was hardly a unique or original movie but it worked because the style made up for the lack of intelligence and Mark Mancina\\'s musical score was very strong. It gave every scene a beat, tied them together and sounded mighty cool. Well, that is gone! Mancina\\'s buddy Trevor Rabin took over scoring duties for this movie and the cool Bad Boys theme is completely gone and replaced with an endless and dull drone. In fact I would suggest that the score for this movie doesn\\'t actually exist.And there are far too many unnecessary scenes of absolutely nothing that contribute in no way to the already clichÃ©d plot (drug dealers, oooohhhh that\\'s not been done before). It proves that Bay was given far, far too much time and money to do whatever he wanted. The result? A 2.5 hour mess of unremarkable car chases (also highly original, you\\'d never expect an action movie to have a car chase would you?), constant, unironic profanity and sexism.And can someone tell me how the slimy main villain seemed have constant stubble without ever growing a beard? Several days pass by, he doesn\\'t shave and he never grows a beard. The movie would have you believe that all Cubans are this way. A pretty bad representation methinks. Trust me it\\'s not that way in real life. For all this movies attempts at hardcore action the mix with cartoonish violence comes off as incongruous. This is not a no-brainer. It\\'s a racist pile of trash that can be labelled a no-brainer as a desperate last-minute excuse by Michael Bay.It took FIVE writers to come up with this. The fact that they or Michael Bay have been playing Grand Theft Auto:Vice City far too much is clearly evident. Almost every single part of this movie is stolen from some part of that game. From locations, to car, situations, characters and plots. And still it is no.\"', '\"Charlie\\'s Angels is a pretty sad attempt to cash in on the looks of three of the more attractive actresses working today (although I am sad to say that Drew hardly fits in that category anymore), and the film\\'s similarity to the traditional James Bond formula is a little hard not to notice. Cameron Diaz is an absolute bimbo in this movie, and although Drew Barrymore plays a relatively respectable character, her effectiveness isn\\'t that great, especially given her whiny performances in such recent movies as Home Fries, Never Been Kissed, and The Wedding Singer. The biggest contribution that Drew made to this movie was getting her boyfriend to take a bit part in it.Despite the lack of creativity and the blatant sexual exploitation of Charlie\\'s Angel\\'s, there can be no denying the fact that it just had some good action and at least a few scenes that were really good. There was some fighting action that was really fun to watch, despite the fact that the cinematography was literally stolen from The Matrix, and let\\'s not forget the fact that the Thin Man, with whom the angels had their first confrontation and who made surprisingly classy appearances throughout the film, was the guy who played George McFly in the great Back To The Future trilogy (well, part I and some of part II, anyway). Those are some of my favorite movies ever, and I haven\\'t seen him in many other movies, so I thought it was really cool to see him in a movie again.\\nCharlie\\'s Angels is an un-creative action crime film that continuously and excessively exploits the hotties that star in it, and relies almost solely on their looks as well as some flashy music to push the movie along. There can be no doubt about the fact that the music in the film was thrown in just to promote the soundtrack and make more money. There was hardly a second that went by that there wasn\\'t another song playing, regardless of whether or not it had anything to do with what was happening on screen. There\\'s so much trendy music packed into this movie that it almost overshadows everything else. Notice that they put that ridiculously popular Jennifer Lopez song (the title of which I don\\'t know or care to know and, of course, by Â‘ridiculously popular,\\' I mean that it\\'s ridiculous that it is popular) over the end credits. Some of the music was good, but it was poured on so thickly that it becomes cloying and suffocating. LL Cool J definitely said it best during the opening scene of the movie, `Walk out.\\'\"', '\"This movie is bad. It has no excitement: -too predictable -too unrealistic actions by Bond (surfing scene beats all) -too much money spend on special effects, too much money spend on mediahype.James Bond has integrated too much in current \"entertainment\".\"', '\"Let me start off by saying that I\\'m a big fan of Brosnan.  He is my second favorite Bond after Connery.  I think that \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" is about as close as you can get to a perfect Bond movie.However, I was shocked at how utterly terrible \"Die Another Day\" was. They completely took the tried and tested Bond formula, threw it out the window, and replaced it with CRAP!Bond films are supposed to have dramatic throwaway openings that get you all fired up for the rest of the movie.  This film spends about 20 minutes showing Bond getting tortured.  Oh Joy.  Show me more.Then they fill the movie with plot devices like genetic manipulation, gadgets like the invisible car, and locations like the ice palace that are to silly and unbelievable for even a Bond film.Finally, they try to shoehorn in \"cute\" references to all the other bond films.  Someone somewhere thought they were cool for thinking this up and probably broke their arm trying to pat themselves on the back. It is all just pointless and far too forced.I was glad to see John Cleese finally take over the Q role but unfortunately it might be his last time. As bad as this movie was, I\\'m not sure they\\'ll make another Bond film.\"', '\"Dumber than dumb! This is the movie that spawned a dynasty of sorts and encouraged numerous little boy and girl racers the world over to turn up the gas. It\\'s a crime caper with a fetish, not just for sleek, fast cars, but for handsome men with buffed up torsos, (the \\'attraction\\' between leads Paul Walker and Vin Diesel makes this possibly the most homoerotic movie of its decade). Ironically, and tragically, Walker himself was to die in a motor accident several films down the line.There isn\\'t a frame of this nonsense you can believe in and the driving sequences, which make up most of the movie, are the stuff of fantasy. Nevertheless, enough boys, (and girls), with a penchant for boy\\'s toys loved this enough to make \\'The Fast and the Furious\\' movies one of the most successful franchises of all time. Give me \"Bullitt\" anyday.\"', '\"Much better than the first one, but still...not so good.  I keep waiting to get interested in what was happening.  The action scenes are very well done, and at least you can understand what\\'s going on, which you couldn\\'t in the first.  Altogether, it\\'s just another big noisy summer movie.  So what? I\\'m getting really tired of this kind of movie.  You\\'d do much better with your entertainment dollar to go see SHANGHAI NOON, which has a lot more heart.\"', '\"Just a quick comment. The producers of this series are forcing the writers to write more action than is desired. I know, Bond IS an action series, but , for me, the last few Bond flicks have too little witty repartee and too much action. Also..the action...fantastic stunts is another Bond (tm)..now we\\'re doing it via CGI/Computer enhancements...not good. Liked Cleese as Q.\"', '\"After watching the trailer, I had some serious doubts about this movie. \"It has nuclear arms? Oh no! Another \\'stop the bomb 2 seconds before it goes off\\'-movie?\"The first positive thing was, that the russians weren\\'t babbling idiots, like they usually are in this type of movies. However, the fate of the a-bomb really left me stunned. \"They actually did that in this kind of a movie? Wow!\" were my first thoughts.However, you could say that the actual suspence begins from that moment, and it keeps getting better. If you\\'re going to watch one movie about stolen nuclear arms, this\\'ll be what you\\'ve been waiting for.I gave it 8 out of 10.\"', '\"I\\'ll tell you what ... THE worst movie ever made.  I can\\'t even believe I paid the $5 to rent this piece of DVD-Trash and I feel even worse for those who paid much more to see it in the theatre.Where to begin, where to begin.  Why not start with the plot, since people here keep saying it doesn\\'t matter.  Okay okay, so there actually was no plot, but that\\'s not going to stop me from ranting.  This movie had no focus or direction.  In the beginning it\\'s this kid wanting to be a street racer. Then he\\'s a cop trying to stop an electronics theft ring. Then it\\'s some half baked attempt at a love story ala Romeo & Juliet with the kid and the family who doesn\\'t accept him. Then it\\'s a story about ripping off some truck.  Oh ya, and the occasional car race.  And as if that couldn\\'t get any better, this movie even comes complete with an evil Chinese syndicate(could we get any more stereotypical????).I guess I should talk about the cast now.  Um ... ya, what an amazing cast of stellar bad-actors.  Yeesh!  Although I suppose it\\'s not all their fault (well, except for Vin Diesel), most of the blame belongs to the awful script and terrible dialogue.  I watched Jordana Brewster for 3 years on As The World Turns, she\\'s a good actress.  She was great over on ATWT.  But here... the height of her performance is the frequent use of \"Stop the bulls&@% !!!!\".  Paul Walker, he may be good, he may not be.  You can hardly judge by this movie and I havent seen him in anything else.  To me, it seemed like a classic case of casting based upon looks.Speaking of bad dialogue.  The absolute worst element in this movie was all the male ego BS.  The worst example of this was the ending scene with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel.  Paul Walker\\'s character, the cop (just thought I\\'d reiterate this) was chasing down Vin Diesel\\'s character in one of the movie\\'s few car chases.  Diesel\\'s car is smashed into by a truck and the car\\'s totaled.  Walker pulls his gun on him and looks like he\\'s going to do his job and arrest him.  But what does he do?  Hands him the keys to his car and says \"I still owe you a 60 second car\" and lets him ride off.  Then the movie ends.  Hopefully, what we didn\\'t see was Walker\\'s character suspended from the force, followed by a hearing, followed by an arrest and sentencing for Aiding and Abetting.Now this wouldn\\'t be a good review if I didn\\'t mention the car stuff. Firstly I found it extremely annoying that this movie threw in so much car gibberish that the average movie goer like myself had absolutely no clue what was being said.  Second, the car stunts were few and extremely lacking in excitement.  How exciting is it to see a car go in a straight line?  Not very.  How exciting is it to see 5 cars try and rob an 18 Wheeler?  It probably was, but by that point in the movie I simply didn\\'t care.  And also... if the truck driver is shooting at you with a rifle ... why are you still chasing him?  To save some redneck who most of the characters don\\'t seem to like, and end up killing two of the people you do like?I could go on and on about the flaws and annoyances of this movie ... but I don\\'t have the time.  I like action movies ... when they\\'re GOOD.  But this was not good, not by a long shot.\"', '\"In first film Ethan Hunt has person, but in M:I 2 Ethan is idiot. Film looks OK.\"', '\"I only started to watch the Bond films a year ago. I enjoyed them.Then I came up to the 20th - Die Another Day.I remember seeing this movie advertised when I was young, and not really thinking much of it as I was only nine, not interested in James Bond.I remembered this and rented it thinking it was going to be good.I was wrong. Well, it\\'s still a good action movie...but not a good bond film.I found it to be too......techno-y and unclassy.Sure its the 20th and this was meant to be a great bond film to kick off the 20th century, but they kicked it a bit too hard.But still, if you\\'re into bizare action movies then I guess you might like it.\"', '\"The name is Bond, James Bond. Now with 20 films and been going on for nearly 41 years, james bond is still going strong, he still doing the moves and he\\'s still with the women. I am a massive big fan of James Bond, i have all the bond movies including Casino royale and never say never again. My favorite james bond actor has defiently got to be Roger Moore, i think he\\'s class but i know there is a lot of people who like Sern Connery and Pierce Brosnan more than Roger Moore.\"', '\"Look, all I want to say is: save your money, this movie is poorly filmed, badly written, and is not funny.  Moreover, the special effects are nearly identical to those in the first and there wasn\\'t one new thing to interest me.  It\\'s a very short movie, that\\'s one good thing about it.\"', '\"\"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" is a remake which certainly is worth seeing --- if you like this type of movies like I do. Frank Sinatra\\'s film seems really naive compared with this one, which also looks naive if we don\\'t suspend our disbelief, but I think each viewer is able to do that and enjoy the movie or at least enjoy the actors on it. There is one interesting point: the films of the 50s and 60s which tell the story of thieves usually are spoilers (I don\\'t know if this is the right word to use here) because they make us like the thieves and then they are caught in the end (for example: \"The Day they Robbed the Bank of England\"). So, one thing good about movies about thefts nowadays is that we can be fairly sure that our favorite characters are going to get away with it, like for example \"The Entrapment\" with Sean Connery, or  \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" with Pierce Brosnan. \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" seems to me to be better than these movies. Don\\'t miss it if you understand what I have been talking about.\"', '\"Ocean\\'s 11 is the story of 11 con artists/thieves getting together to rip off a wealthy casino magnate in Las Vegas.  After we get to know everybody a theme of Robin Hood against the Sheriff of Nottingham comes to mind.  Then the heist--although their methods can be explained as impossible to pull off by any stretch of the imagination one doesn\\'t care because we are lifted away to a place where rooting for the bad guy is mandatory--kind of like in the Sting only about a tenth as convincing or enjoyable.  Conversely, it\\'s not fair to compare this film to the Sting because the Sting has a sound track that compliments the thoughts and actions of the characters, the era, scenes and locations.  In O-11, The entire look and feel of the movie is back ground to, or is over shadowed by, a loud thumping repetitive bass and drum track which evokes nothing to the imagination but perhaps annoying car or jeans TV commercials. Las Vegas overflows with a rainbow of diverse music--none of which resemble the sounds in the O-11.  Only twice, and very briefly, does the sound track support the locations, scenes and characters: the entrance of Sahl (played by Carl Reiner), and the very end of the movie.  Gen-X folks will most likely be the only folks who can relate to this sound track.  This movie, unlike the Sting, will never be a classic because of the irritating, emotionally devoid, dated, loud, frustratingly repetitive sound track (which one can not call music).  In addition, because the history or magnitude of the relationship between Roberts and Clooney is never apparent, we never really care about the Julia Robert character--it is unimportant to the movie and her performance is week and boring not to mention there is no chemistry at all between her and Clooney.  In fact, all the characters (with the exception of Reiner, Damon, and Garcia) seem to be acting or pretending and thus are not convincing.  On the bright side, the script is clever and humorous.  And there are some fun twists that surprise you.  If you enjoy repetitive, loud, bass and drums, you will like this movie. If you like a good mystery/adventure/heist movie--try watching with the captions on and the sound off--it\\'s much better that way.    C+\"', '\"Great acting all about this movie, just finding one part of it believable is the trouble.  Yeah, I know, it\\'s only entertainment, but hey, at least some of it can be believable.  To say that anyone could talk eleven people into robbing a casino without telling anyone is highly unlikely.  But I have to admit, it was a fun movie to watch.  Nice to see the underdog come out ahead.  I would recommend this.\"', '\"This remake of the 70s cult hit that helped launch Big Hair (RIP Farrah) is so cartoonish that by comparison the original seems as complex as a Bergman movie. Still, it\\'s all in good fun. High spirits, nice cinematic fight scenes, dopey Bill Murray (always welcome), bend over shots (nothing too racy, though) of three really fit and appealing women. What more can one ask? There are enough allusions to the original (the speaker phone, for example) to get the audience involved in the referencing game and make us all think we\\'re so clever; it\\'s an effective strategy to get us on board. Since the movie is a reinterpretation, it has to add something extra to the vapid quality of the original. Besides the stylised violence, here, director McG goes for colour. Almost nobody gets seriously hurt, and the girls don\\'t use guns. But the bright and sometimes grating colours drag the audience into the pacing, since they are so forcefully vivid and jarring that they unconsciously keep the audience on the edge of its collective seat. It\\'s a happening, man, like Rowan and Martin\\'s Laugh-In. Whatver, someone knew what they were doing and managed to overcome the inherent silliness of the whole concept. Enjoy the movie, go along for the ride: it\\'s fast paced, and the three stars are sufficiently airheaded (to give them credit, they manage to communicate being modern without playing up sex) that they gain our sympathy.\"', '\"I expected the movie die another day to be pretty bad but not a turkey.This movie have absolutely no signs of classic Bond-things,i mean even the thing my name is Bond,James Bond isn,t with this movie.It is also a really bad movie even if you not a Bond-fan.Bad performance,bad dialouge and bad visual effects.Pierce Brosnan sucks but worst is Halle Berry and its not going to be better for her to play in a stupid film like Catwoman.Madonna doing a horrible song to this movie and she also play so bad.The absolutely worst Bond-movie ever and i hope that Tarantino who has suceed with Pulp fiction can make a better movie.I don,t care about how bloody it is,just a better one.\"', '\"Ah, The Fast and the Furious, the film that launched the careers of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and, for all intents and purposes, Michelle Rodriguez, (yes she starred in Girlfight previously). This foursome was so hot after this movie that some of them couldn\\'t demean themselves by starring in the sequel. Poor them as, just a short eight years later, they all jumped at the opportunity to reunite with fast cars in the fourth installment. Oh how the mighty fall, especially when they weren\\'t too mighty in the first place. I had my own preconceptions about this popcorn flick, virtually making me never want to take a chance on it at all. I thought the acting would be amateurish and campy, the story ludicrously absurd, and the cheese factor too high to overcome. Well, after finally sitting down to check it out I realized that I was clairvoyant. I wanted to at least have fun, and for a couple moments I did, but overall this Rob Cohen disaster is a throwaway that only shows how influential teenage boys are in the Hollywood spectrum. How else could we have three theatrically released sequels to what could be a made-for-TV movie at best? I see the similarities to Point Break, as my friend told me existed. It even goes to the point where if I closed my eyes I could have believed Paul Walker was Keanu Reeves. Where this film goes wrong, though, is by having Brewster\\'s character involved, taking Walker\\'s love away from Diesel. What works so well in the before-mentioned Kathryn Bigelow film is that there is more than just allusions to a man-crush between Reeves and Patrick Swayze. That dynamic doesn\\'t quite exist here. Walker\\'s Spilner/O\\'Connor may respect Diesel\\'s Toretto, but he never idolizes the man. He sees a misguided soul that watched as his father burned to death on the racetrack, he sees a man who is nothing without his sister and racing teamâ€”his own makeshift family. Whether it is Toretto who is behind the truck-jacking or not, Walker is only staying close to find out, and get with Brewster\\'s Mia of course.Speaking of the truck-jacking, is it just me or is that opening scene completely out-of-place? The film begins with four Hondas harassing a trucker, taking the driver out and, I guess, stealing the shipment. The cut is so abrupt that you never do find out what they do with the cargo, if anything. In fact, having the next scene in daylight with Walker, I thought maybe he was involved already, waiting for the criminals to meet up with him. Instead, he just floors his car, swears, and is all of a sudden at Mia\\'s diner. It is so discombobulating that I seriously wanted to just turn it off. Only when Walker goes back to work at Harry\\'s do we find out why he swore driving, and it\\'s even longer until we find out where the trucks come into play. But this isn\\'t trying to win awards for storytelling, it\\'s just doing its best to entertain and titillate. Unfortunately, it did very little of either.The acting is pretty horrid across the board with Rodriguez probably the best of the four in a limited role. I didn\\'t mind Diesel too much, the guy has charisma, but Walker\\'s Keanu-speak was distracting because I don\\'t remember him ever talking like that in other films. And when the cast is rounded off by stilted delivery from Rick Yune, Ja Rule, and Matt Schulzeâ€”the moment when Brewster asks Walker out and Schulze elbows the wall in anger made me laughâ€”you know you shouldn\\'t be expecting very much else. Although, Chad Lindberg, as the whiz-kid engine technician, showed a lot of promise. I guess even the most asinine of films has a diamond in the rough somewhere.If anyone reading this has wanted to see it, don\\'t let me stop you. I\\'m the first to admit that I have never seen the appeal of cars, either in their speed or in their look. The Fast and the Furious is all about the cars, so it had a pretty large strike against it from the beginning. I also don\\'t particularly care for action films devoid of a strong story. That said, however, I had a fun time with the trucker\\'s revenge sequence at the end watching Diesel attempt to save Schulze. It all kind of gets ruined with Vin\\'s \"anger\" afterwards and his blind rage for payback against Yune\\'s Johnny Tran, but at least one high-octane moment kept my interest. It\\'s a good thing too because the ending is as abrupt as the start, answering all questions about where our two leads\\' relationship will go with wordless looks and nods. These two understand each other; they are kindred spirits who have opened their souls. One is a hardened criminal and the other an undercover cop, both with the streets to unite them. No loose ends are sealed and the fate of many is left unanswered. I\\'d love to see how Walker explains who was stealing the electronic equipment to his superiors. The filmmakers probably never thought a sequel would be imagined and felt pretending it didn\\'t matter would be enough.\"', '\"(this review contains many SPOILERS)There\\'s a scene about half-way through The Sum of All Fears where CIA Director Cabot takes a phone call from Jack Ryan while attending the Superbowl. He\\'d sent Ryan on an important mission concerning a potentially missing Russian nuke. Ryan is calling to tell him that \"the bomb is in play.\" Now, perhaps the words (if he heard them) lead Cabot to believe that one of the QBs was going to toss a long one, because, unable to hear over the rowdy crowd, he hangs up!The logic of the film had been steadily spiraling downward at that point, but that scene made it crash land harder than Ryan\\'s helicopter in a subsequent scene. Why would the CIA director simply hang up? Ryan does call back, and is able to relay his message to Cabot, whose reaction is to look up at the dome ceiling as if the bomb is going to drop through - or perhaps he was watching the winning field goal being kicked.The rest of Sum reminded me squarely of Thirteen Days, but only in content, certainly not in quality. Thirteen Days makes this movie look particularly inept. The story shifts between Ryan\\'s completely implausible exploits - why does he go to a warehouse on the Baltimore docks expecting the bad guys to be hanging around after a nuclear blast, for instance - to the conflict between the President and his freaked-out staff on Air Force One. The idea in the latter was to show the panic and potentially bad decision-making that could result from such a crisis, but it was handled so poorly, with such ridiculous dialogue and unbelievable acting that it made no dramatic impact. At one point, someone has a heart attack (to which someone says he has a heart condition - no kidding) but the consequences of that are never known. In fact, no consequences are ever made known, and too many important details are mentioned but not shown.Ryan\\'s method of talking down the Russian President is comical, and an insult to the audience\\'s intelligence, and is predicated by his having met the President during an odd photo shoot in the Kremlin. The Russian President doesn\\'t trust the American President, but he trusts a junior CIA agent who once wrote a paper on him. Totally non-sensical.Regardless of the current climate in the world, The Sum of all Fears is simply a poorly constructed film, with a bland leading man, banal dialogue, and preposterous situations trying to disguise themselves as intelligent and relevant.\"', '\"The cast alone makes this film worthy of a quick look.  Brad Pitt excels in a role that he has consistently proved himself in.  The movie relys heavily on using a plot twist.  This creates fresh perspective for such a film style but it has traditionally been hard to raise such a film style away from the \\'predictable plot twist\\' created by its wide spread use.  All in All a film worth seeing quickly.  Certainly not one to challenge an audience or break ground, but interesting none the less.\"', '\"Like hundreds of films this one has followed them in that the sequel is not as good as the first one!  Fair enough it was funny and i laughed but it lacked tension.  There were many parts in which i was falling asleep.

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return to where it all started. Kinda\\'. With the original being such a hit, the sequel had a lot to live up to and though it wasn\\'t quite as funny, it still managed to crack a few jokes while providing an action packed story. I think that Lawrence and Smith make a great duo and I would love to see more collaboration from these two. For the time being, enjoy it. I sure did!8/10\"', '\"This movie was a serious disappointment.  Afflek is TERRIBLE as Jack Ryan; the plot is very predictable; many interesting cinematographic opportunities that could have been taken were missed.  Most of the shots are uninteresting, in a movie that ought to have lots of impressive effects and camera work.  It is as if the director and screenwriters were forced to make the movie when they didn\\'t want to do it.  Save your dollar and rent almost any other action movie.  Tom Clancy is listed in the credits as an executive producer; I hope he got something out of this film because I know I didn\\'t.\"', '\"I\\'m watching the whole series (I only saw 1 and 2), so this is the first one. I liked it for what it was when I was 15 or something, but even then I knew it wasn\\'t good.Besides the awful acting and mediocre at best dialogue, I have to say It was good (just that, good) for a while, which was surprising. All the set-up was fun, even if dumb of course, and the 2nd act was good, creating tension for Paul Walker\\'s character.And then... they dropped the ball. They made a scene that could\\'ve cut a lot of boring minutes of this movie, and justify the ending at the same time.And yet, they keep going, wasting all the tension just to have a stupid last motivation for the characters to be where the writers wanted them to be. Again, they didn\\'t need the dumb Hollywood 3rd act because by the end of the second they had the characters in good position to finish the movie. But they wanted more chases, and races, and cars blowing up, and they made a bit of a boring flatter ending.It\\'s \"ok fun\", 5 points.\"', '\"This movie, has by far the best car racing scenes ever filmed, as well as the best cars. They are gorgeous machines, and these guys certainly can drive them. Great story, not just another Gone in Sixty Seconds where all they did was steal cars, there actually weren\\'t very many race scenes as you might expect, but every shot is filled with cars, and lots of them. The acting is great as well, as usual Vin Diesel gives a brilliant performance, as Dominic Toretto. It has already earned a massive following, and when you leave the theaters you will be filed with such a massive adrenaline rush, that you and all your buddies will be left with the feeling that you must go out and race. Everybody I have talked to have said the same thing, it just has this crazy adrenaline rush it gives you. I highly recommend this to all fans of cars, and racing, but it has something for everybody so see it even if you are not a fan of either, bottom line, just see it!!!!!!\"', '\"I cannot find any other words to describe what I felt after watching Mission Impossible II.  Good action is not worth it if there is not a decent plot. Apparently we didn\\'t have enough silly face changes in part one and then had to confront many other stupid face changes in part two.

Instead they chose Ben Affleck and i have nothing against BA but he\\'s miscast here. It\\'s just impossible to accept that this skinny 20-something pretty boy knows more about geopolitics than the president and all his advisors. Al Pacino was miscast in Godfather1 and did a great job, but in general it doesn\\'t work to cast a young pretty face as a tough guy.SPOILER - Best part of the movie was when the nuke went off. The scene was cast in a football stadium so i expected a tactical nuke that would take out the stadium but no--- they blowed up all of baltimore! Worst part of the movie were the worthless love scenes between ben and his girlfriend.Morgan Freeman has a big part as a presidential adviser and as usual, dominates every scene he is in. In so many films he plays the part of the cool, soft-spoken, super-intelligent guy and he has perfected it.\"', '\"Bad Boys II is not a great movie. Then again, it\\'s not actually bad. BB2 falls into the middle category. The humor doesn\\'t work even on the half-ass level of the original, but the action has picked up pace. And even though MollÃ\\xa0 is nowhere near as good as the villain Tcheky Karyo was, he pulls an ok if a bit boring performance. I\\'d just like to point out that Will Smith is a hell of a lot better and accomplished actor than Martin Lawrence. What in the world is his name doing SECOND in the opening credits?! After films like Black Knight, What\\'s the Worst That Could Happen?, National Security and Big Momma\\'s House, Lawrence should be forced to drop to his knees and thank God for still having a career in the first place.

This could be interpreted as either a good thing or a bad thing - it\\'s true that the sense of intrigue and constantly twisting plot of the original is lost. In M:I2, the plot is fairly simple, and each twist becomes clear far before it happens. But enough plot is still decent, as IMF (Impossible Mission Force, hence comes the franchise title) agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) races to stop rogue agent Sean Ambrose (the ever excellent Dougray Scott) from obtaining a killer virus called Chimera, after the monster from Greek mythology. To get to Ambrose, he recruits Ambrose\\'s ex-girlfriend Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to rejoin her ex, and act as the \\'inside woman\\' for the team. This develops adequately enough, leading to the necessary insanely complicated aerial acrobatics, which are strongly reminiscent of the first film, and a bone crunching motorcycle chase to enormous man-to-man fistfight at the finale. Not too profound perhaps, but for an action movie, it\\'s not bad.The script is very hit and miss; it\\'s true there are some excellent and endlessly quotable lines strewn throughout, but we get stuck with a lot of overly dramatic clunkers like \"We just rolled up a snowball and tossed it into Hell\", which would be easier to overlook, had the cast put more enthusiasm into their performances. Indeed, Tom Cruise acts as if it was not his choice to return this time round, and Ving Rhames as computer hacker Luther Stickel is equally uncomfortable in returning. But Dougray Scott is consistently excellent as dastardly villain Ambrose, and Thandie Newton, Richard Roxburgh as Ambrose\\'s chief henchman and Brendan Gleeson as a crooked industrialist working alongside Ambrose all give great performances.There is also an unexpected cameo from Anthony Hopkins as Hunt\\'s mission commander Swanbeck, which would have worked better had he been developed into more of a major character, giving Hopkins more to do. As it is, he is good-natured enough with his fleeting minutes of screen time, and he\\'s given some great lines, much in the line of M from the Bond films.Speaking of Bond, when did Hunt turn into his carbon copy? In the first movie, the filmmakers worked hard to keep the two secret agents easily distinguishable, but now Hunt seems like a pale shadow of Her Majesty\\'s finest agent. The love plot is handled entirely in the style of a Bond movie, cheesy innuendo and all, Hunt\\'s relations with Swanbeck are entirely the same as how Bond reacts to M, and there\\'s even a car chase through the mountains plundered directly out of Goldeneye. Thankfully, further into the film, Hunt starts to develop more of his own personality, but there\\'s a strong scent of Bond all the way throughout.The directing, which in the original was smooth and effortless, is sped up and choppy in the sequel. Director John Woo plays to his strengths here, but overindulges his fetishes for slow-mo and kung fu moves, making the film seem simply ridiculous at times. Even for a secret agent, it is more than impossible to take as much physical punishment and perform as many gravity defying martial arts moves as Hunt does at the film\\'s climax, and do we really need to see a slow-mo shot of Hunt walking towards his car? Clearly, realism has left the building, (particularly in the end showdown, which is entertaining to be sure, but one can\\'t help but laugh as Hunt pulls off far too many martial art tricks on his adversary) and it\\'s more glaringly obvious in M:I2 than most similar action films.But in spite of all my criticism, I enjoyed this movie a lot. Because it is essential, quality film-making? Definitely not. But what it is, is some good, old fashioned, BIG LOUD FUN. Our over glorified hero takes on and defeats countless enemies while performing breathtaking stunts to the sounds of a consistently excellent blaring rock soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. What more can you ask than that? M:I2 was a genuinely entertaining blockbuster which supplied all the car chases, explosions, shootouts and death-defying stunts to make a truly excellent action film. Who really needs all that other stuff, like story or script anyway?-7/10\"', '\"The original TV series (especially the early years) was dynamite.  For the most part the plots centered around completely covert actions where the public didn\\'t even realize anything was going down.  This was an exciting action movie but my big objection was that about only one-third (at best) was true to the MI genre - and those parts were really terrific. I also have a big problem that there has been internal corruption in the MI force in both pictures.\"', '\"Pierce Brosnan - I think he\\'s done a good job restoring Bond back to his sleazy roots, but the time has come for him to pass the torch.  He just looks old now and I couldn\\'t suspend my belief as he beat up martial arts experts half his age.  Time to go, bring on  Christian Bale.Plot - One of the best Bond plots I would say.  The Icarus is a great idea and there were enough twists to make it interesting.Bad Guys - The Korean guy with silver bits in his face was quite good, but he wasn\\'t in it enough.  The British guy started off a bit like Alan B\\'Stard but got better as the film went along.  The only thing that pissed me off was that as if it\\'s not bad enough English blokes playing bad guys in American movies they\\'re now playing bad guys in what is effectively a British movie.  When are we going to get a bad guy who is American?Opening Credits - Well it wasn\\'t The Spy Who Loved Me, but it was good in that it had a twist in it.Stunts - Generally pretty good and yes most of them are unbelievable but still within the realms of possibility, except for surfing on the tidal wave, which was ludicrous.Bond Girls - Halle Berry, well what can you say?  She is gorgeous and the flirting scenes were great, but, I am going to have to watch Monsters Ball because this woman still cannot act.  Is she the black Kim Basinger? Rosamund Pike on the other hand was great.  Deliciously sexy.Ending - What\\'s happened to Bond endings?  Since Roger Moore left all the big shootout endings have disappeared with him.  Bring them back.Is There Life In Bond - I would say so, but it\\'s going to take another change of direction and probably down a more serious path.  The entendres in this were tired and lazy, almost cringeworthy, which is a shame because Brosnan brought back the cheek into the character, but it just wilted this time.  I know Bond is a cliche, but it has been a good cliche at times. It\\'s in danger of just becoming a parody, if it isnt\\' already.  New blood needed.\"', '\"Ocean\\'s Eleven features an all star cast pulling off a classic Las Vegas heist with a modern twist. The plot makes sense and the pacing moves the story along with ease, if not for the only flaw : a Hollywood attempt at integrating romance in a movie where none is needed. The Great actors bring their characters to life with energy and passion even though each protagonist is more clichÃ© than the last. If not for the ridiculously Sci-Fi looking \"blackout machine\" the film manages to pull off a classy vibe in a very money and stripper themed decor. The music compliments each scene and correctly translates the emotion of the moment though it never really transcends to into anything greater.Time. Time was, and will be, this films greatest enemy. Some scenes drag out too long in the moment and as years pass new viewers will most likely not quite capture the importance of the originality of the twist. Ocean\\'s Eleven, to be honest, seems quite basic. But it pulls off every aspect of cinematography as well as it needs to. Put simply, the movie is fun. It manages to surprise without unnecessary complication and can be re watched with ease.\"', '\"1. The Golan Heights are not a desert. It\\'s a mountainous region where a large part of Israel\\'s water supply originates. And of course there are no Bedouins there. 2. If the bomb was found in Syria, why did they ship it through Haifa and not through a Syrian port, and how the hell did they cross the Syrian-Israeli border? It\\'s one of the most closely-watched borders in the world, on both sides. 3. How could an atomic bomb lie buried for 30 years without being recovered? It should be easy enough to detect due to its radioactivity. 4. Why would anyone be so stupid as to send an unescorted jet with a nuclear weapon \"on patrol\" after so many other jets have been shot down by Syrian AA missiles? As an executive producer, Tom Clancy should have been more careful not to make such gross mistakes. It seems that he is an expert on the US armed forces, but totally ignorant about the Middle East. Clancy was right on one fact, though: Israel indeed was prepared to use its nuclear weapons in 1973 when it seemed to be on the brink of defeat.\"', '\"This movie proves that the \"it can\\'t be bad if _______is in it\" idea is a lie. Even the great Samuel L. Jackson can\\'t carry this turd. He\\'s perfect for the part, but the cheesy clichÃ©s and awful stereotyping is impossible to watch.It\\'s embarrassing that good actors (Vanessa Williams not included) lent their skills to such an awful picture.Obvious and outward police racism that nobody could get away with (today, anyway) is commonplace, but ignored by everyone BUT Shaft.

I enjoyd this one very much.\"', '\"New York City police detective John Shaft (nephew of the original 1970s detective) goes on a personal mission to make sure the son of a real estate tycoon is brought to justice after a racially-motivated murder.This was a strange film. First, there is no way to make \"Shaft\" without having the actual Shaft playing the character. However, Samuel L. Jackson is probably the only person who could have attempted to fill the role, so at least they cast as good as they could.But the movie is strange in general because of Christian Bale\\'s character. His racism is so over-the-top that it almost makes no sense. The movie seems forced. There is no doubt that racism is alive and well, but the examples here were so exaggerated it was almost comic. (In retrospect, I am glad it was Bale... always nice to see an A-lister doing something corny.)\"', '\"First of all i just want to say that i have read other peoples reviews for this movie, and whilst i appreciate those i would like to offer my views on this film! Before i do so i would like to inform you of this:1. I have never read the book or any other Tom Clancy books 2. Prior to watching this i had not seen the Harrison Ford take(s) on Jack RyanThe reason i am telling you this is because i love movies, and watching this film with no other mediums influencing my verdict of this, may be the reason my view is different from others.Personally i thought that this movie was pretty decent. A modern day action film where you don\\'t have to think about the movie too much, you just sit back have some munchies and enjoy- If you like the films of say, Bruce Willis, you will enjoy this!This film is not perfect and i wont tell you its the best film i have ever seen but it is enjoyable and has a decent story, Morgan Freeman is as reliable as always, and i thought Ben Affleck did a good job on this movie! A lot of people jump on the \"i don\\'t like Ben affleck bandwagon\" without watching the films. (and i know how bad Gigli and Phantoms were but trust me this is better)Maybe not as good as the previous films or the book but a highly enjoyable flick, watch this film again and tell me you don\\'t think the same!!!\"', '\"A rarity--a remake that\\'s better than the original. 11 men led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) prepare to rob a vault linked to 3 casinos in Las Vegas. His partners in crime include Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Matt Damon and Scott Caan. Also, the casinos are owned by Tery Benedict (Andy Garcia) who is romancing Ocean\\'s ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). Fun, engrossing, just simply the most enjoyable film of 2001. It moves smoothly, the entire cast plays it cool and easy and Steven Soderbergh directs it with flair and intelligence. Yes, it\\'s light; yes, it\\'s a trifle but it\\'s so FUN! I really loved this film. Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers. My only complaint--Julia Roberts (the only woman in the cast) is shot very cruelly. She\\'s beautiful so why does she look so bad? Aside from that this is a fun movie. Just sit back and enjoy.\"', '\"This movie was absolutely terrible.Why? Well, first, let me say it was poorly written. It felt like it went for five hours, and when I thought it was over, somehow, the incompetent police let the bad guys escape with the girl. These are the same group of police who trashed Miami and gunned down many, many people on several occasions and still had their jobs at the end of the day. This is not fun. This is stupid.The use of the \"f\" word is usually to ADD to a script, it\\'s not half of the entire script. There are too many skits which aren\\'t FUNNY. Laughing at a female cadaver isn\\'t funny. It merely highlights the sloppy script.Implausibility is the name of the day here - nothing makes any sense. There is no logic. The film has a strong smell of \"anti-drug\" propaganda which pervades it like a hooker\\'s funk. This foul stench goes through every aspect of the film. They even repeat jokes which weren\\'t funny the first time. So you can\\'t remember the words to \"Bad Boys\" (the song), so what? Go and make real movies, you punks.Michael Bay likes to use really fast camera shots to make the action more interesting than it is. It doesn\\'t work. Will Smith\\'s character is extremely arrogant, and he seriously needs some acting lessons by the way he plays his part, it looks like he ad-libs the script and knocks over props, whereas Lawrence\\'s character has had enough (probably of the franchise) and wants out. I don\\'t blame him. I don\\'t blame anyone for not wanting to be a part of this disaster.Action movies do not come any more costly than this movie - it went into incredible special effects which were just for eye candy and were mind-numbingly dull. Over the top, BORING car-chase scenes which feel like they take up hours of your time will ruin your day. The gun-fights are ludicrous - the heroes (not one of the main characters, mind you) will get shot once in the leg or something while all the bad-guys get nailed.Haven\\'t we seen this before? Oh, yes, in every single other action film. The movie is a complete rip-off of every other better action movie ever made (name one). Bay has even re-used some of the terrible story in The Island, which, for my money, was MILES ahead of this garbage. Bad Boys 2 is utterly derivative and all traces of it should be wiped from our history. Just think - in millions of years, if somebody finds this planet and find traces of this movie, they\\'ll think that we humans never amounted to anything but mindless violence and poor dialogue and a movie that should\\'ve ended half an hour before it did.This bloody movie has reignited my anger disorder. I hate it more than words can describe.To sum up - do NOT watch this film if you have ANY self-respect. It is a blemish, not only on films, but on society as a whole. HORRIBLE. -10/10 stars - worse than ANYTHING ELSE - EVER. Having one\\'s fingernails removed with pliers is like a party game compared to this rubbish. Unfortunately, I have to rate it 1 on this site, as it doesn\\'t have negative numbers in its rating scale.\"', '\"I remember thinking about 20 minutes into it \"Okay, the acting is terrible, but the plot\\'s okay\".  An hour into it I was thinking, \"Okay, the plot sucks too, but the action scenes are good.\"  By the end, even Woo\\'s trademark \"bullet ballet\" couldn\\'t redeem this movie. The entire audience was laughing at just how cliched and obvious this movie was.  I go a long way on \"suspension of disbelief\" when watching action flicks, but this movie ate up my reserves and left me on empty well before the grand finale.  It became a game to see JUST HOW MANY tired cliches they could fit in at the end.Except for the fact that characters actually DIED, the stunts and action seemed better suited to the A-Team than to a modern thriller.  It would have been far more effective if it at least had Mr. T and George Peppard -- or better yet, Peter Graves and Leonard Nimoy -- people you EXPECT to see in cheesy over-the-top cartoonish tripe like this.Maybe the low budget of Hong-Kong films is a GOOD thing.  I usually love John Woo movies, but if this is what happens when he gets his hands on a major studio budget, I wish he\\'d go back to the chop-socky stuff that made him famous.This movie is almost bad enough to be recommended on that score alone.  It\\'s no Plan 9 From Outer Space, but it is stupendously awful.\"', '\"I\\'ve seen the movie and i loved it. The mix of the actors, producers, cars and scenario\\'s was super. This movie really rocks. Next week i\\'m going to see it again. I never went to a movie more then once, but next week i\\'m going to see it for the 3rd time.see yah\"', '\"Plus it has the always reliable Rosario Dawson in it. Just for her you\\'ve got to love the movie (or at least not hate it, in my opinion). But this movie delivers on the same formula that made the first one a success. The earnest Tommy Lee Jones, who apparently had no idea, why people would think he is funny, or it\\'s just a rumor. Whatever the truth, his straight face against the clownish Will Smith works perfectly as it did in MiB too.For some reason (maybe creative, maybe because it didn\\'t succeed to top expectations), this was the last MI(I)B people had the pleasure watching for awhile. But of course a third one would be on the way. I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s necessary to watch the first one to get this, but it\\'s always good to have some back-story.\"', '\"Sure it was over the top,  sure it was a bunch of crazy nonsense, but I wouldnt have wished for it to be anything else. Woo directs this film masterfully and Cruise excels (well somewhat, it just seemed a little weird watching him do cart wheel kicks) but so what, it was as far from being real as possible and thats why you gotta love it.  Its a movie to sit back and let dazzle your eyes with magnificent spectacle. The story ain\\'t bad either and it will keep you satisfied. dont read the critics reviews, they\\'re just synacle #%@holes anyhow. This movie was completely different from the show, and not that close to the first movie either, as it should have been, it has aged with the times now go see it.\"', '\"Although i did watch this film to the end (it would be wrong of me to comment on any film after watching only 10 minutes) i really really do wish i had never turned on the TV and thought this would be better than what was on Channel 5(britons will know what i mean). i suppose the main reason for watching was to see the girls looking hot, but i should have at least turned the volumed off + they didnt look hot just stupid. The original series was charming and light hearted with genuine classy ladies that were hot, unlike these 3 bimbos. The film is so poor i am at a loss to why the staff of IMDB gave this an overall rating of 7.9.The best bit of the movie was destinys child hit song. this film has no redeeming features and why oh why are they making a second film? This is film making at its worst!\"', '\"Unfortunately this was one of those cheesy sequels where the funniest parts of the movie were summarized in the preview. I am a huge Burton/Elfman fan, and while the music was decent, the music alone can\\'t make a movie. In this case, it seemed more like Mars Attacks! than anything else. Too much cheese for my taste.\"', '\"Not exactly the most thought provoking of films. However, if you want to watch things explode, people shooting guns and driving fast in cars, along with some gratuitous girls in bikinis, (and hey, which red-blooded male doesn\\'t?) then it\\'s an enjoyable way to spend 2hrs+ with some mates if you leave your brain at the door. Some of the cop buddy-buddy stuff is a little overdone, but some of it had me (and a large proportion of the cinema) in stitches. Well worth watching if you liked the first one and want more of the same.\"', '\"I had heard both good and bad things about this movie, when I finally rented it, hoping that Will Smith and Martin Lawrence could at least crack a few jokes for me to laugh at. Boy was I disappointed.This movie is, of course, an action comedy. Well, here\\'s the problem... Mostly the action is totally uninteresting or confusing, and the humour is pretty much non-stop. Too bad about every joke fall flat. This movies dialouge consists of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence running around and cracking one-liners at each other at a startling rate. Amusing? Not the least. The most used word in this movie has got to be \"shoot\". \"Shoot her, shoot him, shoot them, he shot himself, they are shooting at us!\" etc. etc. They say shoot all the time, and that pretty much also sums up the movie.When Will Smith and Martin Lawrence aren\\'t walking about cracking one-liners they are shooting. Shooting at jamaicans, shooting at russians, shooting at cubans, shooting at pretty much everyone. And they aren\\'t really rolemodel policemen either. \"Hey, he\\'s got a gun. Let\\'s shoot him.\". Wow. How amusing.\\nAs I stated before, the action is mostly uninteresting and confusing. But sometimes, it lightens up. During one of the many car chases there comes a moment where a terrorist is hanging on a car door, and it opens up and smashes against a pillar. This was a nice moment, even if it was just effect. Some other nice moments happen during the jamaican shootout.So pretty much, to sum this movie up its: Pointless and boring dialogue with one or two jokes that are funny plus heaps of mindless, uninteresting and confusing action, along with a few nice action moments.I\\'d rate it a 4/10. There\\'s definetly alot better of stuff to rent out there, and I wouldn\\'t really want to recommend this to anyone, unless they are a DIE hard fan of both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.Oh, and if you thought that there wouldn\\'t be any bullet-time effects in this movie, you\\'re wrong...\"', '\"I can\\'t sit through this plodding boring piece of garbage.\"', '\"It was with a mix of anticipation and dread that I saw the newest James Bond movie, \"Die Another Day.\"  This is the 20th Bond movie in 40 years (since nobody counts \"Casino Royale\"), and it\\'s good to know that little has changed but the scenery.  Indeed, why Bond has survived this long is a mystery to me, because as soon as we sit down to watch him, we know he\\'ll save the world, get the girl(s), and beat the villain.  Few franchises could keep so close to the formula for so long and survive.Pierce Brosnan is back as the titular spy, still full of charm and double entendres.  This time, however, he\\'s been kidnapped by the North Koreans for over a year until MI6 reluctantly rescues him.  Even M (Judi Dench) doubts his usefulness in the modern world.  In order to prove himself, Bond decides to track down the agent who double crossed him in North Korea.  Along the way he joins forces with an American agent named Jinx (Halle Berry), tangles with the diamond-encrusted Zao (Rick Yune) and the so-smarmy-he-must-be-evil Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens).  And don\\'t forget another Bond girl, fencer Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike), whose name says it all.The movie is certainly a step up from the painful \"The World Is Not Enough\", but not quite as good as \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" or \"Goldeneye.\"  Halle Berry, for all the hype surrounding her role, is only barely serviceable as a kick-butt secret agent.  She lacks the proper gravity for the role, but she certainly looks good in her catsuits and Dr. No-inspired bikinis.  It\\'s a shame that she has a hard time pulling off any role that requires a body suit (i. e. \"X-Men\").  The villains are not quite as good as previous ones (who can forget Famke Janssen\\'s Xenia Omatopp?), and the plot, as always, is unnecessarily complicated.  However, since they\\'ve actually hired a real director for this one -- Lee Tamahori of \"Once Were Warriors\" fame -- the movie looks great and the action scenes are remarkable in their absolute excess.  Brosnan\\'s a great Bond, and the movie hews very close to the Bond formula while managing to slip in a few new tricks here and there.  There\\'s probably more CGI imagery in this movie than in all the other Bonds combined, and the electro-stomp theme song by Madonna is a nice step away from the traditional orchestra-and-random-diva numbers we usually get.Bond is about excitement and fantasy, and that\\'s certainly what we get.  A good movie, despite the absence of the best Bond girl in ages, Michelle Yeoh (who was rumored to originally be in the movie).  Little extras: Madonna\\'s cameo as a fencing instructor is amusing if slightly gratuitous, and make sure you stay until the end for the best Miss Moneypenny scene in decades.8 out of 10.\"', '\"There is a certain inanity to \\'The Sum of All Fears\\' and it begins to grate after a while. It is Jack Ryan (portrayed here by Ben Affleck) constantly being seen by his government superiors as \\'the boy who cried wolf.\\' Yes, this is a continuing aspect of the character, but it is WAY overdone here, to the point of absurdity. Ryan is belittled, ignored, disbelieved, lectured, and generally made to look like a fool. At one point, he actually has a member of the cabinet on the phone during a crisis in which Ryan has a crucial piece of the puzzle, and the guy hangs up on him! Please tell me our government isn\\'t THAT stupid. The story basically is that a mischievous third party tries to provoke a war between Russia and the United States, and damn near succeeds when they acquire an old Israeli nuke that disappeared back in the 70\\'s. They set it off in Baltimore and the US administration naturally suspects the Russians. The problem is, the film audience learns about the weapon very early on, and so Jack Ryan\\'s uncovering of the truth, in bits and pieces, seems interminable. Between no one else in the government believing him and the agonizing amount of time it takes him to put two and two together, filmgoers may begin tearing their hair out. Ben Affleck resembles Alec Baldwin\\'s Jack Ryan much more than Harrison Ford\\'s. Despite the urgency of much of his dialogue, Affleck comes off a bit shallow, and at times seems more annoyed at things in general than worried about the possibility of a nuclear showdown. Like the whole thing is keeping him from ordering concert tickets or something. Morgan Freeman plays his boss at the CIA and he\\'s good as always, and James Cromwell is quite believable as the US President. \\'The Sum of All Fears\\' doesn\\'t feel a part of the same world really as the other Tom Clancy films, even with the presence of old hands like Cromwell. The Ryan character is diminished too much, and there is no other presence in the film substantial enough to take his place. So we essentially have an ensemble piece about a horrific set of events with a lot of interesting things taking place and a number of characters dealing with them. Taken on those terms, \\'The Sum of All Fears\\' is a decent thriller.\"', '\"Die Another Day (2002): Dir: Lee Tamahori / Cast: Pierce Brosnan, Halle Berry, Toby Stephens, Judi Dench, Rosamund Pike: Title refers to multiple risks agent 007 takes. He is in South Korea where he not only disrupts a crime but he is betrayed by his own agency. During the erotic credits he endures fourteen months of torture and imprisonment. When back in action he seeks the one who betrayed the agency. Unique setup with numerous plot twists climaxing with vengefulness. Director Lee Tamahori delivers everything that fans could want. He previously made such films as The Edge and Along Came a Spider. Pierce Brosnan in his fourth Bond outing is solid and engaging. He still holds the ability to defuse dangerous women using charm and wit. Halle Berry is appealing as Jinx who is also seeking out the same villain. She will prove to master several abilities that will factor into her survival. On the other side we have Toby Stephens who is disappointing as the villain. He comes off as a really irritating frat kid than an evil mastermind. Also appearing is Judi Dench as the agency head who is strong at first when she defuses Bond then it is business as usual for the character M. Rosamund Pike plays a double agent who adds a sense of mystery and danger as well as sex appeal. Spectacular production values prove that Bond will indeed live another day.

Tom Cruise has been delivering the goods for a few years now - but this was not the same character as the first film. I had flashbacks to Cocktail watching this poor excuse for a performance. And what was Anthony Hopkins doing? Did Henry Czerny read the script and decide he didn\\'t want to play Kitridge in this pile of rubbish? Good idea if so. John Woo has not made a good film since he left Hong Kong - Remember the good old days of The Killer and Hard Boiled? At long last, Robert Towne is being exposed as the most over-rated writer in cinema history. Chinatown was great, but there\\'s been a lot of Days Of Thunder under the bridge since then.My favorite moment was when Ving Rhames stepped out of the helicopter and into the script.Where\\'s Brian DePalma when you need him?\"', '\"I liked the film but i didn\\'t love it, like mib. The great part is the cast as they have not been edited to much, The movie is about agent J (will smith) and his trouble with partners in the beginning, but a bigger problem evolves and they have to bring Agent K back.\"', '\"I have never been a big fan of Michael Bay, personally I have a love/hate relationship with his works.  Bad Boys was pretty good, The Rock I didn\\'t like, Armageddon was watch-able and Pearl Harbour bored me to disinterest. It wasn\\'t until I witnessed McG\\'s disaster films that I began to pity Bay a bit, at least he puts forth the effort to make entertaining summer films.I haven\\'t seen the original Bad Boys in years now, but I still recall what great chemistry Smith and Lawrence had on the screen.  Smith has improved a lot in terms of acting ability since 1995 while Lawrence has had some modest success.  Bad Boys 2 succeeds, stumbles and fails at some parts of the film. The first half of the film succeeds, the causeway chase is seriously on my Top 10 car chase list.  I always found stunt drivers and pyrotechnics is so much better at creating tension than watching a CGI figure jump on cars.  It stumbles around the end because the film just feels like it was stretched a half-hour too long, with too many breaks between action scenes with plot (which has never been a Bay strength).  By the end, the film feels exhausted and like it ran out of ideas or scenes to create.This is a part that I\\'m going to write a separate paragraph for due to the attention it\\'s getting.  I\\'m sure you\\'ve heard about the \"bad taste\" humour this film has.  There is a line that exists between dark humour and poor taste, this line is in different places for different people and with some there is no line.  In my case, I felt a little disgusted when Smith was reaching into a dead body for drugs but felt really nothing when Smith & Lawrence were \"interrogating\" the latter\\'s date with a gun.  Like I said, the line is usually there and your tastes will guide you in finding that line.Otherwise, the film is standard Bay stuff: big action, large explosions, non-existant plot and star power.  In Bad Boys 2 an equilibrium is discovered that makes it all worthwhile.6.5/10\"', '\"While, the more recent films in the \\'Mission: Impossible\\' series, are highly enjoyable. This movie is not. It\\'s impossible to watch! Although, this 2000 sequel directed by John Woo is far more stylized and action-packed than the first action reboot film directed by Brian De Palma in 1996, also based off the television show of the same name (1966-1973). It\\'s also, a lot more over the top, and cheesy. While, some people might like that, I found it, to be, too much of a dumb repetitive overused rethread that got quickly tiresome. All the flying doves, unrealistic wire-works, dual-wielding pistols, explosive, mirror shots, and ridiculous face masks make it seem like, I was watching the 1997\\'s action film, \\'Face/Off\\', all over again. It barely resembles \\'Mission: Impossible\\'. You would think a spy movie like this, would have cleverer, well-thought out infiltrate scenes like the original. Sadly, it does not. Instead, the movie fill up the time, with clumsy and pointless similar actions scenes of the Pierce Brosnan\\'s \\'James Bond\\' era, such as people in love, nearly running each other, off the road in car chases, everybody shooting at and drunkenly handling the dangerous, fragile McGuffin that can wipe everybody off, the face of the world, as if it\\'s a bottle of booze, and tons of climbing and jumping off things, just there to feed Tom Cruise\\'s ego. It\\'s really lame. Another thing, this movie destroys with its shallow action, is the sophistical twist and turns of the psychodrama that the first movie, established. This sequel\\'s plot of finding and destroy, a genetically modified disease is unique, but it\\'s also, a bit paper-thin & disappointing. I was really, hoping for something more complex. Something in the same vain as 1998\\'s thriller novel by Richard Preston, \\'the Cobra Event\\'. Don\\'t get me wrong, the movie tries to be smart in its unrealistic out of the blue love-story between IMF agent, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) & pickpocket theft, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), by copying the classic Alfred Hitchcock\\'s 1946\\'s film, \\'Notorious\\', by having a spy falls in love with a woman, whom arrangement, requires her to get back with her ex, in order to find a dangerous weapon. Yet, the screenwriter, Robert Towne doesn\\'t do much new development with it, so the subplot in this film, come across, more like a rip-off, than a homage. The love story was also so bad written with its over-lovely dialogue that the relationship between Hall & Hunt, became so fake-looking that the couple don\\'t even carry over to the other sequels. Despite that, the acting between Newton and Cruise was alright. The two had some chemistry, but the film doesn\\'t give enough time for the characters, much to click. It doesn\\'t help that the villain for this film, doesn\\'t add much, weight to the triangle. He was highly forgettable to the point that I forgot his name for this review. I had to look it up. It\\'s also sucks, that Dougray Scott\\'s thin Scottish accent makes it, really hard to understand, anything that ex-IMF Sean Ambrose is saying. He was by far, the worst thing, in this movie. Regardless of the villain, Tom Cruise doing 95% of his own stunts like the \\'knife near the eye\\' scene, is pretty impressive. I just don\\'t buy him, knowing martial arts. As for the music score, I have mixed feelings about the soundtrack. I kinda dig the new rock version of \\'the Mission impossible\\' theme song with the guitar rip. However, rap-rock band Limp Bizkit \\'Take a look around\\' version of this song is not good, as the lyrics has little to do, on what happening in the film. It\\'s more of an excuse for Fred Durst to defend and bash his critics for their troublesome music career. Regardless, it\\'s not the only song that seems, out of place. The Zap Mama \\'Iko Iko\\' song from the beginning of the film, doesn\\'t match, the Utah desert-like settling. It sounds more like music, you would hear, in a Caribbean Cruise Line with 1988\\'s \\'Rain Man\\' film, playing the background. Another, out of place tune was the exotic Middle Eastern forlorn music, being played, during the love-scenes. Its seems like composer, Han Zimmer was taking a day off, and just gave the leftovers/unused music tracks from the 2000\\'s historic film, \\'Gladiator\\'. It really doesn\\'t match anything, that happening on screen. It\\'s also equally as bizarre to hear music, here, that Zimmer would use in director, Christopher Nolan\\'s \\'Dark Knight\\' trilogy (2005, 2008 & 2012). Overall: All the jarring flaws, this movie, has, proves, without a doubt, in the end, this is one mission, you shouldn\\'t accept. Just avoid. You\\'re better off, not watching it.\"', '\"This is not a movie for people like me, who enjoys in \"reality\" movies. I was trying to find something interesting in this movie. But it is very hard. The only thing that I was really impressed was the cinematography of the movie. Some sequences were splendid. Another rather good thing in the movie was the music and the sounds. These were the only things that made me watch this movie till the end. Everything else was not worth to spend money on it, particularly the script, was boring, predictable, unrealistic,... Let\\'s hope this will be the last MI movie.\"', '\"Yeah keep beating the guy for an hour and have him out only with untied tie, no swollen face, no blood. Aren\\'t you fed up with lies already? This movie is enough of popular fiction.\"', '\"I have three major complaints about this movie:1. The \"satellite-with-diamonds-meant-to-destroy-Earth\" was done, in Diamonds Are Forever.  While it was a different concept, and the satellite was for a different purpose, I couldn\\'t help but think, \"I\\'ve seen this, why aren\\'t you guys being original?\"2. Lee Tamahori\\'s use of \"John Woo\".  There were several slow-mo shots, and each time, my focus was taken away from the otherwise great fight scenes, and switched to comparing it to Woo\\'s style.  There are certain movies where this effect works well (The Killer, The Matrix, even parts of MI:2), but not for Bond.  Bond movies, in my opinion, are not supposed to rely on camera tricks, they are supposed to rely on Bond\\'s suave, but tough style of getting the job done.3. Halle Berry.  In my mind, Bond girls are in the movie for action, but not fighting, if you know what I mean.  Halle is a terrific actress, but she\\'s not meant for this type of role.  When the creators of this film put a big-time star like her into their movie, they have to give that star a lot of screen time.  The Bond girl is not supposed to have a major, or even large role.  Plus, Halle\\'s performance wasn\\'t all that great.  She was good with her looks, but not so good with her acting.All in all, I thought the movie was a good one, but not a true Bond movie. It was too \"Hollywood\"; too much explosive action, not enough Bond-style spy action.  Also, was anyone else furious over Madonna\\'s song and cameo?6 out of 10 stars.\"', '\"DIE ANOTHER DAY is a unique Bond film for me because I had seen the other entries in the franchise before I discovered the IMDb . In other words my only knowledge of its reputation is down to the comments I have read on these pages and because many commentators are so loud in their condemnation ( Bad CGI , awful title track etc ) I was expecting a really bad movie never mind a really bad Bond movie , but DIE ANOTHER DAY wasn\\'t as bad as I was expecting It\\'s interesting to note that the Bond series never really concerned itself with painting communists as bad guys . OCTOPUSSY ties in with the cold war very much as does THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS to a lesser degree but in no way can the series be criticised as being right wing or reactionary with GOLDENEYE wearing its heart on it\\'s sleeve that Russian gangsterism is more of a worry than Russian communism so it\\'s something of a shock seeing Bond battle Stalinist commies in North Korea . That is in no way a criticism either .We\\'re then treated to a bizarre title sequence composed of a torture montage with quite simply the worst theme tune ever devised for a Bond movie . I don\\'t know what is about the Pierce Brosnan Bonds but they all have very poor title songs despite having all round superb production values and DIE ANOTHER DAY continues the high production values , a lot of people complain about the CGI and I must admit the cartoonish jet at the end does look like a cartoon but compare this sequence to all the action scenes in the 1980s which were composed of Roger Moore standing in front of some back projection and no matter how much you don\\'t want to say it you must confess we\\'ve come a long way since then Some people have also let rip that the film is ruined by post modernist self reference but I disagree . Come on chaps when you\\'ve seen one Bond movie since the late 1960s you\\'ve seen most of them . Plot wise DIE ANOTHER DAY is very , very similar to GOLDENEYE with a \" British \" villain in charge of a death ray in outer space with a fair amount of LICENSED TO KILL thrown in . It should be remembered both YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME had the same identical plot with serious hardware being stolen from the USSR and America in order to start a nuclear holocaust . There is a ridiculous amount of humour though involving John Cleese as Q . I know you shouldn\\'t take James Bond movies seriously but did we need an invisible car ?The other thing I disliked was Jinx . Think about it , she\\'s tough and kills without hesitation so how come she needs rescuing from Bond ? She\\'s just a cypher there to create a love interest and it\\'s amazing that the producers seriously considered starting a spin off series with Jinx as the heroine . It would have been as successful as CATWOMEN . There is a problem with a plot twist involving both Gustav Graves and Miranda Frost , the twist is good but unfortunately the surprise only works once which means on second viewing the shock value of the plot revelation is gone therefore DIE ANOTHER DAY doesn\\'t have the same enjoyment second , third or fourth viewing unlike classic Bond movies I\\'m not a big Bond fan but have been fairly impressed with the standards of the franchise from GOLDENEYE to DIE ANOTHER DAY , they\\'ve really come leaps and bounds from the Roger Moore debacles like MOONRAKER and VIEW TO A KILL . One aspect that is over looked in the series is the character interaction between Bond and M ( Convincingly played by Judi Dench ) and I hope to see this abrasive relationship continue when the series returns with a new actor in the lead role\"', '\"It is one of the best films I have seen this year. Wonderful action it had me on the edge of my seat. It was so good I went and saw it for the Third Time. Tom Cruise is wonderful and so sexy in this movie.\"', '\"More of a comedy or lameo attempt at one than a James Bond movie.\\nMoreover Halle Berry is shorthaired and not feminine or attractive. At least she is thin, I will give her that!\"', '\"No, this film won\\'t win an Oscar or anything like that.  But I have a feeling you\\'ll enjoy it.The plot, admittedly, is pretty predictable, at least until the actual heist attempt starts.  There is some interesting sleight of hand here that forces you to do a mental rewind, not unlike \"The Sixth Sense\" and its surprise ending (at least for those who didn\\'t wrack their brains for half the film to figure it out early).  The plan of the heist itself is pretty far-fetched, which does help to heighten your anticipation as to whether they can actually pull it off.  Entertaining?  Yes.  It\\'s still the weakest part of the film, but it\\'s still fairly good.Not that the plot matters, really.  The assemblage of actors here more than makes up for it.  There is nothing flashy about the performances here -- they\\'re simply played well, very straight-faced, very every-manish (or dare I say, \"Bruce-Willis-esque\").  The gang as a whole is an interesting and entertaining mix, and it is these caricatures here that make this film enjoyable.This film is not really a heist film, per se -- it\\'s not about being suspenseful, but rather, much like the Rat Pack it hails from, it\\'s about being smooth and suave.  This cast does so in near-perfect fashion.  There is a certain timing and tone in every bit of dialogue, and he who takes the time to analyze it sees just how well done this film really is.Further reinforcing that this is not a heist film, it ends not with guns blazing but with...well, I\\'ll let you see that for yourself.  I\\'ve mentioned already that there is a lot of trickery involved with the heist, much of it hidden from the viewer as well until the end.  I laughed out loud in the theater when the final trick was revealed, and then my rating of this film went up a couple points.Those seeking Academy Award material may opt to wait for the DVD.  But if you just want a couple hours of entertainment, this film shouldn\\'t disappoint.My IMDB rating: 8/10\"', '\"Who should be insulted more, women or men?  Women will once again have it pounded into their heads that (alleged) beauty is the only thing that matters as far as being successful and getting anything you want out of life; average-looking women need not apply for membership.  Men, once again we are portrayed as stupid, infantile, drooling, panting, single-minded amoebas that would cut off our right arm for a smile from an (alleged) goddess.  Can\\'t somebody create the magic of \"Double Indemnity\" or \"Casablanca\" anymore?  This feature is worthless; I was insulted.\"', '\"This was a really fun movie to watch. It has some intense action sequences. Actually, a lot of intense action sequences. The shooting never stops and the explosions keep on coming. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are hysterical, again. And Joe Pantoliano makes every movie better. The two funniest scenes are when Burnett and Lowery are scaring the hell out of Burnett\\'s daughter\\'s date and after the chase scene with the dead bodies and Captain Howard goes off on the two. Absolutely hilarious! My only gripe is that it seemed that the writers were running low on material and resorted to gross-out humor like rats having sex and corpses losing their heads. Not funny. Otherwise it was very funny, due to the amazing chemistry between the two leads. I still prefer the original Bad Boys, but this is still a great time at the movies. 7/10\"', '\"(*** SOME SPOILERS ***) First, I adore Halle Berry. So, any movie that has her sporting Bond-outfits is for me. But, this movie was so \"over-the-top\" that I found it utterly ridiculous. The movie is about a young man who somehow makes enough money to create and launch a weapon that can wreak havoc on the earth. Bond and Jinx (Halle) have to save the day, and in the process avenge Bond from an earlier setup.Look, I know when you go to movies that you have to free your mind a bit and go along for the ride. After all, it\\'s Hollywood and it\\'s just a movie. But, the premise of a couple of youngsters infiltrating MI6 and launching a mega-weapon into outerspace made me laugh out loud. This film lost me. I gave up on it mid-way, and just found myself saying that if James Bond films have come to this then maybe its time for Mr. Bond to retire. After all, if a group of 20-something criminals can outsmart MI6, the CIA and the legendary Bond then perhaps the sun is setting. Maybe we can have the cast from Spy Kids challenge Bond in the next film! -- DP.\"', '\"This plot line was much better than the first.  The movie had more action scenes and kept me far more interested.  I watched the first one a few days prior the MI2 and what a difference.  MI2 hits it right on the mark for big budget, big star action movies.  A must see.\"', '\"Marketing is like magic.  It really is.  This film was marketed to look like it was action packed from beginning to end.  Kudos to the marketing guys for doing so.  They have to be considered similar to a David Copperfield. Copperfield can give you the illusion that something is there or something isn\\'t.  The trailers for this film do the same.  We are led to believe that MI2 is going to be your typical summer action flick with explosions, car chases, mano-a-mano fight sequences and anything else that will increase your pulse.They lied.The trailer also promises you that John Woo is here to replace a stagnant Brian De Palma in the director\\'s chair.  It also screams to us that it is not going to be like the first one.  It is going to be better.HAH!  What a load of crap!First let\\'s talk about John Woo.  This man has a visual style that is matched by no one.  His propensity to direct a good action film is not challenged in today\\'s Hollywood.  But this is also a man that is in love with the slow motion button on his camera.  We usually see slow motion in everything from people eating a sandwich to reading Shakespeare to yawning as the sun passes overhead.  It is overkill and although I can admit that he is a great artist with a broad stroke in action sequences I also have to say he does not know how to create tension in other areas of his work not involving action.  It also has to be said that I think he is in love with Thandie Newton.  Okay, sure she is beautiful.  But I do not need a close up of her in every shot.  After a while it gets incredibly cumbersome and it tries to dehort you from the inequities of the rest of the film by having her face take up the entire 60 foot screen.  I can understand doing it at first, but come on, 20, 30 times in the film?  It becomes cataclysmic and tiresome.The first film was verbose and silly in some ways, but this one is void of any real action until the final thirty minutes and the director and his camera are in love with the female star.  If Woo likees her that much why not just show her naked once, get it out of the way and then move on.  How many shots, how much film was wasted trying to get her in the perfect light with just the right amount of hair hanging in her face and so on and so on? Too many.But back to the crux of my complaint.  There was very little action here and that is funny.  The final 30 minutes of the film is some of the best action probably ever filmed.  The motorcycle chase was breath taking, the fight scene was tense and exhilirating and the break in by Cruise into the fortress where Sean is negotiating his deal left me awestruck.  That is where Woo excelled in the film.  But what of the first 90 minutes?MI2 has a great climax to the film but that is all it has going for it.  I am actually giving it a 6 out of 10 because of it\\'s style and energy at the end.  But frankly I was bored with the rest of the movie.  If as much energy was put into the entirety of the film as went into the end, and into showing how beautiful the female lead was, then this would have been a great film, as it stands, it is a mediocre one.Prediction:  MI3 in 2004\"', '\"\"Fast And The Furious\" is nothing revolutionary, even the car scenes aren\\'t as good as I\\'d hoped for, but you just have to like the world these characters are living in. Fast cars equals having gorgeous women at every corner (loved the sexy Michelle Rodriguez) and dodging cops all day long.The acting\\'s nice, the cars look good(but a far cry from great since, with the great exception of Diesel\\'s 900 horse power monster, they all look too much alike), and the women doubly so, but the plot in this movie is just the glue that binds together. Some compare this movie to \"Point Break\". Please, the only thing they have in common is that the guy is an undercover cop that lets the \"bad guy\" go free. A good popcorn movie, nothing more.  6/10\"', '\"Bad Boys II is an American action-comedy movie released on July 18, 2003, directed by Michael Bay and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The film features actors Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. This is the sequel to the 1995 film of international repercussion The Bad Boys.SynopsisNarcotics detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) were chosen for a high-tech task in investigating ecstasy trafficking in Miami. The inquiries inadvertently lead them to a larger conspiracy with a self-appointed drug dealer Johnny Tapia (Jordi MollÃ\\xa0) whose ambitions to take over the city will start a gang war.\\nBut the friendship and professional relationship between Mike and Marcus is shaken when Mike begins to like Syd (Gabrielle Union), Marcus\\'s sister. Unless they can separate personal and professional life, the pair is in danger and risks Syd\\'s life in the process.\\nBad Boys sequel script is more stocky and now has to deal with professional and personal life! With this theme the second Bad Boys movie independently knew the story is good, without many clichÃ©s ... Focusing not only on the action, but on the comedy that was one of the highlights of the movie, and the coexistence of two partners who love each other and hate each other at the same time funnier too and more genius action scenes. Although the movie is long I almost fall asleep (I had to wash my face) just so it is still a good movie hit the right dose and for this movie was better than the first. So my movie score is 7 out of 10.\"', '\"God, how i loved this movie! Okay, so the story-line is thin, and the movie has an open ending(which i love because the now can make a sequal!), but the sound of the cars and the total entourage was perfect!! This is the way i would have liked it over here in Holland, but the car-culture is not as dramatic as is in this movie over here- as is the weather!! I found it most entertaining because i completely lost myself in the movie- the movie didn\\'t bore me throughout the 1 hour 45 min. I went for four times to the movies and now own it on DVD. Thumbs up for more of these kind of movies!!\"', '\"This movie rocked in some senses but then I think the ending was abrupt and predictable. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel work well as a team, despite Dom\\'s attitude to the others but the friendship seemed a lot more geunine. Letty was a kewl character, they should have explored it more though. Mia was just another female added in to make Brian\\'s character well a man off course. The car scenes were just excellent, if you definitely have a thing for cars and speed well then this rocks. It has similarities to \"Gone in 60 Seconds\", however I have a different liking for both.\"', '\"I\\'m probably one of the few people out there that couldn\\'t stand the first MI. I thought the plot was week and the acting was horrible, Cruise was so much better in the 80\\'s, maybe he should have stayed there. MI-2 on the other hand was probably one of the worst movies that I have seen in a long time (at least Barb Wire had more cleavage). The last 20 minutes or so had me expecting to see pigs flying around the auditorium. I understand that there is supposed to be some disbelief on the part of the movie patron, but give me a break. This movie made people disbelieve gravity, physics and reality in order to entertain slightly. I\\'m glad that I didn\\'t waste my $7 or whatever it is, to see it.\"', '\"I had expected a great deal from this movie. I even rented the orginal (60\\'s) movie to warm up.

Anyway, it\\'s just entertaining! 8.5/10\"', '\"Unknown at the time to be Brosnan\\'s swan song performance, it was a high note to go out on.Just slightly too campy a 20th Celebration film, the movie simply rehashes the plot points of the films before it, all tied together into one neat package.True, we\\'ve never seen Bond so bruised or for that matter captured, but the realistic spy caper is lost upon the rehashed gadgetry.Brosnan does his usual best, giving another fine portrayal of the world\\'s greatest suave super-spy, even against Halle Berry\\'s sort of stale \\'Yo\\' Momma\\' CIA agent (and she wanted a spin-off too, ha!).More than just a 007 film, it serves as a chronicle of just how long Bond has entertained us, and how we long for more Flemming-esquire adventures.\"', '\"I was afraid this movie would take itself seriously, and I think for\\neveryone who hates this movie, they think it did. My take is that it did not\\ntake itself seriously.  It laughed hard at the whole concept and yet kept\\ngoing as though it were real life.  I laughed out loud several times, and so\\ndid my friends.  Of course, watching Cameron, Drew, and Lucy onscreen made\\nme want to make sure I had my make up and hair all in place, but other than\\nthat slight sense of insecurity derived from viewing the movie, I loved\\nit!\"', '\"This is not a classic, but this is entertainment extremely well-done. It\\'s not deep nor meant to rock your world, but in its own way it\\'s very intelligent and well-written. All the actors have great little characteristics that are just fun to watch. This is the movie that I put on when I just want to escape and not think (along with the 2 others from the series). I know it all and still I enjoy the details of it every time and I notice new things every time. I\\'m never tired of it. The dialogue is fun and witty and again, the acting is really good. You can tell everybody on the set is having fun and enjoying working together. This is why they all accepted a reduced salary in order to be able to do this, and the 2 sequels - otherwise the movie would have cost an insane amount of money. I never saw the first version, and frankly, I like this one so much, I don\\'t think I want to see the other one, because I\\'m afraid it\\'ll ruin it for me :-)\"', '\"When you go to a Jackie Chan movie you know what you will get: breathtaking action, self-deprecating humor and no sex. This time around it\\'s two out of three, and the sexual element was minimal.The main plot deals with Jackie\\'s efforts to recover the Chinese princess from a treasonous kidnapper. But the engine that powers the plot is the buddy relationship between Jackie and the bank robber.My only beef (and it\\'s a small one) was that the two women in the story didn\\'t have nearly enough to do.  In the few scenes they had they were shown to be very strong women. In the case of the Native American woman who Jackie marries. She\\'ll disappear then reappear at just the right time.Even though a comedy, there are some serious moments dealing with racism and the explotation of the Chinese railroad workers.The night before seeing this film, we went to see \"Mission: Impossible 2\". There was lots of action in that one, too.  But all the characters were flat and uninteresting. The characters in SN are not totally three-dimensional, they don\\'t need to be.  But they are a bit rounder than the M:I2 crew. And the ride was a lot more fun.The only other thing I can say is: don\\'t take any restroom breaks or you\\'ll miss something good. IMHO the drinking game that Jackie and his buddy play is the funniest thing that I\\'ve seen on film in a long time.To conclude: see this movie.  No reservations. Nine stars. Uncle Steve says check it out.\"', '\"I was disappointed in the first Mission Impossible film but had heard that this one was better. John Woo directed it. The man who wrote Chinatown did the screenplay. Thandie Newton was in it. Everything sounds great. So what happened? MI2 is a mess, and not even an entertaining mess. For an action film, it\\'s quite boring at times. There are long gaps between action sequences, and one has to endure some of the worst romantic dialog to come out of Hollywood in some time. Thandie Newton, who was so charming in the otherwise mediocre Truth About Charlie, is totally wasted here. I\\'m still trying to figure out how Robert Towne goes from writing Chinatown, which was so intelligent and stylish, to this dreck, which makes some of the bad, late-night, low-budget action shows on cable TV look pretty well-developed and coherent. An absolute flop of a screenplay. This was the first film I had ever seen by John Woo, and I can only assume that his earlier work is what gave him such a good reputation. When he finally does give us action sequences, they go on far too long and often seem ridiculous. If you find the opening sequence of the film - Tom Cruise \"rock climbing\" - silly and unbelievable, stop the video there and go on to something else, because it\\'s not going to get any better. The worst combination for an action film is to be dumb AND pretentious, and that is what Woo accomplishes in MI2. His trademark use of slow-motion gets old quick and leaves you feeling like you\\'re watching some slick perfume ad on TV. This is especially true towards the end of the film, when doves come flying out of the smoke and fire. Rather than care about the climax of the story, I\\'m wondering if a naked, anorexic blonde angel is going to appear and whisper \"Action Film, the new fragrance from Calvin Klein.\" It\\'s just silly stuff, with no sly, tongue-in-cheek awareness of its own silliness.And there are so many holes in the script... And those masks... What is it with the masks? It works the first time, seems old the second time and is just plain ridiculous the third time.I\\'m guessing Woo was an influence on the Wachowski Brothers, so I could be reading this wrong, but he seems to rip off several elements from The Matrix, which was released a year earlier. If only he had bothered to make MI2 as tight and smart as that film!If you\\'re an action fan, get the DVD and skip to the chapters with the fight/chase sequences. The story doesn\\'t make much sense and the actors struggle with the terrible screenplay, so you\\'re not missing anything important. If you\\'re a fan of the original series or of intelligent spy films, forget it. As bad as it was, you\\'re better off watching the first Mission Impossible movie. At least that had some class. And I\\'m sure any James Bond film would be more enjoyable.\"', '\"This is a Funtastic Film.  It has all of the predictable Bond quips, but remains upbeat and scintillatingly delicious.  All of the magic of James Bond has remained steady for all of these years.  Halle Berry is rivetting. Judi Dench remains convincing and believable.  The special effects are breathtaking.  I was especially impressed with the huge tidal wave and the glaciers crackling.  It is a first rate Bond Movie and is worth the effort.\"', '\"Is it a crass rehash of an old TV series that wasn\\'t that great to begin with? Or is it a clever distillation of 1970s entertainment spruced up with a welcome blend of comedy and flash style? I can\\'t really decide, but \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" manages to earn its wings, if not a halo.Sorry. Be warned, though, there are a lot of bad puns in this movie. \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously, and if you don\\'t either, you can have a bit of fun.The set-up is instantly familiar for those of us old enough to remember the ABC-TV series. Three beautiful young women work as private detectives for a mysterious millionaire, who gives them impossible assignments they carry out with ease. The latest job involves a computer tycoon named Knox who is kidnapped, apparently by a rival. The Angels set out to save him, then find out the case is more complicated than it appears.That\\'s not really important, though. The big question: Which Angel does the best hair flip? I have to say its Lucy Liu, though Cameron Diaz\\'s short hair doesn\\'t give her much to work with and Drew Barrymore\\'s Angel with attitude isn\\'t really flipping her hair unless she\\'s in a fight, which kind of buries that bit of business for her. Not much else distracts from the hotitude of the stars, suggesting that the trainers on set were Oscar-worthy even if the cast wasn\\'t.The script is kind of weak, not that the show itself ever was \"St. Elsewhere.\" Caught wearing only a bedsheet in a guy\\'s apartment, Barrymore\\'s character is asked if she\\'s \"working undercover.\"More funny are the exaggerated references to how deadly these pretty ladies really are. \"They come on all lovey-dovey, until they find out I can shatter a cinderblock with my forehead,\" sighs Liu. Here at least the comedy works as a kind of running gag worth pursuing.This silliness is abetted by Bill Murray as Bosley, the Angels\\' major domo, working his comedy mojo in a lazy but effective way, describing a jail as looking like \"Cher\\'s bedroom.\" Diaz has the most fun with her part, as Natalie the klutzy cutie, showing off a wonderful body as well as some fine comic chops left over from \"There\\'s Something About Mary.\" Whatever happened to her, anyway? I also really like Crispin Glover, as a bad guy who never says a word but steals every scene he\\'s in with creepy gusto. Too bad the film never seems to know what to do with him, though at least he\\'s not wasted like Tim Curry is here.For the most part, director McG and his writing team just use the story as an excuse for action scenes that are often impressive but don\\'t make sense or connect up with anything else. These Angels are hard to distinguish from bad guys, as they crash cars, depressurize airliner cabins, and generally wreak all kinds of havoc on unsuspecting civilians. You aren\\'t supposed to wonder about all this because, well, it\\'s that kind of film.And that\\'s fine, when the film does as much as this one to keep you diverted. That\\'s all you get here, and all you really need. I mean, if you are going to watch a film called \"Charlie\\'s Angels,\" you shouldn\\'t expect tight plotting and stuff. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. I did.\"', '\"Jeffrey Wright. Man, Jeffrey Wright! He\\'s the man and always will be at least as far as this film is concerned. It\\'s a miracle that this film worked out as good as it did, because let\\'s face it: John Singleton is a hack. I haven\\'t seen Boyz N the Hood, but his other films haven\\'t impressed me at all. 2 Fast 2 Furious was a glass of water when it should\\'ve been scotch on the rocks. Higher learning had potential, but ended up being corny. The list goes on. Now Shaft.. it works.Samuel L. Jackson is no doubt good in the title role, but Wright gives such an energetic performance as Peoples that it casts a dark shadow on everybody else. In a world with justice he would\\'ve been at least nominated for an Oscar. But no. Also Christian Bale turns in a great performance as the stuck up racist rich kid. Sparks fly when he and Wright share the screen.Shaft is a good and entertaining little actioner. It didn\\'t make me regret spending 90 minutes of my life on watching it.**** / *****\"', '\"10 superfluously pointlessly wasted minutes of my time, 6 bits of inane dialogue, 4 instances of Not-Even-Hollywood-Believable cinematography, 1 huge bit of \\'Exclusive Advertising Contract\\', not to mention the other 115 minutes of my pointlessly wasted time (above and beyond all the usual Hollywood \"Cars Do Not explode when you shoot them!\") I thought I\\'d seen Cruise at his worst in \"Eyes Wide Shut\"; I was wrong.

I became much more interesting in cars(specially tuning them) after watching \\'\\'The Fast and the Furious\\'\\'and a whole new world have become a reality to me. Vin Diesel is awesome and hot (as usual)as the character Toretto,the respected leader of a famous street gang that is under suspicion of stealing expensive electronic equipments.

A great capping off of the series such as Die Another Day! The adventure starts off with Pierce\\' betrayal and imprisonment for 14 months, as we see him abused and tortured during the \"bond\" opening sequence credits under the much hated(I personally love this song) Die Another Day by Madonna. From this point, we are sent to follow James across the globe, with his licence to kill revoked, hes a rogue agent in search for his betrayer to seek vengeance upon. We are treated to the usual cast, as well as Halle Berry as Bonds counterpart, (mmmmmmmm daddy likes) and Rosemund pike as the COLD Ms. Frost. Toby Stevens does a great job as the villain \"Gustov Graves\" and \"Zao\" is fantastic! Overall, without giving too much away, this movie is truly the mark of what has worked in bond before, but as you can see by other reviewers, what no longer works.After watching the movie over this past weekend, I realized it was made to end the Bond we all know. Every \"James Bond\" movie after Die Another Day will be a new James we haven\\'t seen before. Every movie from Dr. No to die Another Day will no longer mean anything and \"James bond\" will be earning his 00 status in the new film \"casino royale\" Die Another day has everything we all loved about James Bond movies so why does it get such a bad wrap? Lets see. Attractive bond girls? check. \"Villian to take over the world? check. Tons of OTT action? check. New Gadgets to get the job done? check. So whats the problem?OK now we come to the bad parts of the film. (which are totally overlook able) We will start with the only gripe i have. The direction. If this movie did not have the Matrix-Style cut scenes, it would have been THE bond movie of all time. (IMO) the effects. Yes some of these (maybe only the surfing ice scene) had bad cgi effects. How many bond movies of the past had bad \"bluescreen\" effects? I lost count(though none made the movies less enjoyable) so in my own words, who cares! The only other problem i read about is how the story is recycled. For those who didn\\'t know, this movie serves more as a shrine to previous bond films, and references many old scenes(some ppl like this some ppl don\\'t. I love it!) I could see when Pierce read this that he didn\\'t like the script. I can only assume this one, but in my opinion, he was reading the script and saw the end of his run as 007. And what a run at that!So don\\'t listen to all the bad hype surrounding this movie and watch it with a new perspective. The last \"true\" bond film! All bond movies have maybe one or two things we don\\'t like, but the rest is awesome. This movie fits the bill in every way. More along the lines of a \"moore\" bond film, but maybe thats why I loved it so much! Rated 9 out of 10. By the way, to those who talk about the invisible car \"takin it too far\" gimme a break!!! So James can have a car that turns into a sub, (in one of the most beloved bonds TSWLM) but not invisible(which is a reality, just not to the extent they show in the film) And you call yourselves TRUE James bond fans? I think not!\"', '\"I thought it would be like Rush Hour, but I thought Shanghai Noon is better. The movie was funny and had great action.  Owen Wilson did a good job as an outlaw and both Wilson and Chan had great chemistry.  Lucy Lui did a great job as a strong Chinese Princess.  If you are a Jackie Chan fan and you are out for some action and comedy this is the movie for you.

The movie is filmed greatly! The music is great by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard! Just great directing by John Woo! He is one of My favorites! This is My favorite of the Mission: Impossible series so far! the movie takes a new a direction with Woo on board! I love the scenes when Niya takes the Chimra, the confrontation with Hunt and Ambrose, and the fight between Hunt and Ambrose! When Niya injects herself this is the scene that changes the rest of the movie in My opinion! It just awesome and Zimmer\\'s and Gerrard\\'s score makes it so good!

The pitch meeting musthave gone something like, \"It\\'s the Spice Girls meet the Matrix!\"This film is definitely rooted in 2000, and was made with acompletely contemporary sensibility.

I hear Cruise did his stunts...if this is true the man is a true action hero warrior, able to defy gravity and reality at times.The only compliant is the love story.

Grade: B+\"', '\"My feelings towards Die Another Day are quite mixed. As a piece of entertainment, I rank it quite highly. As per the dictates of the \\'Bond plot structure\\', it does sag a little bit in the middle after an explosive beginning and before a similarly dramatic ending, but there are enough action set-pieces to keep the film flowing more smoothly than any other Brosnan-era Bond film. However, technically the film has serious deficiencies which prevent me from appraising the film in an especially glowing light. In a sense this film reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s Commando, insofar as the deficient technical quality and over-the-top entertainment balance each other out.One serious deficiency is the plot. There are some promising elements: the topic of choice (North Korean renegades causing mischief) is quite topical if not especially original and there are plenty of twists and turns throughout. If nothing else the plot keeps you on its toes. It is also not afraid to poke fun at itself (Bond\\'s reaction to the invisible car) and its references to prior Bond films are actually quite subtle and clever at times.However, the plot also lacks logic and restraint. For instance, the notion of a North Korean transforming himself into your everyday Caucasian through the magic of gene therapy stretches credibility even for a Bond film. It is also not properly explained how someone can possibly change their entire appearance, create a new identity and form a successful, world-renowned diamond company within the span of just 14 months. Would such an individual\\'s past not lead to scrutiny? Other plot devices range from flawed (Brosnan\\'s complete and quick mental/physical recovery from being tortured, plus why wouldn\\'t Zao have his most distinguishing feature removed first if he wanted to disguise himself?), to laughable (a character named Mr. Kil, the goofy power suit), to just plain unbecoming for a Bond film (the invisible car, with its sci-fi overtones).The dialogue similarly lacks restraint. It was as if the screenwriters recognised that Bond\\'s penchant for double entendres and witty quips was one of the series\\' defining features and so decided that the audience would love it if conversations were crammed with them. However, excess soon renders such repartee tiresome. Jinx\\'s references to her own nickname were also gratuitous while her blaxploitation one-liners don\\'t really suit a Bond film.The direction also warrants some opprobrium. The camera angles and frequent cuts at times make it more difficult to comprehend what is happening, especially during the action scenes. The CGI shots also look surprisingly cheap and tacky at times (notably the infamous Brosnan surfing scene) given how lavish and expensive the production was. The choice of theme song was also uninspired given its autotuned mien and...unusual...lyrical matter.Additionally, the acting warrants some criticism. Brosnan himself is in fine form as always, bringing a suave, sophisticated air to the otherwise somewhat silly proceedings. However, Halle Berry is saddled with a poorly-written character and so is difficult to take seriously as Bond\\'s equal beyond her physical appearance. Stephens tries to inject some vigour into proceedings but the premise behind his character and his power suit just make him look ridiculous instead of being a menace. Madsen is an awkward fit as Jinx\\'s NSA boss given his past roles. Rick Yune and Will Yun Lee are pretty chilling but they are also underused, while Madonna\\'s appearance is nothing more than stunt casting. Rosamund Pike fares better, cultivating an icy personality that is not overly weighed down by double entendres, while Judi Dench allows some sympathetic moments to creep into her otherwise stern personality. John Cleese firing barbs at Bond is also a welcome sight.In summary, Die Another Day is more entertaining than any other Brosnan-era Bond film due to its explosive action scenes and plot twists. However, the film almost collapses under the weight of its technical faults. By all means see this film, if only to understand why the franchise was rebooted, but don\\'t expect a masterpiece.3/5 stars\"', '\"Wow!  What a load of c**p!  I didn\\'t think it was possible, but this movie is even worse than the TV show!  The plot is beyond stupid--to be totally honest I can\\'t really remember it.  Anyways, it\\'s just an excuse to have Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz get into VERY tight outfits and prance around.  I\\'m really surprised this film got a PG--there\\'s so much flesh shown on these girls!  It goes VERY close to an R more than once. Also the jokes are very stupid--one of them has Liu being a lousy cook!  I thought that stereotype disappeared in the \\'50s!  As for the acting--Lynch is very good in her role; Bill Murray looks miserable; Barrymore looks confused; Liu can\\'t act; Matt LeBlanc (as Liu\\'s boyfriend) is basically playing Joey from \"Friends\" and Tom Green is REALLY annoying as Barrymore\\'s boyfriend.  Only Cameron Diaz gives out a good performance--she\\'s so lively and fun.  Also Luke Wilson is very good as her boyfriend.  Those two have great chemistry together.  So, I gave the film a 4 only for Diaz, Wilson and some good fight scenes.  Otherwise, this is a mess.\"', '\"I didn\\'t bother going to the movie theater to see this movie. I thought it was going to be a chick flick so I even hesitated to rent it. Boy was I suprised. This movie isn\\'t serious and doesn\\'t mean to be. It\\'s just comic entertainment. Guys would enjoy this movie because it has plenty of action, sex, and special f/x. If you rent this movie I guarantee that you won\\'t be disappointed. I thought that this movie might be a bomb but is is very entertaining. The girls are real funny and the special effects just add to the enjoyment. This movie is hip and great for the young audience.\"', '\"The beginning of \"Die Another Day\" is much darker in tone than most of its predecessors, apart from \"Licence to Kill\" which was a violent revenge thriller masquerading as a Bond film. On a mission to North Korea Bond is captured after being betrayed, thrown into prison and tortured. He is eventually released in exchange for a North Korean terrorist named Zao, but discovers that his superior \"M\" has only agreed to the exchange because she believes that he has cracked under torture and has given away information to the North Koreans. (In her previous outings, Judi Dench\\'s \"M\" was played as a relatively liberal figure, but here her ideology is one of cynical Realpolitik). After about the first twenty minutes, however, the film reverts to a standard Bond movie. Bond escapes from MI6 custody in order to uncover the real source of information and to hunt down the dangerous Zao. He discovers that there may be links between the North Koreans and Gustav Graves, a mysterious British industrialist who has made a fortune after discovering a major source of diamonds in Iceland, and has perfected a solar-powered laser that can be used as a dangerous weapon.This was the last of the Pierce Brosnan Bonds, and in my view the weakest, although its weaknesses have little to do with its star. Although Brosnan is visibly older than he was in \"Goldeneye\", at 49 he is still trim and fit enough to be a convincing secret agent and he always manages to preserve the vital balance between sardonic humour and the sense of being a dangerous man of action. His performances in the role did not deteriorate with age in the way that Roger Moore\\'s did. (Perhaps the reason was that Moore attempted to continue in the role until he was nearly sixty). Its weakness also has nothing to do with the leading lady, the lovely Halle Berry. She makes her character Jinx, a smart, streetwise and sexy American secret agent, one of the best Bond heroines of recent years, probably the best with the possible exception of Michelle Yeoh\\'s Wai Lin in \"Tomorrow Never Dies\".Not all the performances are so good. Rosamund Pike, who plays the secondary Bond girl, the treacherous MI6 agent Miranda Frost, has the looks to suggest the glacial beauty implied by her character\\'s surname, but in manner she is too hesitant and soft-spoken to seem really threatening. Madonna\\'s horrible theme song was by far the worst of any Bond film. The film\\'s main weakness, however, is that the film-makers seemed to be running out of ideas. To celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the franchise they studded it with references to all the previous Bond films. (Jinx, for example, emerges from the sea wearing a bikini similar to that worn by Ursula Andress in \"Dr No\"). The title is clearly modelled on \"Live and Let Die\" (just as \"Goldeneye\" was modelled on \"Goldfinger\"), with a possible reference to \"Tomorrow Never Dies\". The importance of diamonds to the plot is taken from \"Diamonds are Forever\". The film should have been awarded the Oscar for Most Ecologically Friendly Script, as most of the storyline consists of used plots recycled from previous Bond movies. Graves, for example, is a reincarnation of numerous earlier villains from Auric Goldfinger, via Stromberg, Drax and Max Zorin, to Elliott Carver. He is not the most memorable of Bond villains, but this has less to do with the way Toby Stevens plays the part than with the fact that sinister megalomaniac tycoons have become all too familiar in Bond films.The North Korean angle in the film never really seemed convincing. Kim Jong-Il\\'s strange Marxist monarchy may be, together with Cuba (also featured here), one of the last outposts of Communist tyranny, a sort of political elephant\\'s graveyard where worn-out old ideologies go to die, but it is also too much of an impoverished, famine-stricken backwater to pose any serious military threat to the West.It is perhaps a good thing that there have been no Bond films for the last four years. On the evidence of \"Die Another Day\" history seems to be repeating itself. In the late seventies and eighties the series was in trouble with a number of weak plots which the producers attempted to disguise unsuccessfully by the over-use of hi-tech gadgetry. The re-launch of the franchise with the early Brosnan films in the nineties was a success, but the series now seems to be stagnating again. The use of gimmicks like that invisible car (far-fetched even by the standards of Bond gadgets), the elaborate ice-palace and a man with a diamond-studded face cannot prevent the film from looking over-familiar. The break, coupled with the introduction of Daniel Craig to bring a fresh approach to 007, may mean that the series will be in better shape when it returns. 6/10\"', '\"The Sum of All Fears (2002)A bit of cold war redux. It\\'s patched together, not quite incoherent (as some reviews on its release claimed) but one thing does not necessarily lead to another. The lead CIA dude in charge is a typically dull Ben Affleck (however hard he tries), and too much depends on him at times to really work. The plot, for 2002, is thick and thicker, dredging up both 1960s Cold War fears and WWII Nazi anger, too. At times you want to throw up your hands and just say, stop!You can\\'t argue against high drama for its own sake, I suppose--love, loyalty, a stadium full of innocents, Israel and the Ukraine and Langley and a pair of firmly reasonable Russian and American leaders. It has the makings of a serious movie, the Tom Clancy basis notwithstanding (he\\'s an airport novelist at best), but it has too many fault lines and strained effects. And it pushes its drama like a hungry pig at the trough. Note the ending, if nothing else, for proof--not the cutesy part about the engagement, but the five minutes before that, a kind of homage to the famous wedding sequence in \"The Godfather\" where two opposite plots and sentiments are aligned in classic parallel editing.This isn\\'t quite a disaster of a film. It has some neat movie-making moments, like the way they recreate the high secrecy of the Defense Department, or the brief atomic bomb sequences. Morgan Freeman seems to be convincing as anything he wants to be in film, and he is a central high point again and again. In fact, the movie takes off when he first appears, and it disintegrates when his role is done. Liev Schrieber can be wonderful and he\\'s strong here, but isn\\'t given enough rope to make his character have distinction. Taking all this further, I think it is at times an insulting movie, making schlock out of the most fearsome and serious of 20th Century issues. You also invariably remember the great Cold War films straight out of the cold war, like \"Fail-Safe\" and \"The Bedford Incident\" among several others, all of which have the horror and terrifying lack of control intact. And of course to bring out the Nazis again (as so many films do, I guess because we have a cultural hatred of them that\\'s still draws water at the well) is just too much. Not that they don\\'t exist, but that they don\\'t contribute here.I wouldn\\'t waste my time in particular, but if you are stick in Baltimore in a motel room and this comes on, you might, possibly, do worse.\"', '\"Wow, was this movie a total piece of crap. Boring, stupid actors driving in bright, ugly cars. There are so many things wrong with this movie I do not even know where to begin. Every performance in this movie was flat and drab. The dialog was beyond stupid. I know Van can do better than this. The cars and stunts fail to impress because you will not give a shit about these people. If you want to see a better movie about similar ideas, see \"No Man\\'s Land\". For really good car scenes, watch \"Ronin\". Instead of \"The Fast and the Furious\", how about \"The Dumb and the Boring\"\"', '\"Ethan Hunt is back with another theoretically impossible mission. Tom Cruise once again delivered at least a satisfactory performance, along with all other actors involved, but John Woo\\'s direction was a little bit excessive at some points. I fail to see what made it necessary for Hunt to be riding his motorcycle on the front wheel while firing at an oncoming car. Or how about that gun that was lying in the sand toward the end of the film? Was that a little too unrealistic, or was it just me?The story was good, the acting was convincing enough, and the action sequences were well put together, but they were just too much. One of the other things that really saved this film from action-packed obscurity was some very clever and well placed dialogue, particularly on the part of Ving Rhames, back once again as Luther Stickell (\"Ethan! Nyah is in the building! Do you copy!\")Despite M:I 2\\'s shortcoming\\'s, it will undoubtedly be very satisfying to the true action fan. It has explosions, gun fights, car chases, lethal viruses, Jackie Chan style fight scenes, and even a hint of a few WWF moves in those fights. Mission: Impossible 2 is a good action film. I was not tremendously impressed, but I also didn\\'t feel like I had just wasted two hours.

I\\'m a big fan of the Clancy books and a bigger fan than most of the Jack Ryan movies, unfortunately this one falls a bit flat and only a couple of the subplots redeem things.I knew going into the theater about the revamping of the Ryan character so as to de-age him, and that had me greatly worried about how things would play out in regards to sticking with the book. My fears, I think, were mostly realized. The movie severs ties with most of the heart and soul of the book. Sure there\\'s the bombing of the superbowl, but it lacks the same portrayal of Jack. Sum of All Fears, the novel, had him pinned against a corner, he\\'s being ousted from his job by Liz Elliot and President Fowler, he\\'s having troubles in bed, his marriage is in near shambles with his wife thinking he might be cheating on him, and it takes faith from his wife and a little help from his friends to get through it. That\\'s gone. While the new love blossoming is a nice approach, it\\'s been done...this one was about a man hitting rock bottom by being hit from all sides and yet still able to recover, and it\\'s not there. And I realize it\\'s impossible to condense a 900 page book into a 2 1/2 hour movie without losing things. I\\'m not complaining of that, if I were I\\'d be whining about them changing the tank battle in the middle of Germany to the launching of planes instead. But aside from a few key plot elements kept, the movie lost a good deal of the essence of the book.The backstory is rushed along so as to get us to the bomb detonation in a fairly quick manner, and yet at the same time, I felt my rear falling asleep as it somehow managed to drag nonetheless. Now I understand the need to get to the bombing and the tense standoff, as that did take up the focus of the movie, but the first 45 mins or so felt lacking of purpose, spinning its wheels at times.Now there is definite redemption. Everything that happens after the initial showing of the Superbowl stadium was enjoyable. (The Florida Gators in the superbowl was a nice touch)...well let me take that back, having Talbot die in the airplane seemed a bit silly and out of place. It was a nice attempt at keeping certain aspects of the book in...but it just came off as them trying to shove more ties to the book because they felt they were lacking than it did to serve any purpose to progressing the movie.The individual characters did an excellent job, Ben Affleck makes a good young Jack Ryan, and I look forward to more by him. While this is one of the lesser of the Jack Ryan films, it\\'s not due to the cast. I enjoyed Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, more than Alec Baldwin. The supporting characters did extremely well with their characters, especially some of the smaller ones.Morgan Freeman was top notch, that\\'s all there is to say on that, he\\'s nothing less than his amazingly talented career would lead you to believe. He provided the majority of the humor of the movie, much to Jack Ryan\\'s chagrin.As for what else was good? The minor story arcs with Clark and the end with Spinnaker. The only other thing I enjoyed was the use of overhead photography to show the different locations for the movie. I thought that was a nice touch.6 out of 10. Wait for it on home video, you\\'re not missing much. A good deal of individual excellence that just doesn\\'t quite seem to meld properly to make a good movie.\"', '\"A really fun film with a stellar cast. George Clooney and Brad Pitt for the girls and the lovely Julia Roberts for the boys. I must admit I have never seen the original film but I did enjoy this remake. Andy Garcia is perfect as the hardnosed, \"no messin\\'\" casino owner who gets on the wrong side of ex jailbird Clooney enough for him to plot to rip off his casino and steal back his girlfriend. There are many laughs and mishaps on the way and its fun watching clooneys clever plan unfold. Recommended.\"', '\"How can you go wrong with all of the elements that this movie had.  Great cast (Morgan Freeman and Ben Aflleck), Great plot (save the world), and all the extras such as good CGI.  This movie will hold you in suspense, make you laugh, and touch your heart.  This movie was well worth the ticket.  It had some originality and unpredictability to it.  I fully enjoyed the latest in the jack ryan movies believe that it even surpassed it\\'s predecessors.\"', '\"HUMOUR? ________ The extended passages that are meant to be witty reparte in sexual innuendo is Jurassic poo from the Benny Hill School of humour The moral of the story; drop two lame double entendres and you\\'re in bed with Halle Berry (Academy Award Winner 2002 tm)DIALOGUE ________ Based on the lack of credibility the acting is quite servicable but cannot rise above the lines that pretend to be witty. It almost rivals Star Wars - Attack of the clones in terms of turgid dialogue; `I love you.   pull my finger\\' This is not the fault of the actors but the writers trying to fit in three bad sexual innuendos instead of one witty one. Obviously they don\\'t get laid in real life so they have to compensate for this in virtual realityBOND WOMEN ________ In this film the Bond Women tm. must either be saved, serviced, or killed. If they are too old then they are just hard bitches with BAFTA Awards. The support role of Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) is reduced to a weak plot device and another notch in Bond\\'s bedpost - it hardly a flattering role to look pretty and carry a sword. It\\'s easy for Halle Berry to look sexy but her performance is weak - she has no real material to work from. Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies may not be as sexy as Halle Berry but you can actually believe that she is the real deal. The females in this film looked like models that were told to hold a sword or pistol and look good with a fan blowing in their hair.Just swing your hips in slow motion - it\\'s good for the multiple cross-promotional commercials for Revlon. In this film the young females are nothing more than eye candy due to the weak writing.CLOSE - TOO CLOSE FOR CREDIBILITY ________ Bond and Jinx have several chances to kill Zao and Graves but they throw them away before you can say `Look behind you!\\'. Like `Scream\\' we see Bond and Jinx with a 100% kill option for the most dangerous enemies in the film. End Result: a fist fight or getting captured. In `Scream\\' we see the girl in a bikini at a cross roads between `Escape Route\\' and `Certain death\\' and the bimbo always picks the later option - why does this kind of stupidity occur in a Bond film?VULNERABLE? ________ I am invincible! - (Goldeneye) Give the baddie a machine gun mounted on a Jaguar - give Bond an invisible bulletproof car - where is the real jeopardy?HOMAGES or WEAK REPRODUCTIONS with no twist ________ This film is recycling at its worst - nothing new just churning old ideas. Lame homages to previous bond films include the;Q gadgets, Diamonds forever satelite frickin\\' `laser beam\\', Having a dual with the bad guy in incognito over over a gold bar or in this case a diamond, Frickin\\' `Laser beam\\' torture, Getting sucked out of the windows of a depressurised airplane,Halle Berry pretending to be Ursula Andress.It\\'s good to see the old Bond scenes replayed from the old movies with a few cosmetic changes but to not improve on them or add a decent twist is just plain boring and lazy! I know - we\\'ll have 5 frikin\\' laser beams instead of 1, and 5 evil Asian men get sucked out of the airplane instead of one fat German one - now that\\'s an improvement over the previous 19 films!ANTI CLIMAX ________ The finale between good and evil is a fistfight on an airplane (the Goldfinger homage quota is fulfilled) Where is the excitement? Gone is the wit / intelligence and style. It becomes a Arnold Swartzennegger muscle fest from the 80\\'s.Henchman Zao - is the only real bad guy who gives Bond a run for his money. He gets killed too easy in the anti climactic car chase. In the film it\\'s the closest thing Bond gets to an evil rival but really it boils down to gadget vs more gadgets and he gets killed off well before the `big ending\\'At least the car chase had a few good and visual ideas ie. Ejector seat flipping the car as seen in ALL the promos; (Way to go markerting department - show all the best bits in the ads to guarantee a let down in the cinemas - you\\'ve got your money now.)CHARACTERS ________ All the characters have a distinct lack of motivation A bad guy who cannot go to sleep because he has changed his DNA - not much was made of this fact - maybe he has to do things faster but really this doesn\\'t add up to a hill of beans and they don\\'t bother following this through. Why was Miranda Frost a double agent - something to do with winning gold at fencing at the Olympics (?!) or was it because Evil Incorportated offered her a new makeup line that was to die for in cross promotions.BOND FOR THE FUTURE ________ I suspect this is a Bond pitched at wider market of younger and less discerning teens.In so doing this I believe they will sacrifice the older audience who prefer to rent video rather than go out and see the film in theatres. If Eon productions continue on this route the following film sales will hurt in the longer term.With this film they\\'re drawing in both young and old. That won\\'t be the case if they follow this new formula for the next couple of rounds - there will be a definite backlash. The public can only be had a couple of times before they avoid the Bond Franchise and write it off as a farce from the 80s.What I want to see in Bond? If I ruled my world I\\'d like to see more - style, wit, innovation, a litle more mind over muscle. Now they have the money they have run out of ideas and want to play it safe with reruns.I have an idea. How about an even bigger `Frickin\\' laser beam shot from the moon, which we shall call the `Death Star\\' Any takers? Anybody?Jacy (Evil jr) Teh\"', '\"great effects with tom cruise doing some incredible stunts delightful special effects and fast paced action but the story line is totally rubbish and really should not have bothered as this storyline has been repeated in so many different films that it is really predictable this film is very james bondesque but worth seeing just for the amazing effects and action\"', '\"This movie is wonderful. It\\'s funny, exciting, and warm hearted. Jackie Chan is amazing, and his brand of stunt acrobatics really travels well. The guy who played his partner was also great-- he reminded me of what president Bill Clinton might have been like if he was a young cowboy back in America\\'s 1880s. Rave comments for everything! Go see it-- you\\'ll love it. I gave this a 10 out of 10.\"', '\"The first Men in Black is a great film, I mean its just got a good \"feel\" to it. The sequel? It loses that \"feel\".Spoilers:5 years have passed since the first film and J is still a hothead. Great character development, huh?K works at a mail office after getting divorced from his wife. See? Some people should fake being in comatose states.Evil plant alien, Surlina, (played by Lara Flynn Boyle)is boring and cliche, but at least she\\'s hot.She easily takes over MIB HQ and gathers up evil alien henchmen, who are very dangerous, yet as soon as K\\'s back, he easily beats all of them in under a minute\\'s time. J also beats an arch nemesis easily too.Next, there\\'s of course J\\'s love interest who just happens to be key to the whole evil plot. Big shock huh? Of course in the end the good guys beat Surlina and save the day. As for the love story, it so tragic because they can\\'t be with each other. Boo-hoo.End SpoilersThe only thing saving this movie from absolute garbage, is tons of great one-liners and plenty of comedic gags, especially from Patrick Warburton who is defiantly not in the movie long enough.\"', '\"...than I or 99% of the population will ever know. Steven Soderbergh\\'s remake of the Ratpack\\'s prior outing is a weightless exercise in cool for the new millennium. The entire cast are nearly flawless contributors to this effort, but Clooney, Pitt, Damon, and Reiner really outdo themselves. Wardrobes, locations, and the soundtrack all complement the actors and plot superbly. In the future I can only hope to dress half as well as Pitt and Clooney do in this film. The soundtrack is an outstandingly modern and refreshing blend of jazz and electronica that is used to great effect throughout the film\\'s varied scenes.I also admired the dialog and its delivery throughout the film. November\\'s \\'Heist\\' delivered excellent dialog, but at many points the delivery was forced and it became hard to believe so many people delivering so many one-liners one after the other. In \\'Ocean\\'s 11\\' the humor in the dialog is superbly employed to break the tension developed in certain scenes. I would imagine a great deal of this difference is the product of Mamet and Soderbergh\\'s differing styles of writing and directing.Those reading this may believe I am excessively exuberant about this film and they would be correct in that belief. I cannot recall a single film that put such a huge smile on my face for nearly two hours.I do have one nitpick with the film, but it is extremely minor and probably due to my slight fatigue as I viewed the film. As others have mentioned the film can be a bit slow in spots. Modern audiences may have this feeling after being exposed to years of crowd-pleasing explosions and effects wizardry. When seeing this film it is important to remember Ocean\\'s is a HEIST film rather than an ACTION film. In the end, I found it very satisfying to watch the well-planned and executed heist develop with a minimum of violence and no deaths!Others may gripe regarding the \\'Pinch\\' device, but militaries around the world have been researching these units since the \\'80s and are working to bring them into active service as I write. However, the packaging of the device in the movie was certainly more fanciful than the olive drab that would be used by a defense arm.In summary, Clooney and Co. explode the mystique of the Ratpack, redefine \\'cool\\' for the third millennium, and manage to put a huge smile on my face while doing so. Easily 11/10\"', '\"The basic premise of the plot is a lot like many James Bond movies. The bad guys try to provoke a war between the US and Russia, so what is new. Apart from the major holes that have been mentioned in this site i.e. your cell phone and email machine will not work after an atomic blast and the picnic in White house lawn after a nuclear blast less than 40 miles away is not very pleasant, technically the film is not bad. U understand in the book the terrorists are Arabs and change was done for Political correctness. I do not find this very objectionable. If there are neo-fascists around, I presume they are capable of such actions. One can imagine European McVeighs with a lot of money are a lot less detectable than a bunch of Arabs trying to buy or sell nuclear arms.\"', '\"I love action and thriller movies probably more than any other type of movie and I would have to say that \"The Sum Of All Fears\" is probably one of the best that I have ever seen. Usually during every movie, even action films, there is a spot in the movie that is boring. During this movie I did not feel bored during a single scene. Many people are complaining about Ben Affleck playing Ryanm, but I can not think of a person that could have played the CIA analyst any better. i would have to agree with others that Harrison Ford is way to old for the role. He\\'s almost sixty!! All I can say now is that everyone has different opinions on the movie, but it was entertaining throughout and I highly reccomend it.\"', '\"Imagine Rush Hour (martial arts) mixed with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (outlaw cowboy), and that gives you an idea of what to expect with this fun to watch western action comedy, from director Tom Dey (Failure to Launch). Basically it is the 19th Century, and Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is kidnapped from her the Forbidden City in her home country, and it is the strict duty and personal responsibility of Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) to get her back, well, with the other three guys, but forget them. On his journey in Nevada, in the U.S., he meets outlaw cowboy Roy O\\'Bannon (Owen Wilson), originally a near bad guy, with no like of violence or anything nasty, but he is soon finding himself wanting to help his new \"partner\". Oh, by the way, the bad guy is Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), a traitor of Wang\\'s home country, and he is obviously wanting a priceless amount of gold as ransom. Also starring Brandon Merrill as Indian wife, Candyman\\'s Xander Berkeley as Van Cleef, Walton Goggins as Wallace, Adrien P. Dorval as Blue, Rafael BÃ¡ez as Vasquez and Jason Connery as Andrews. Chan gets his stunts and fighting sequences, and Wilson gets his witty dialogue and gun play, and Liu gets to look glamorous, in a pretty entertaining film. Worth watching!\"', '\"unfortunately, the movie wasn\\'t supposed 2 be a comedy. so cheesy. whatever happened to the days where james bond fought communists with a martini and his own charms? now he needs an invisible car?! u expect james bond 2 be unrealistic but this one was just ridiculously bad. i couldnt stop laughing!\"', '\"After I had seen the awful re-make of the old TV-show \"The Avengers\", I had my doubts about \"CharlieÂ´s Angels\". Do we really need to see another forgotten classic remade for the new generation? Apparently, we did.Three beautiful special agents, Natalie, Dylan and Alex, works for a mysterious man named Charlie, and together they go by the name of CharlieÂ´s Angels. They save the world from all kinds of troubles, and this time they are going to save the important man Eric Knox, but things are not quite what the angels expected.If you can forget about the silly plot, and just look at the cool action sequences and the amusing dialogue, you are in for a treat. The movie looks really good, with great special effects and the girls look drop dead gorgeous in all their different and stylish outfits. And the fact that they almost always behave like a bunch of naive schoolgirls, and the next second they do some serious ass kicking, only makes the movie funnier. The soundtrack is a killer, with everything from DestinyÂ´s Child to Prodigy in it. Diaz, Barrymore and Liu are all very sexy as the angels, and even if they are clearly no comedians, they provide some laughs. Bill Murray is as adorable as always, this time as Bosley, who helps the angels when it is needed. The villains are also charismatic, especially Crispin GloverÂ´s \"The Thin Man\", which is very important for a popcorn movie like this.\\nBut you canÂ´t deny that the script is pretty stupid and gradually I found myself somewhat tired of the angelsÂ´ clever remarks. Add three unfunny cameos by LL Cool J, Matt LeBlanc and Tom Green, and you realize that \"CharlieÂ´s Angels\" is not perfect. But it does have some funny and trivial jokes, for example: Matt LeBlancÂ´s character is a lousy actor, just like he is as Joey in the sitcom \"Friends\".\\n\"CharlieÂ´s Angels\" is an enjoyable experience, if you can forget about the plot, that is. * * * Â½ out of * * * * *\"', '\"I watched both of the movies and i hope that they are going to do another one.What i love in this movie is the humor.Really funny movie.I think it is better than the first one.Now about the movie.The earth is in danger because a alien with skin of human is looking for the light of Zartha.The Light of Zarta is a item that has the power to destroy the world.Will Smith has a new partner but he is very dumb and he does\\'t feel like a different human.Agent Jay neutralize him and now he does\\'t have a partner.The need of Agent Kay becomes bigger because he is the only one who knows about the light of Zartha.This is a part of the plot.The movie is also funnier than the first one.There is a talking dog a talking stupid worms and more adventures in this great sci-fi comedy movie.\"', '\"Clooney and company are a joy to watch, their gleeful chemistry almost oozing from the screen, and where the film takes inspiration from seminal works like \\'The Sting (1973)\\' is in its frequent desire to bait-and-switch the audience, to keep them in the dark and gleefully surprise them at every turn. It\\'s this aspect and this fun approach to \\'Ocean\\'s Eleven (2001)\\' that makes watching the film so entertaining, like an untaxing puzzle to be unravelled as it goes along, and its easy-going attitude makes for a laid-back watch with some twists to keep you on your toes and great character writing to keep a smile on your face. 7/10\"', '\"This film is great.  very funny, it has some great fight scenes in it, fantastic characters.  and is not, as my esteemed commentor says, the same old thing.  Yes, it is a buddy movie and a fish out of water movie, but in so many other ways it is unique.I never really planned to watch it, i had not heard anything too good about it, in fact, had read the reviews on here and decided it was not worth watching.  but i caught the ending on sky movies and it kinda made me smile, so the next time it was shown, i watched it and loved it. \\nDont watch this film with any pre-conceived ideas or compare it to any other movie.

Paul walkers eyes are so pricing blue though wow..... like i said those movies are very awesome also has a beautiful smile too he has done a great job on every movie..Mia played a good role too all of the cast did a good job\"', '\"I would honestly say Daniel Craig made one or two good Bond movies, the first one being the best. Brosnan was always consistent and never soured on the series.Die Another Day gets a bad rap from some of the snottier types out there. It really wasn\\'t that bad. The invisible car gets a lot of flack in spite of the fact that anyone keeping up with science magazines and tech blogs knew it was experimented on. In fact, with OLED technology and tiny modern HD cameras, it wouldn\\'t be implausible to see another try with the tech. I see a lot of people erroneously moaning that it was science fiction when it really wasn\\'t.As for the rest of the plot, I didn\\'t like the actor who played the villain and there were accusations of whitewashing, but it fit really well into the plot but I think a lot of people couldn\\'t get past it. The scene where the father disowned him was pretty pivotal but that flew over the heads of a lot of people, apparently.Around this time, Halle Berry was big, arrogant and self-aware, which hurt the production. It\\'s hard to cast American women in Bond movies because they are very low-class to the point that they stick out like a sore thumb. Some part of me thinks it\\'s intentional because it\\'s very rare to see an American woman in a Bond movie that isn\\'t absolutely awkward. There really was Teri Hatcher, to be honest.A lot of people don\\'t want to admit this was a pretty good Bond movie. It definitely started the series on a darker path. I like to rewatch it now and then, don\\'t worry care about anyone that bashes it.\"', '\"I really liked this movie. I\\'ve figured out that I love heist movies recently, so my expectations for this were really high. As you know the outcome was me really liking it. It had good characters, a good story line rapped around the heist of the casino, and awesome, intense parts of the movie. It was very enjoyable, but I was starting to doubt it at the beginning...For almost an hour the movie, was very slow, and I didn\\'t like that. It actually bored me for a while. I understood that it was a buildup to the big casino-robbing scene, but I still thing they could have done it better. Part of the first hour was the main characters getting some people to help them rob the casino. That was of it was a little entertaining, but still kind of boring. At the beginning of the movie, it kind of illustrated why Ocean wanted to rob the casinos, and that was interesting. I\\'m glad that they did that. But, all in all, the first half of the movie was pretty boring, so the second half really had to make up for that. And... It did.The second half was pretty much just awesome. Almost all of it was the casino-robbing scene and the scenes where they practiced for it. Even the scenes where they practiced for it were pretty cool and interesting. You figure out why Ocean decides to use those people. And they really do practice for it in those scenes. They make sure they\\'ll get it right. Now for the casino-robbing part. The first about 10 minutes of it were interesting, but I think could have been a little better. At that point I had no idea what the rest of the movie would be like. It could have started to be really bad, but it could have gone to be awesome. It went to be awesome. I loved the casino-robbing scene after the first 10 minutes. Even though the first 10 minutes had some cool tricks that Ocean and his people used to get past things, the rest of it was completely awesome. I loved what they did at the end to finish robbing the casino, but before that...There were several clever tricks they used, even more clever than the first few tricks, and even some things went wrong. I don\\'t want to talk about the ending too much, but at the end there\\'s one of the coolest and most intense twist at the end that takes brain power to understand. So 8/10 in my rating system means I really liked the movie. I thought it was really good.\"', '\"In terms of the profile of the performers involved and the money spent on its production, this film seems to be a minor picture in comparison to the megabucks blockbusters the studios release. However, considering it was made by a major studio and apes the style of the blockbusters, you can\\'t really call this an Independent picture either. It seems the best way to define this movie is as a B-Movie, changes in film convention and monetary inflation notwithstanding.This is not intended to devalue the film - Assault on Precinct 13, New Jack City and some of the best movies of the 1940s were B-movies. All it means is it doesn\\'t have stars and doesn\\'t pretend to be a particularly original work of art, and would consider itself a success if enough people buy tickets for it to make its money back. Many such films are forgettable, some are patently awful, some are entertaining on some level, while a few manage to hit the right mixture and make for very good cinema. They also used to provide a great breeding ground for new talent to try their luck with limited resources and less risk than the big leagues, and the cinema could do with more such opportunities for new film-makers to try out. \"The FastAnd The Furious\" doesn\\'t quite hit the heights achieved by John Carpenter\\'s early work or the golden age of Noir but I\\'m certainly not sorry I watched it.Paul Walker comes across as a blond Keanu but is engaging as the undercover cop investigating high-speed robberies whose culprits seem to hang around the illegal street racing scene in LA. Vin Diesel (who was superb as the convict in Pitch Black) is charismatic in the more interesting \"guy on the edge\" role, and everyone else does their job effectively. The familiar story follows of an undercover mission  becoming complicated by loyalty, emotions, and things not being as simple as they look, with some good high speed driving sequences along the way. The performances, direction, characterisation and dialogue are not exactly Oscar-winning but to use the racing analogies used by all the papers who reviewed this movie, it is flashy, has a good engine and overcomes a slight lack of finesse through pace and energy. Better still, you can tell from the opening titles and delirious first race that this is not intended as anything more than fun entertainment, so you forgive the cliches and occasional false move from the script. It certainly stands comparison with any of the $100m mega productions against which it was competing.The whole thing plays out nicely to a big action finale, and it chooses one of the handful of recognised ways for a story like this to end. Overall, it was a fun movie and worth watching once for anyone who likes a bit of unpretentious high speed fun. Rent the video, relax and enjoy.\"', '\"I stopped caring about half way about what\\'s going on. Too much story made for a convoluted watch.\\nMartin and Smith were ok, not much else went on\\nðŸŽ¬\"', '\"Ok, this is not an intelligent triller. It is different from the first. John Woo and Sir Tom Cruise opt of the more \\'violent\\' approach. With amazing affect. MIF Man, Hunt is out again, with longer hair and a more muscles, to stop a virus. Dougray Scott is the baddie. And thats simply it! I admit this is a silly daft film. But who cares. Calling it daft does not mean its bad. This is no way a bad film. The visuals are great. John Woo is a god when it comes to action, as with Hard Target and Face/Off. The scenes of Cruise on \\'holiday\\' scaling a mountain is breathless. The end shoot-outs, bike chase and final show down are also fantastic. And when Tom Cruise kicks the gun up...... amazing. Its a daft plot, but look at it as a panto. Like with Gone In 60 Seconds. Its a film to unwind to. You don\\'t need a brain. You will not be a disappointed.If you liked the Matrix this will also appeal to you. Black leather, lots of guns and some great martial arts done in \\'slo-mo\\' style. All to a thumping soundtrack by Hams Zimmer and Limp Bizkit.This is a great film, and there is a lot worse. And Thandie Newton is rather fine too!\"', '\"I truly do love 2001\\'s somewhat remake to Ocean\\'s eleven. Ocean\\'s eleven is directed by Steven Sodeburgh(Out of Sight, Che)and I can see how. Sodeburgh is a good director, and he directed the whole trilogy. The film has a great cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Bernie Mac, and others. Just to name a few. The film has a great heist also. These people are way too smart for me. I never could\\'ve thought of a heist plan like the one Danny Ocean\\'s group came up with. The heist is brilliant in this film, and it\\'s pretty surprising. Ocean\\'s eleven is great, fun entertainment.The Plot: When Danny Ocean is released from prison, he hires ten people to rob from Terry Benedict, who owns The Belagio, and The MGM Grand. Danny also finds out that his ex wife Tess is engaged to Bennedict. So the gang isn\\'t sure whether Danny is trying to rob this guy because of his wife or not.\"', '\"When I saw the trailer of The Fast and The Furious, I thought I never ever want to see such a stupid looking film. When I saw more of Vin Diesel I decided to change my mind and see also this film.And it wasn\\'t so bad! Of course all that cars\\'n\\'girls stuff was a bit too much for a feminist soul, but I really loved the cool girls Letty and Mia! They just had the right attitude :)The film isn\\'t only about cars\\'n\\'girls, it is also about friendship and loyalty and that\\'s very rare in the world of today. And that was something I appreciated a lot. I liked the chemistry between the cop-Brian and the villain-Dominic and the way Brian managed the situation in the end was beautiful.Despite the bad talk, Vin Diesel made great acting and I also enjoyed Paul Walker\\'s character and his struggle in his conflict mind between the cop-consciousness and friendship.\"', '\"Soderbergh brings together a brilliant set of actors in this remake of the Sinatra classic.

Danny Ocean (Clooney) is a criminal (and a liar, ha ha) who\\'s just been released from jail. He dreams up a convoluted scheme to take down 3 of Vegas\\' largest casinos, all, incidentally, owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). Danny needs money to fund the operation and a crew. Danny goes to Reuben Tishkoff, who\\'d love to see Terry go down. Next, Danny brings together the eclectic crew of criminals, from actors to bomb makers to a tiny Chinese gymnast.

This movie absolutely blew me away. I mean, I expected an action movie but this went way over my expectations. I joked with my friend before the movie started, how Michael Bay is the king of explosions. Let me tell you - he outdid himself this time. He\\'s practically made it into an art form in this one. Hello! The action sequences are so up tempo, high energy, that all I could do, was just sit there and release some \"Whoa\\'s!\" and a lot of laughs with frequent intervals. In my opinion, this is the best action movie so far in 2003. Heck - best one this century even. And that is with Reloaded and T3 fresh in mind - which I loved. But the Hummer scene for instance had my jaw on the floor! Now that\\'s how to shoot a car chase. Outstanding!On a pondering note, I gave this movie a 9, but I saw that almost as many people gave the movie a 1 rating as people gave it a 9. I realize that taste is different, but 1?? In my opinion you have to rate a movie for what it\\'s for. You won\\'t see intricate dialog or life changing philosophical questions argued too much in this movie. It\\'s an action movie! And it\\'s supposed to be rated with that in mind. Just my two cents, s\\'all. Now go see it!\"', '\"Just didn\\'t click this time around. The combination of Jay\\'s naivety and bravado in the first made for lots of laughs; here, the former is gone and a cocky vet just isn\\'t as funny as a brash rookie. Kay\\'s also gone for half the flick, so that doesn\\'t help. It\\'s not bad, per se, and there are some good moments (see the locker colony, and the cheeky reveal at the end) but annoying villains, an empty \"romance\" (I can\\'t even call it that seriously) and a lame plot linger more than anything else.\"', '\"This movie was a lot of fun. It gets a 6 purely because I was entertained while watching it. It knows exactly what it is and who it caters to and doesnt try to be anything else but an over the top racing flick. If you go into it expecting a deep introspection into Paul Walker\\'s character, you\\'ll be thoroughly disappointed. It\\'s a by the numbers movie and I\\'m sure it was impressive for the time, but the only way one could find value in The Fast and the Furious is if they grab some friends and turn off their brain for a bit.\"', '\"Since this is been remade with Naomi Scott and Kirsten Stewart I decided to relive the 2000 Action film starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu along with Bill Murray and tells the tale of 3 young women who work for a man named Charlie (you never see his face btw) and they have to figure out who wants their boss dead.The action sequences are good,the acting is grand and the real villian was sorta obvious as this villian also played a villian in a film that came out in 1997(clue it\\'s a Disney movie).Keep an eye out for LL Cool J as Drew Barrymore\\'s disguise and Melissa McCartney.\"', '\"With a class director and four of Hollywood\\'s top stars, you would expect a guaranteed success. But not with this unnecessary repeat of one of Sinatra\\'s minor films. Soderbergh seems to have no empathy with any of his stars. George Clooney\\'s normal sparkle is missing: Matt Damon is even more wooden than usual: Brad Pitt is anonymous, and even Julia Roberts is so subdued that you cannot see why Andy Garcia and Clooney are in the least interested in her.The plot - yet another heist - builds up slowly through the standard Hollywood stages - recruitment of team, preparation using a simulation, the robbery and the smart escape. But it\\'s all been done before (not least by Tom Cruise in \\'Mission Impossible\\'). There\\'s no excitement, and the quickfire(?) dialogue is muttered so indistinctly by the cast that half the time you need subtitles to follow what\\'s going on. Worst of all, the hope of an unexpected twist at the end - all that kept me awake through the final stages of this boring film - is ruined by a final sequence crudely and obviously set up only with a sequel in mind. A waste of time.\"', '\"Pros: Action sequences.Cons: Score, overexposure of cruise, tries to be like James Bond.After the brilliant Mission Impossible, the series has taken a turn for the worse under the helm of John Woo. Cruise fans should love this movie because he is basically in almost every scene and always smiling. In the first film he acted, this one he basically just flashes his smile, what\\'s up with that. The script is nonexistent and how many times do we really need a face-change sequence. John Woo has recently had a bad streak since he came to hollywood and this is his worst film. Cruise doesn\\'t even assemble a team when he captures Thandy Newton, he basically does it himself. Ving Rhames who was good in the first film feels like his role is basically a cameo. This film has lost its roots from the television show and instead wants to be like James Bond. Thandie Newton is basically eye-candy, she isn\\'t even needed for her skills as a thief but instead for her skills at seducing. Dougray Scott is a bad villian. What the h**l happened to the brilliant score of Danny Elfman, instead the score is rocked-up. The only saving grace of this movie is the motorcycle sequences. The fight scenes between Scott and Cruise is lethargic at best and seems like a fight out of WWF smackdown. Who cares about Chymera and Belereform. Hopefully Fincher can save the series.Premise: Hunt must stop a deadly virus.Mission: Impossible 2 was not nominated for an Academy award but it won MTV awards and was nominated for Razzies.Grade: 4/10 (Horrible).\"', '\"Mission: Impossible 2 is definitely not liked as much as Mission: Impossible was. The simple plot and strange characters bring the movie down a little bit in ratings. Thandie Newton has no idea what she\\'s doing while acting as Nyah in this film. I would compare her acting to the acting of a dog! The rock climbing scene was exhilararting but extremely fake. As much as the articles will say: the junk about Tom Cruise really doing the stunt while being 600 feet above the ground with no safety net. His wife wouldn\\'t have let him. Nicole would have hyperventilated like the director\\'s in all her films do when they see her act. This movie definitely does not have the clever plotlines like that of the first one but still, Mission: Impossible 2 is an action-packed ride that will surely give action a new name.\"', '\"Rating: * * (out of four)This Bond film is one of the most disappointing, I think.  It is actually a lot like a Raymond Benson Bond novel, only not as good.The action scenes in any Bond flick are crucial.  Here, some are good, some aren\\'t.  The opening is great, the swordfight is fun, and the car chase is excellent.  On the other hand, the chase with the satalite laser is stupid, the climax is dumb, and the others only adaquate.  Overall, the action is just okay.  So, except for the car chase, the action isn\\'t a good reason to see this.The Bond films really invented some special effects; Thunderball (1965) won an Oscar for them, and Moonraker (1979) had some cool post-Star Wars ones. But in Die Another Day, they are unconvincing CG ones.  The climax might had been better if the special effects weren\\'t so cartoonish.  Throughout the entire film, the special effects are really, really cartoonish.Storywise, it\\'s just more of the same.  A bad guy tries to do some major damage with a space satalite.  Yay.Pierce Brosnan is another disappointment.  He has gone downhill since he started.  In Goldeneye, he was excellent and gave one of the best performances as Bond since Sean Connery (though he still wasn\\'t quite as good).  But after that, he went downhill.  He was fine in TND and TWINE, but here he really doesn\\'t do that well.  It\\'s mostly the script\\'s problem, but still.And there isn\\'t enough humor.  One of the best things about the previous Bonds, even the Timothy Dalton ones, but Bond\\'s non-stop dry humor. Here, Bond says a couple of puns early on, but that\\'s it.  There is other humor, but Bond is dull.Why should you see this film?  Well, Halle Berry is outstanding as Jinx. She really carried the film.  The car chase is one of the best in the series, and the swordfight is unexpected and interesting.  And Madonna\\'s theme song is great.  But otherwise, the twentieth Bond film (not including Never Say Never Again) is a real disappoinment.* *\"', '\"Delightful caper picture, proving that Soderbergh is the best director working today. From an improbable script and a lead (Clooney) who is usually wooden, Soderbergh crafts a fast-moving piece of sheer entertainment. There are no GREAT MEANINGS in the film, only the barest of plots, and yet it\\'s just a great ride. Sit back and enjoy.\"', '\"Ah, James Bond. The Burger King of the movies (he\\'s much better than McDonalds) - a reliable franchise where you know that when you\\'re in the mood for it, you can get something tasty. But this is the 20th film in the series (as all the nostalgic references remind us) so is the recipe stale? Nope. Bond films will indeed have to wait to \\'Die Another Day\\'.I\\'ve always like Pierce Brosnan\\'s Bond, who has nearly the charm, dangerousness and wit of Sean Connery\\'s definitive version, but also has some vulnerability, which makes him a more human and sympathetic figure. It\\'s an update to suit our age, as are the stronger roles women have had in the recent films. Kiwi director Lee Tamahori continues these trends and also updates the special effects, which are spectacular. This is one of the best Bond films I\\'ve seen - from the agents surfing in to North Korea, to the car-chase on ice, to the delightful scenes with Q and Moneypenny, \\'Die Another Day\\' is great fun. Yes, there are too many corny puns, even by Bond standards, the action sequences get a bit much by the end of the film and Madonna\\'s title song is awful. But Bond is still, as they so obviously wanted you to say with the ice and diamonds theme, very cool.7 1/2/10Tane\"', '\"After leaving this movie, I had one word in my head.....WOW. I couldn\\'t tear my eyes off the screen during the whole film. The movie was packed with action scenes, which were very well done, and lots of suspense, which kept me interested. I suppose the main plot itself could have been better, but still this was a great film. If you\\'ve seen the first film (1996), don\\'t let it give you a bad impression, because this one is 10 times better. A definite must see!\"', '\"This may be the worst film  of the new century, so far anyhow. A mindless plot studded with inane dialogue and absurd and excessive special effects, all of it shot with pointlessly artsey dartsey camera techniques. The worst of Hollywood with bad writing, bad acting and bad production. With all the bullets that fly for two hours, it\\'s too bad one of them didn\\'t put this turkey out of its misery. But then, lousy shots all, they didn\\'t hit much in the movie either.\"', '\"What can you say about this? The mere idea is a ridiculous one: Three sexy female detectives take on second rate villains who apparently couldn\\'t find the time to challenge James Bond. I guess even Bond has his standards when it comes to villains.The story is that three airheads (played by Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu) are assigned to solve the kidnapping of a famous computer industrialist. This leads to a film that makes no sense and moves along at a slug\\'s pace.The whole cast is just wasted with the three stars making total fools of themselves with the only thing keeping it entirely afloat is the unique chemistry between Tim Curry and Bill Murray and a rather interesting bad guy played by Crispen Glover.The action is lame and rather cartoonish which leads to an identity crisis: who was this film intended for? Kids will be bored and even adults will tire of the endless and tasteless t&a jokes.Bottom-line? This is a crash and burn mess. It is moronic, sexist and full of some hammy acting by some otherwise talented people. What a lousy movie!\"', '\"I\\'ve read a lot of negative comments about this film, and all I can say is: lighten up!This is a motion picture. Fiction. From beginning to end, it is just a story meant to entertain, which is how I rate movies. I go to escape my dull and boring life, and be entertained.Ok...so there were some scenes that require the viewer to work a little harder to achieve a willful suspension of disbelief, but what the heck...we do that almost every time we sit down in a theatre.Yes, I agree that Tom Cruise could have been replaced by Pierce Brosnan, and they could have called it a Bond film without changing another aspect of the film. And I would have been just as entertained. Hey...I like Bond!And yes, this film deviates quite a bit from the \\'60\\'s (!) television show, and I\\'m sorry for that. It could have been a much richer film. But in comparison, I was much more disappointed in The Phantom Menace than I was in this one. Overall, MI:2 keeps it\\'s pace, and aside from a plot device (you\\'ll know what I mean when you see the movie) that gets waaay overused, this gets a 7/10 from me. Go enjoy! Oh...one more thing...It\\'s worth seeing on the big screen just for the sequence in which Ethan Hunt is introduced.\"', '\"First off I am a fan of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer so I may be a bit biased. That being said this sequel was worth the 8 year wait. It surpassed the original in every aspect. The action was much better and not over the top like others are claiming. This one was much funnier than the first. Martin really stole the show with his comedy in this one. The story was what you would or should expect from a summer action blockbuster. I get tired of reading reviews on here about people knocking movies like this cause the story is not an Oscar worthy screenplay. I mean did you really expect that going in to it? Did you see the first one? I respect others opinions dont get me wrong it is just that you have to go into a movie in the right frame of mind in order to enjoy it. This is not a movie that causes the audience to think alot which is fine. If you spend the entire two and a half hours over analyzing the movie for all the unrealistic things then of course you are not going to enjoy it. It is a movie for goodness sake. They never say that the film is based on a true story or actual events. If you are unable to suspend reality for a few hours and just enjoy a movie then dont waste your time or money and then come on here and cry about it. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen this year. It has something for everyone. I would like to see a Bad Boys 3 if they treat it like they did this one. They dont need to rush and throw one together so it can be out in a year or two but Will and Martin have an undeniable chemistry together and this movie series are both of these actors best work. If you are looking for a great time at the movies and not Shakespeare then this is the movie for you.You are your own best critic.9/10\"', '\"I honestly did love this movie more than most people probably did.  This is not a movie to see if you want a well developed plot.  This is a high octane movie with explosions and and great action sequences.  The only thing I did not like about this movie was that it had too much violence. They also could have done a lot more with the plot of this movie but I guess the director thought people come to this kind of movie for action and not stories so it is hard for me to fault him.  Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are great in this movie and I really do hope to see a third installment of this movie.\"', '\"I really disliked this one. The girls may look quite sexy, and the special effects are quite cool, but besides that I couldn\\'t find anything good. The special effects are far too over-used, and most of them look like being stolen from other flicks, matrix for example. Another thing is the humor. I like a funny movies, and action plus comedy CAN make a good mix, but the humor in this one seems far too dumb and not very funny at all to me. I don\\'t think I will watch this movie again, or recommend it to others, there are just too many movies out there that are lightyears ahead of this one.\"', '\"The film is slick.  For the most part one is not bored. It hums along at an interesting pace.  But one is left wondering: why all these big names (Director: Soderbergh Actors: Clooney, Pitt, Damon, etc) doing something as ordinary as this?  Still, I suppose they need a break from more serious things (just as watching them in this caper is).  A 6/10 from me i.e. above average.\"', '\"Tom Cruise can do a bit more on the acting part, but thanks to John Woo, this film was incredible.  The action scenes were just breathtaking.  Wow! It\\'s unbelievable how many times I said that during the movie. Nyah was HOT too.  Man, guys, you gotta go see this movie for the girl, if you can\\'t find enough reasons to go see it already.\"', '\"I was hesitant to see this film because I\\'ve hated every John Woo movie I\\'ve seen (Face/Off, Broken Arrow, etc).  His over-the-top-macho, stunts-where-none-are-needed, laughably-silly movie making style does not entertain me at all - I find it really annoying.I should have trusted my instincts.The first M:I was not a great movie, but I enjoyed De Palma\\'s plot twists and supporting performances by Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, Henry Czerny, and Jon Voight.In M:I2, I thought Cruise was good - he always is - but he had no help. There are no good supporting performances in M:I2.* Dougray Scott\\'s villain looked about as menacing as Michael J. Fox.* Thandie Newton\\'s blank, seductive stare got old in about 5 minutes.* Anthony Hopkins was not in enough scenes to make an impact in the film.* Ving Rhames\\' great character from the first M:I was totally watered down and rendered irrelevant.This movie is all about visual imagery and stunts - I\\'d even say they had Cruise grow his hair a bit longer just so it would \"look cool\" when he performed his aerial, somersaulting drop kicks in the fight scenes.  Such shallow film making doesn\\'t cut it in my book.If you don\\'t care about plot or acting, you\\'ll probably love this movie - I was surrounded by people in the theater who seemed to enjoy it.But, if you\\'re among the few \"cursed\" with intelligence like me, and more discerning and picky about what entertains you, don\\'t waste your time. Instead, go see a real movie - like the re-release of Hitchcock\\'s \"Rear Window\".  In theaters now.Rating:  2 out of 10\"', '\"By the far the best film i have ever seen. Its jam packed with action from start to finish, and its hands down the funniest film i\\'ve ever seen too. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are absolutely tremendous in this film. They make the film so good. The storyline is good, the special effects are breath taking. If you haven\\'t already seen this film then you have to go out and see it right now, its absolutely amazing. It is the perfect film, full of action, comedy and great acting. You\\'ll be rolling on the floor laughing at this and you\\'ll be amazed by the action sequences. This is film is simply a masterpiece. Amazing stuff!!!!!\"', '\"The long-awaited and in the media cheered version of the 1960s movie (starring Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra) OCEAN\\'S ELEVEN was to be a success and nothing but a success.

I love James bond films and therefore I may be slightly bias, however with 20 films to choose from I can clearly say this is the worst Pierce Brosnan bond film. The film largely in my mind is Lee Tamahori the directors fault the subsequent director of \"xxx2\" he just turned bond into something he\\'s not an animated character. bond is the worlds greatest spy and \"no one does it better\" Lee Tammahori also made the fatal mistake with regards to \"die another day\" add cgi and special effects to James Bond. Tne latest film casino royal will be better so go watch. i just feel sorry for pierce Brosnan his \"bilion dollar bond\" was reduced to special effects rubbish as a result of die another day. worth a rent and a great film but not a patch on the other James bond films visit www.free bond news.com for the latest bond news.\"', '\"Thanks to Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton for one of the most action packed movies I\\'ve seen in a long time. Excellent from beginning to end. Will Ms. Newton be appearing in Mission Impossible 3...I sure hope so! While your at it...since Mr. Greg Morris (one of the original cast members)has pasted away, why not feature the remaining members? Now that would be a gas. Thanks once again.\"', '\"A slick, adrenaline-fuelled action flick featuring a hot cast, a cool soundtrack, and countless custom cars, The Fast and the Furious is designed primarily to appeal to the young petrol-head crowdâ€”those who would spend a fortune on a sound system for their ride and then blast crap music out of the windows while sat in a McDonald\\'s car park (at least here in the UK). Anyone heavily into car culture will probably wet themselves in excitement over the modified machines on display.But even if the idea of highly-polished Japanese street cars with more expensive accessories than a Kardashian doesn\\'t get your pistons pumping, there\\'s always the human eye-candy: for the ladies, there\\'s blonde-haired, blue-eyed Paul Walker and bald bit of rough Vin Diesel, while the guys get numerous tasty young women to ogle, including Jordana Brewster as Vin Diesel\\'s younger sister and Michelle Rodriguez as feisty girl-racer Letty. We also get lots of impressive stunts to keep the pulse pounding, with a great chase scene featuring one character dangling from a truck cab while being shot at by the driver, and a white-knuckle jump across railway tracks in front of an oncoming train that results in a spectacular crash.\"', '\"Shaft is modern day exploitation movie, when had their time in 70. The story follows John Shaft tough and honest cop. He is an investigator in homicide case in which young black boy was beaten to death. He arrests the murderer but he is a son of wealthy real estate developer and this case gets shaft into a lot of problems. Now this film is not a detective story, it is an action film. Culprit is known from the beginning only question is how Shaft will get him. Story of this film is nothing special and sometimes it is a little bit flimsy. Acting is solid especially form Jackson, Bale and great Jeffrey Wright playing Hispanic mobster. The film is shot quite well and action scenes are fun to watch. Overall a little better than mediocre film which will reach its goal â€“ entertain you. One interesting thinks this film is a bit of sequel to the film Shaft and subsequent series. Which were about a cop Shaft. Actor who played original Shaft is in this film in the role of hero\\'s uncle.\"', '\"Overall, it was a good Bond flick with most of the traditional ingredients. Brosnan has grown into the role, especially when you compare his somewhat stiff, though good, reprise in Goldeneye.Madonna\\'s theme song is pretty ugly and I won\\'t be buying the CD thank you very much.  For me the most major annoyance is the use of Matrix-like stop action crap.  It\\'s disrupting to the action sequences and doesn\\'t add anything to the film in my opinion.The worst scene is the Bond parachute surfing bit.  Half the theater laughed out loud, myself included.  While the Bond films always pushed the envelope of plausibility (especially the later Roger Moore films), this particular scene was so bad to be laughable.  Luckily it and the finale were the only really poor scenes in the film.I\\'m happy that Brosnan will come back for a fifth appearance as Bond.  He seems to strike the correct balance between Sean Connery\\'s serious Bond and Roger Moore\\'s more clownish version.I\\'d give the film an 8 but given the above glitches, it\\'s probably a 6 or a 7.  Of course, if the next film continues in the direction this one has gone (techno title music, goofy camera effects, way unbelieveable stunts) it might be the last one I\\'ll see.\"', '\"I have to admit, I did not come into this movie with the highest expectations, as I usually don\\'t go to action films, althou I did really enjoy John Wu\\'s Face/Off.  However, I did not expect the dialog to be so bad that that half the audience (including me) would be laughing at the corniness of it all.  The slow-mo editing was cool in the Matrix, where they were supposed to have some no-so-human abilities, but here it just lifted the un-realistic and cheesy factor.  A lingering glance in the middle of a spinout?? And what is with the liberal use of doves????  Unless you look at it as a comedy, have the ability to do a complete suspension of disbelief, or ONLY care about slo-mo action shots, don\\'t bother!!\"', '\"I didn\\'t want to watch this movie.  My son talked me into it. Spoilers Alert The best that I can make out is that this very very young looking undercover cop was trying to solve some sort of crime spree.  There was alot of hot cars, with god only knows how much money invested in them, driving around alot.  Driving fast.  I spent half the movie trying to figure out how these deadbeats could afford these cars.  Ok.  So, the good guy and the bad guy become friends.  The good guy doesn\\'t want him to be the bad guy and tries to find someone else to blame for the crimes being investigated.  (I think that had something to do with the bad guys sister being the love interest of the good guy.)  I continued to watch this waiting for some kind of plot to unfold and then suddenly there was the end.  There was this very short climax that involved bad guys getting shot or shot at and lots of very expensive cars being mangled.  The main good guy and the main bad guy have a showdown.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then the good guy lets the bad guy drive off into the sunset.  We have no idea what happens to the bad guy in the hospital, the still living members of the main bad guys gang, or the (very upset betrayed feeling) love interest of the good guy, or even the very very young undercover cop himself.  I don\\'t like loose ends and this movie had a ton of them.  And did I mention it didn\\'t have much of a plot?  Very disappointing to say the least.\"', '\"Well, I just saw MI:2 and I must say that it pails in comparison to the first. It kinda dragged in the beginning. I mean, guys, I know how cool Tom Cruise is and am very much aware of his sexual proweness,but c\\'mon! I wanted it to start off with a bang! Instead, we are given something half baked. The dialouge was very weak and there are some major holes in the plot.Predictable.Predictable.Predictable. The cast was good. They were a handsome and effective bunch. Dougray Scott was very impressive as the movie\\'s villian, but he was weighed down by a bad script. The other thing that kind of made me upset, was that they took a lot from the movie Darkman!Those who are fans of the movie will pick up on this right away. The best thing I can say about this picture are the action sequences! Nobody does it better than John Woo! They were well staged and executed! If you are going to see this movie, may I recommend that you see a matinee showing! You won\\'t feel like you were robbed at least.\"', '\"I saw this movie a few years back and I thought is was good enough. Not actually being able to remember what my interests where back then, I did however by it on video when I got The Mummy 1 and 2. And I think I watched it once after that. But recently I\\'ve picked it up, after seeing the second one again, which I must say is a little corny, especially when the angel are about to fight Demi. (On the Desodo Case: we know.....LAME)The second has less realism, less plotting and less.....Crispin. The first Charlies Angels is a really good movie. I cant stop watching it. For people who are paying attention: no thats not the only reason. I like the fighting, I like the jokes, and come on: every bodies got to like The Chad! Any way, I don\\'t think bagging any ones going to solve the problem, but I must say Bill Murray made a better Bosley. And they should have had more Crispin Glover to, for lack of a better word, make the movie creepier. But all-round Charlies Angels 1 is a good movie and any body with spare time and a love of leather and go-go boots should watch it. \"The Chad is stuck\"\"', '\"First of all i don\\'t understand why everyone is complaining about the violence & strong language in a film like this. The rating alone should give you the idea that this is not for the Barney (you know the purple dinosaur) lovers of the world. If violence & strong language offend you in films, change genre (action,in case you not certain,i mean you need an IQ to understand complicated words) & stop complaining about films that use it as means of entertainment. I mean the good guys kill the bad guys,does this not prove that good conquers evil. The story is pretty basic,cops fight the bad guys & in the end they win.Clap clap!!!we all go home. The comedy mix in this film is brilliant, just as the case with its predecessor. The performances are by no means worthy of Oscars,but they are believable. This movie reminds me of what movies were made for in the first place. To entertain the target audience & keep them coming back for more. If you didnt enjoy this movie,it is obvious you don\\'t fall part of the target audience,so don\\'t come back for more,i am sure there should be a Pauly Shore movie showing somewhere near you and that should keep you entertained till the crack of dawn. Step aside Matrix: Reloaded with its overdone visual fx and your over-the-top & stupid story & even worse performances,this films chase scene is by far better & more believable & as a film it is leagues ahead of whatever game the Matrix wanted to play. This is the definitive movie of the Summer,Fun,Fun,Fun,Fun,Fun.Oh yes i forgot to mention that this movie is Fun.Its so nice to watch a movie where you don\\'t need a Masters Degree in Film Study to understand what is going on & still be entertained. Go watch this now!!!\"', '\"I thought this movie was good.  I also think that Rosamund Pike (Miranda Frost) did a better job then Halle Berry as a Bond girl.  It seems most Bond Girls of the later movies aren\\'t the best actresses, at least when they\\'re in Bond movies as Halle Berry is a good actress in Monster Ball.\"', '\"I was really eager to see MIB2, even avoided any trailers. So yesterday four of us went to see it. Well, this must be the most disappointing sequel ever. There was *nothing* in it except for light and mostly stupid fun. The dog definitively had the best lines. Jones and Smith looked and acted as if it was only the rehearsal. There was no spirit, no real story, no real wittiness building up throughout the whole movie. Even many Special Effects where simply bad ! The ending is incredibly dull, repeating the one of the first movie (which was cool) just on a smaller scale. It looked...thrown in. The movie felt like a cup of coke after 2 days in the sun. What where they thinking ? I mean, are the people involved in this aware of the piece of crap they produced ? One guy in the cinema went to cash desk and shouted \"i want my money back\" :) The cashier had a agonized look on her face :)When reading the 95% similar comments here i\\'m somewhat disturbed about the high rating, who are those people ? Extra terrestrials ? hehe.I gave it three stars, only for the dog.\"', '\"Directed by Steven Soderbergh, this brilliant movie rates 10 out of 10 on the celeb-o-meter. With the gorgeous George Clooney (Danny Ocean)joined by the equally handsome Brad Pitt (Rusty Ryan) it appears this film can do no wrong. The central plot of the movie revolves around Danny\\'s impossible plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos, conveniently owned by Terry Benedict, his ex-wife\\'s (Julia Roberts) new man. The script is full of witty and slick dialogue, providing plenty of comedy moments, notably between Pitt and Clooney. However, the enjoyment of the film is let down by Don Cheadle\\'s dodgy cockney accent as Basher. You cannot take your eyes off the screen for a moment- not only because of the males but the plot is very complex and you may leave the cinema wondering what just happened in the last two hours. The soundtrack is one of the best film soundtracks I have heard and full credit should be given to composer David Holmes. All in all, a thoroughly entertaining movie, highly recommended.\"', '\"Three casinos. One hundred and fifty million dollars (the stakes, not the film\\'s budgetÂ…but you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise) and just under a dozen of modern cinema\\'s most capable and recognised stars combining to create I daresay the greatest heist movie of all time. As Jake LaMotta once said: \\'That\\'s entertainment.\\'Hit-and-miss director Steven Soderbergh assembles George Clooney and Brad Pitt, who in turn assemble Damon, Gould, Mac, Qin, Reiner, Jemison, Cheadle, Affleck (the good one) and Caan (the young one); a crack team of thieves and con-artists poised to rob Terry Benedict (Garcia) of his wealth and, if all goes well, his girlfriend (Roberts).There is a lot to like about this film from an artistic perspective. The cinematography is always slick and co-ordinated beautifully with the required speedy pace. This is particularly impressive upon a second viewing. Because of how few individual shots were actually used in this film compared to most other contemporary efforts, one has to admire the skill in direction; being able to convey so much activity in so few shots without leaving the film feeling sluggish is a real credit to the production team.While dynamic filmmaking from behind the lens is part of the reason for how well Ocean\\'s Eleven engages its audience, it is the actors that set the tone perfectly. Heavy-hitters like Damon and Garcia are persistenly in control of every scene, and are complimented by some above-average performances from the rest of the cast. But it is the fantastic interplay between Clooney and Pitt that makes the movie. Accommodated by an offbeat script that plays towards these two actors more than any others in the film, they inject a believable \\'buddy-comedy\\' undertone, which doesn\\'t feel at all out of place, probably because the movie refuses to take itself seriously. Rather than trying to convince us that to steal money from a casino in this way is actually possible, Soderbergh positively lets the mechanics fall by the wayside and instead puts his primary focus on pure entertainment.As a rule of thumb, the ending of a heist film does not have to be its strength, as knowledgeable audiences are content to have simply gone along for the ride, and whatever ending the film throws together to justify the series of events will usually suffice. For Ocean\\'s Eleven, this is where a refreshing point of difference lies. A twist ending of sorts, the conclusion is altogether satisfying, unique, and has clearly been well thought-out, so as to avoid a minefield of potential plot holes.This film is as much about the essence of Vegas and excess as it is about a crime syndicate. A sexy soundtrack (the kind of music you expect to hear in the Hard Rock Hotel foyer), fun references to other genre-moulding crime films (including The Godfather and Sinatra\\'s original Ocean\\'s Eleven), expansive shots of The Strip\\'s skyline and cameos galore make the film utterly enjoyable in the plainest sense of the word. *There\\'s nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*\"', '\"Wow!!! What a film!!!  I loved this film as you can probably guess, and there\\'s not much in this movie that\\'s not to love.  The three angels are stunning, the fight scenes are incredible, special effects are awesome, and there\\'s never a dull moment.  I loved every minute of this movie, and I would easily go and see it again.  For anyone going to see this movie, don\\'t take it too seriously and just enjoy this incredible cinematic experience.\"', '\"By far, the best action star of today is Jackie Chan.  The man is simply amazing.  There seems to be nothing he can\\'t do.  His physical skills are unmatched, and his good comic timing and expressions add to his many talents.  Chan is the only truly believable action star because everything that shows up on the screen, he actually does!  No stunt doubles, and only marginal room for error.  He is perhaps the only star in Hollywood today who, alone, is worth the price of admission.\"', '\"Me and my girlfriend really enjoyed this movie a great deal. There was always something going on that kept you clued to the screen. Be sure to go to the restroom before starting this film because you won\\'t want to leave it at any point. There are two really great chase scenes in this movie that has some new stunts I\\'ve never seen in any other movies before. Camera angles and camera usage in this movie are great also. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are a great team and click very well together. We both liked this sequel better than the first and we thought it was pretty good. It is about 2 hours and 20 minutes but well worth it.\"', '\"I\\'ve never liked the original \"Bad Boys\" from 1995 despite its reputation as one of the \"better\" cop-buddy movies out there. In my opinion it\\'s all style over substance and director Michael Bay\\'s annoying use of the sun-drenched, hard-hitting, always-moving camera distracts from the reality of the friendship between Smith and Lawrence\\'s characters. The over-the-top action violence and stupid sex gags make the story seem unrealistic and the characters fake.The sequel isn\\'t much better. It\\'s eight years after the first film (can\\'t believe it took so long for them to cash in on the original) and essentially exactly the same. Smith is still a fashionable playboy who\\'s got it all together. Lawrence is still a neurotic wimp. Their boss (Joe Pantoliano) is still at their throats. The bad guys are still stereotypes, the women are still all beautiful and wearing as little as possible.Even the plot is very similar. They\\'re on the trail of a drug smuggler yet AGAIN. This time the guy hides his drugs in dead bodies and their mission is to take him down and provide enough evidence to incriminate him - so they use a romantic interest to be a mole in the drug lord\\'s operation.Bay\\'s direction is just as bad as before - but now thanks to a much bigger budget, a larger cast and crew and the advent of advanced digital technology, the explosions are bigger, the car chases are longer and more boring, the camera moves even more and never stops zooming and cutting away to other scenes, and so on and so forth.The movie isn\\'t really that funny either. It\\'s just brutally violent for the sake of being so - it tries to add risquÃ© humor and some \"misunderstood events\" to make the film funnier (such as Lawrence and Smith\\'s conversation being displayed on all the TVs in the electronic store), but we\\'ve been there, done that already. It\\'s not worth the time or money that was invested into it on both ends. Hopefully there won\\'t be a \"Bad Boys III.\"\"', '\"I saw this movie yesterday evening with 2 friends. We laughed a lot, mainly because of the gags, the incredible situations in which the characters are taken into, and because of the imagination of the writers.But don\\'t expect to find any coherence in the story, don\\'t expect a director\\'s masterwork, and don\\'t expect unforgettable acting...Entertaining is the best word to describe MIIB, and is the mood you should have if you go to watch this movie !\"', '\"Who would have ever thought that pairing up Tom Cruise with John Woo would have ended up in a let down?  Mr. Cruise has proven time and again (see RAIN MAN, MAGNOLIA, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY) that if given the right material to work with, he is one of the best actors working today.  Mr. Woo has proven time and again that he is a master of the action film (see HARD BOILED and THE KILLERS).  So what happened here?  My guess is that the script by Robert Towne is simply not good, and so even if one brings in John Woo there is only so much he can do.  To be sure, there are some very impressive sequences in this film, but you just don\\'t care.  You don\\'t care about Thandie Newton\\'s character, and you certainly don\\'t care about Ethan Hunt.\"', '\"This movie made me think of a beautiful crystal vase because there were so many comparisons.Let me explain. Both are good to look at. Both are well made. Both took a lot of money to make. But when you look closer you realize just how empty they are.\"', '\"Back when the original MiB was out I didnt see it in theaters, I just bought it when released on VHS, and it proved it self a fairly worthy movie. Now that I\\'ve seen the second I can say it\\'s a great companion to MiB but the overall feel to the movie was that it was forced down your throat. Don\\'t get me wrong it was a good movie, but it just went by far too quick to enjoy unlike the first movie.But this is just one comment...\"', '\"This year I have seen a number of great movies. I\\'ve also seen some real howlers. Charlie\\'s Angels has both feet firmly in the first category, and is easily one of the best movies of it\\'s genre, ever.Yes, it\\'s cheesy. Yes, it\\'s slickly produced. But, unlike so many recent films to which that description could be easily applied (Hollow Man, The Cell), Angels is so obviously aware of it\\'s own blatant ridiculousness. For this, it is to be applauded. Sitting through MI:2, another 70\\'s action-based TV show turned into a slick, effects-driven third-millennial movie, you get the horrible feeling that the directors really believed they could turn a ridiculous, campy TV show into some deep and meaningful social critique. No such high-brow pretentiousness in this film - from the opening scene, which slots in a barely-audible conciously self-mocking one-liner, all the way through every clever reference and spoofed scene, through every pointless chase and exaggerated fight-scene, through every nodding innuendo, predictable plot twist and traditional baddie, McG and his cast have made a film which acknowledges all the tongue-in-cheek sass and cheesiness present in the original.70s TV cop shows, of which Angels was perhaps the perfect example, revelled in their lack of plot but enormous amount of explosions, random car chases and beautiful characters. The clichÃ©s in this film are not lazily slotted in through lack of invention, but deliberately sprinkled throughout to give the whole piece a knowing quality. Even the cinematography is deliberately plagiristic of the 70s TV show.In fact, Angels is nearly as referential as anything Kevin Smith has put his name to. Just check out Drew Barrymore\\'s ET shirt for proof of that. I get the impression that alot of people were expecting a M:I2 style remake, and thus missed the point of this wonderful film.If you want a great Kung-fu movie, go rent \"Enter the Dragon\". If you want a deep and meaningful plot, \"Fight Club\" has just been released on DVD, and \"Dancer in the Dark\" is still in cinemas. If you want a day-glo cross between Mystery Men, Austin Powers and any James Bond movie you care to mention, all wrapped up in a stunning soundtrack (NOT replicated on the CD, sadly) and very modern effects, go see Charlie\\'s Angels.Seriously, if you have any memories at all of Farrah Fawcett and her high-kicking pals, you\\'ll adore this film. I did.\"', '\"You know, I thought that this movie was going to be awesome due to all the hype that it got before it was released.  But when I saw it, I was very disappointed.  The whole movie did not really have to much of a plot, which already ruined it, and the the movie just revolved around cars,cars,cars. And I guess that\\'s ok if your into that sort of thing. Id just assume to watch nascar, which I hate. I remember commenting to one of my friends who also so it that it would have been so cool if at the end Vin Diesel would have gotten nailed by the train, and he said, \"No it wouldn\\'t! That would have ruined his CAR!\".2 out of 10\"', '\"Went into this film with high expectations but left very disappointedBrosnan was agian v good as bond, but I thought it pandered to the US audience too much with Halle Berry who was very wooden - but had better gadgets than bondhad the potential to be the best ever but misfired\"', '\"I liked it enough to see it a few times, and I\\'ll be buying the DVD.Brosnan shows us another side of Bond (He has a beard at onepoint, but not willingly). The villain, Gustav Graves, is a fun evilgenius. Some great stunts and action make this a movie to see. Ihated Halle Berry as Jinx, because she was a huge clichÃ©, and Iloathed Madonna\\'s theme song. Other than that and some veryhokey science fiction elements, it was a good movie. RosamundPike is the anti-Jinx as a terrific Bond girl. See this! 7/10.\"', '\"I went into \"The Sum of All Fears\" expecting to be disappointed by Ben Affleck. I\\'m not really a fan of much of his dramatic work (\"Changing Lanes\" is an exception). I have not seen the other Jack Ryan movies, but I still didn\\'t really think Affleck would make a credible CIA agent. So I was pleasantly surprised by his performance. It certainly isn\\'t Oscar material, but he is very credible, which was more than I was expecting. The supporting cast is also quite good, especially the always impressive Morgan Freeman as Affleck\\'s mentor and Ciaran Hinds as the Russian president.Speaking of the Russian president, I was impressed by the way the film portrayed him. Usually, foreign leaders in films are very one-dimensional. President Nemerov, however, is very well developed, with clear motivations for his actions. He is not the evil madman Hollywood commonly makes foreigners (especially Russians) out to be. In fact, he is arguably a better person than the film\\'s American president. So I commend the writers for that.However, despite the acting and the good characters I did not really enjoy this film. Why? Because it\\'s supposed to be suspenseful, and it\\'s not. I know that Jack Ryan is trying to avert a major world crisis, but having him run around with a cell phone and type on computers does not generate much suspense. This is what a lot of the film, including the \"climax\" basically comes down to. The film is not deep enough to be a serious drama, so it needs the suspense and the action to deliver. Unfortunately, this does not happen. Although \"The Sum of All Fears\" does have some good qualities, it ultimately fails to deliver the basic needs of the genre, so I can\\'t really recommend it. You could definitely do worse, but you could also do a lot better.Rating: 5/10\"', '\"The 20th Bond lived up to its expectations. Which wasn\\'t very hard, considering the last two were my personal worsts in the series. But it delivers where least expected. The opening scene, ending with Bond being captured and tortured provided such an astonishing and unprecedented surprise I actually learned to love the Madonna song along the way. It showed Bond\\'s mortality and was a fresh and good change, because he always managed to escape in the last moment. This movie was probably a turning point for Bond and I personally think that the whole Bond franchise should end with this one. It was simply too good to be surpassed(the car chase!), but I hope I\\'m wrong.Good stuff; -Bond -attractive Bond babes -the villain (amazing job by Toby Stephens) -the car chase(one of the best Bond action scenes ever) -the script -the humor and the one liners -the nice score -the fencing scene -the un-cheesy villains lair -those Matrix-like shots that (to my surprise) worked really well and gave the movie a cool feel -the wretchid Judi Dench as M who I liked for the first time -Zao\\'s facial jewelry -Bond\\'s more human side -great special effectsThe not so good (and sometimes ridiculous) side: -Halle Berry\\'s acting in the helicopter scene -Bond being in captivity for over a year and not loosing any weight -satellite scenes that have been done too many times(and besides, who was filming the satellite itself in space?, because the people in the movie are watching it on a TV screen) -the whole invisible car thing; it could have easily been cut out because it has no true purpose, it just makes the movie loose credibility -the scene where Bond surfs on those waves and then makes a huge jump; c\\'mon -Halle Berry\\'s escape when she jumps from the cliff; it\\'s not only unbelievable, it even looks badStill, a very good Bond movie that made the whole terrible better-than-Bond \"xXx\" would-be-franchise a thing of the past.

It is obvious who the bad guy is, when somebody wears one of those masks and that all the good guys survive. And why isn\\'t it called Tom Cruise: The movie. The only thing that saves it is the unwanted comedy of the movie, cause at the half of the movie it starts to become unrealistic and very funny.

All the actors really seemed to be what their characters were, specially Vin Diesel\\'s. He playing the bad boy who puts friendship above everything is really respectable and it makes the spectator likes him and his friends. Also Walker\\'s character could be considered as a hero and someone to be looked up to, since he cared for people as they were, putting people and their considerations above his job. It was an amazing scene when he saved Vince, because Vince showed no respect and consideration for him; Walker\\'s char could easily leave and let him die, but he saved him without nothing in return: worse than that, allowing Toretto find out he was a cop, leading him to a trouble.Toretto\\'s sister was really sexy and we feel happy when she gets together with O\\'Conner. The cars were awesome and I think that everyone who watches this movie is jealous and wants to drive those speedy cars.

Anything that combines cool cars with hot actors deserves two thumbs up!!\"', '\"I went to see this movie yesterday having quite high expectations - which were not disappointed. Of course Tom Cruise\\'s character is somehow \"larger than life\" just like Rambo and there are scenes that just couldn\\'t work (for example, when he kicks the gun lying in the sand and it flies directly into his hand) But after all this was an highly entertaining and thrilling flick with loads of brilliantly choreographed action sequences - typical for John Woo. So if you liked Face/Off you\\'ll love this one. By the way, this second installment has nothing to do with the original - so don\\'t care about seeing first one before watching M: I-2 in case you missed it. Go see it, it\\'s worth the effort.\"', '\"While many moviegoers will simply pass over Mission: Impossible 2 simply because it is another classic of the summer blockbuster genre, they will be missing out. Critics won\\'t love this film, but they won\\'t be able to claim that they absolutely hated either. Movie fans, and especially Tom Cruise fans, on the other hand, will find themselves seriously involved in it.Most of the discussion of this film has been a contrast to the original, Brian De Palma directed Mission: Impossible. In doing so, the point is probably missed. The difference between the films is more than just stylistic directorial difference, it is an entire genre switch. While the first MI might have passed for an action movie occasionally, it was primarily trying to be Sneakers (1992) starring Tom Cruise--a techno-thriller.When it came to Mission: Impossible 2 on the other hand, director John Woo was made aware that no one really wants to see Tom Cruise hacking at a computer. If anyone has to, it will be a character whom we experience only as a computer hacker--enter the other holdover from the original film-- Ving Rhames.Generally, there are moments when Mission Impossible 2 falls on its face. Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton seem to fall in love instantaneously, and so deeply that both would sacrifice their lives over a one-night stand. That simply reeks of convenience on the part of screenwriter Bob Towne, though the simplicity probably pays off in the end. The fact is that people who will enjoy Mission Impossible 2 aren\\'t particularly interested in seeing a romance, and that\\'s why this one is such a whirlwind effort.There are certainly other flaws, such as a repetitive use of the \"mask peeling\" that we saw overdone in the first film. It is used at every opportunity in this film, to the point that you almost expect everyone to be someone else, but, after all, John Woo made an entire film out of the idea (Face-Off), so should we really be surprised?The film is carried by a couple dynamic performances, a pounding score, and some Matrix-like action sequences that make everything worthwhile. Though the story is formulaic to the nth degree, in the end, it doesn\\'t matter. Mission: Impossible was never about character depth and biting wit, it was about action and suspense. John Woo has brought these to MI2.Cruise, as usual, is effective, though probably too likeable to be real. Admittedly, he has taken a step down from some deeper performances in Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia, but, frankly, it only makes sense. If it weren\\'t for films like Top Gun, Days of Thunder, and the like, Scorsese, Kubrick, and others probably never would have heard of Tom Cruise.On its own merits, Mission Impossible 2 would get 4.5 stars out of 5 for the action genre. However, if we are basing it on quality of film, it would have to drop to a 3.5. Not everyone will like it, but if you think you would be interested, odds are, you\\'ll be impressed.\"', '\"I cannot believe that I paid money to see this drivel.  The actors seemed to be sleep walking through their parts, and nothing about it was funny. Nothing.  The ONLY laugh our theater got was when the chair my husband was sitting in broke and he fell on the floor.  All the \"cute\" characters were utterly annoying (Frank the dog first and foremost) and the plot was muddy and confusing.  I have never been so disappointed after leaving a theater. The really annoying thing is that the first one was very entertaining. I know that sequels normally lack a little of the first, but come on!  It was like this movie was written by a second grade class.  Not good. Not good at all.  Please do not see this movie in the theater.  Think about passing it up on the rental shelf as well.  Rent the original instead and save yourself from wasting precious time on the sequel.\"', '\"You won\\'t find Harrison Ford here, but you will find one of Tom Clancy\\'s best novels magically brought to life. Ben Affleck does a great job as Jack Ryan, the character whom Ford had mastered. Don\\'t try to fit it into any timeline with the other movies. It takes place in 2002 with Ryan as a CIA analyst. It doesn\\'t fit but who cares. The non-stop action and excitement is more than enough to make you forget all that. The story takes us all around the world, but it starts in Syria where diggers find an old Israeli nuke and sell it unknowingly to a Neo-Nazi who uses it to trigger nuclear warfare between the United States and Russia, who are in the midst of nuclear tensions already. It\\'s up to Jack Ryan to stop the power hungry leaders from sparking World War III and possibly destroying the world itself. Morgan Freeman and the fine as hell Bridget Moynahan also have great performances and Director Phil Alden Robinson does a excellent job. I\\'m also glad they changed the bad guys from Muslim extremists to Neo-Nazis as to avoid any stereotypes and hatred towards the Muslim people. Great movie. 7/10\"', '\"That\\'s right, if you like explosions every 5 seconds, gimmicky \"plot twists\", horrible dialogue, unintelligible accents, and absolutely no surprises, then you will love this movie.  And to you, it will be a perfect ten.  But, if by chance, you like intelligent movies with skilled acting (Jude), stuntwork that pertains to the story (Gladiator), in depth character studies (Magnolia), gripping plot twists (Fight Club), or anything else that classifies as art in the film world, you\\'ll probably give this movie about a four like I did.  It reeks with cliches, and unlike the first Mission Impossible, it has a scattered plot that never actually redeems itself.  De Palma used confusion and a variety of locals scenarios to pull in the viewer to a thrilling climax on a speeding train.  Woo merely gets Tom Cruise to do some incredible stunt work and calls it a movie.  Yes, the special fx are great,  yes, the motorcycle scenes were jaw dropping, and yes, who cares that nobody could screech to a halt on the front wheel of their yamaha and still pick four passengers out of a moving car with only four bullets in real life.  But, I\\'ve said it before and I\\'ll say it again.  No amount of spfx, stuntwork, or popular music groups on the soundtrack can make up for a poorly executed plot. And on a personal note, I usually enjoy Hans Zimmer\\'s scores.  He\\'s very versatile.  From As Good as it Gets, to Prince of Egypt, to The Thin Red Line, he is great at crafting the music to the visuals.  But fresh off the heals of composing the score for Gladiator, so brilliantly referencing \"Mars\", as well as utilizing Lisa Gerrard for the ethereal feel of the supernatural, Zimmer seems to copy himself with a similar sound that cheesifies the closing of MI2 instead of empowering it.It seems Cruise (Mission: Impossible 2) does better with De Palma(Mission: Impossible) and Cage (Snake Eyes) does better with Woo (Face Off).4 of 10\"', '\"MI2 is a typical hollywood summer movie.  It has alot of action, a lame script, unnecessary (attempts at) romance, a hard to follow plotline, unbelievably stupid bad guys, and unrealistic physics.I am a big john woo fan - however MI2 has too few action sequences and a marathon of bad interaction between Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton.  After they meet for 5 minutes, they fall in love and during the entire movie, Tom tries to protect her.  Oh please.  Someone shoot me.Speaking of shooting, there\\'s some terrific two fisted shooting sequences and the last half hour has a great motorcycle chase scene.

Barrymore strokes her tongue on someone\\'s steering wheel. Liu swings a mean stick as she addresses a classroom full of males. Charlie is heard but not seen as he instructs the Angels on a mission. Title suggests that these women are not timid. The plot is numerous martial arts scenes that bare nothing to the original show. McG films it like a music video, but one wonders whether he actually remembers anything from the original show because this is a total farce. Barrymore fights off opposition while tied to a chair. Diaz engages in combat while talking on a cell phone. Bill Murray is cast as Bosley their mentor and while there are hints of comic flair, it is obvious that the role is pure cardboard. Sam Rockwell plays the villain whose role is about as enticing as a kick to the family jewels. Its feminist view seems to encourage retaliation against male society. In return, the male society should retaliate against this stupid film by burning every copy in existence. Score: 2 / 10\"', '\"Contains spoilersThe James Bond franchise, in the year 2003, is celebrating it\\'s 41st anniversary. No other series in motion picture history has lasted this long, and it is likely we will be seeing the adventures of 007 for years to come. The series has survived through and beyond the Cold War and a few creative slumps. And unfortunately, Bond\\'s 40th anniversary film, DIE ANOTHER DAY, is one of those slumps.I hadn\\'t seen this film for several months when I watched it last night. During that gap, I had been rather leniant and positive about this film, maintaining it to be an average Bond movie. After all, it was this film, which I saw with my family in November, that initially got me interested in Bond and convinced me to watch all of the other films. As the films came and went, I still maintained a positive stand on DIE ANOTHER DAY. However, re-watching last night and viewing it after seeing all the other Bond films showed to me what a horrible piece of garbage it was and I now find it embarassing that this film got me into Bond.The plot of the film is tired and uninspired, borrowing heavily from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (which was also one of the poorest enteries in the series) and the original novel of MOONRAKER. Despite getting inspiration from one of Fleming\\'s novels, that element is ruined by the DIAMONDS plot. Neal Purvis and Robert Wade had an intense, Fleming-esque story for THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, but in this film, they abandon that for all out action, Moore Era gags, and so much other junk that serves no point to an almost invisible story that I think that some Bond purists will find this film painful to watch.Let us start with the characters, shall we? First of all, James Bond. His capture for 14 months and being tortured was a sheer bit of brilliance that Pierce Brosnan himself suggested. The pre-credits sequence to Bond\\'s stay in Hong Kong make up the one small part of this film worth watching. Once Bond goes to Jamacia, the movie and Bond\\'s character fall apart. The torture sequence showed Bond\\'s vunerability in an excellent way, but the rest of the movie fails to follow up on that as Bond becomes how he was in the worst time of the Moore Era. Bond relies soely on his gadgets and his surf on the top of the ice wave...I\\'ll come back to that. The point is, the Bond character has not been insulted this much since A VIEW TO A KILL. Now onto Jinx. Like Dr. Christmas Jones before her, Jinx is poorly written and serves no point to the story (why was the American NSA after Zao? No reason was given at all). I\\'m sure most of you have heared of all those interviews where Halle Barry says that Jinx is the Bond equal. She\\'s not. She needs to be saved too many times and panics far too easily, especially for a secret agent. Both villains, Colonel Moon/Gustav Graves and Zao are terribly written, portrayed as sterotypical, one-dimensional villains. Colonel Moon kills his own father, and takes pleasure in it. I still say that North Korea\\'s protests against the film due to the villain were unfounded (Moon\\'s father is somewhat of a protagonist), but these villains are horrible. M, Moneypenny (who now looks too old), and Robinson are spared the terrors this film holds, but Michael Kitchen as Bill Tanner is absent. With the death of Desmond Llewelyn (a horrible blow to the series), John Cleese is promoted from \"R\" to Q, and is the new Quartermaster of MI6. He excels in the role, keeping the essence of Q but still maintaing a difference from Desmond in that he intentionally tries to promote laughter by being extremely sarcastic instead of being serious. However, despite Cleese\\'s performance, like Bernard Lee, nobody does it better than Desmond. The one antagonist I haven\\'t mentioned is one of Bond\\'s ladies, Miranda Frost. She serves a point to the plot and is interesting at the beginning, but she too is lowered to a one-dimensional flop.For the first time ever in a Bond film, I have to complain about the stunts, directing, and editing. First the stunts. This film HAS no stunts. A stunt is when a real human being does death-defying feats of nature with all possible measures of safety added in. This film felt the need to insult human abbilites and instead have all \"stunts\" in this film be CGI and bluescreen. The CGI isn\\'t terrible; on the ice wave, I couldn\\'t tell that it was CGI until Bond slides up the one large iceberg; but at other times, the CGI is poorly done. This kind of stuff does not belong in a Bond film at all. Bond films have a reputation for doing absolutely everything for real; why ruin a good reputation? All \"stunts\" in this film are feats absolutely impossible for humans or machines to do and real stunts would have worked just as well, and possibly save this film somewhat. Next, the editing and directing together. The combination of the two make many scenes look more like bluescreen then the real bluescreen shots. The swordfighting sequence in the film represents Bob Anderson at his best, but the effect is dulled by the bad editing and speeded directing. Finally, all the music video, MATRIX-style editing does not belong in a Bond film and I hope that the American editor of this film is fired. Thanks to the Lord that Lee Tamahori won\\'t be directing Bond 21.This film\\'s redemtion that saves it from being worse than A VIEW TO A KILL is that it looks spectacular, the first couple minutes are good, and this film got me interested in Bond in the first place.In summary, DIE ANOTHER DAY is the Moore film of the Brosnan Era, and a bad one at that. Let us all hope that Bond 21 will have a Fleming-type Bond, an intense story, real stunts, normal editing, and good characters. This film gets a 2 out of 10.\"', '\"There is nothing outstanding about this movie. Tom Cruise is a humorless and mildly charming Joe Cool lead and the plot and special effects are just plain average. Recommended only for Tom Cruise fans or those who can enjoy an average action flick. Matrix was 10 times better.\"', '\"I went to see this thinking, \"How dare they do this to Shaft!\"  I came out enthusiastic and excited as one should after watching an action movie.  This really was a good film, if not a little exploitative of the past.  I suppose they needed to use the title Shaft to get it noticed.Obviously it is nothing like the original, except for a few little touches (the shot of a guy being thrown out of a window and the New York traffic scenes jump immediately to mind).  The story is good enough to stand as its own.The acting is pretty good all round, though Jackson is typically predictable (he is a big star, and that is what they do...)  Particularly good is Christian Bale, as the cold racist killer.  You just can\\'t help but hate him.  I hope Bale hasn\\'t been type-cast, but he does a damn fine baddie (contrast him with Doug-Ray Scott in Mission Impossible 2!).  But the real star is Jeffrey Wright, the excellent Latino dealer/gangsta.  Go and see it just to hear his drawl.This is a fine action movie, far superior to some of this years more expensive and highly hyped ones!  Don\\'t write it off.  It is a different film to the 70\\'s film, but still a good one!\"', '\"!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!!!I saw MIB 2 a couple of hours ago and it wasn`t untill I typed this review that I suddenly realised I can hardly remember a thing about it ! Now let`s see I remember special effects ..... well CGI which is so common nowadays I`m not sure if it`s classed as a special effect anymore. Oh and the usually impressive Tommy Lee Jones is in it , but he doesn`t actually appear until the mid way point of the film and this leads to a subplot with Agent K teaching Agent J what M.I.B operations involve . Oh yes those cute worm guys are in it just like in the first film , oh and so`s that guy who can grow a new head .Ah I`m starting to remember what`s wrong with this sequel - it`s very very similar to the original . In fact it covers very little new ground which is okay if you loved the first MEN IN BLACK film  but I didn`t ,  I found it typical Hollywood Summer blockbuster FX laden fare . And I found the sequel worse in this respect\"', '\"Word reaches me that a re-make of \"The Italian Job\" is in the offing. Firstly it would be awful, and secondly do not bother because you\\'ve got all the ingredients here.Yes Soderbergh and Clooney have done and will do better. But there\\'s a lot to enjoy here. It doesn\\'t take itself too seriously, and the stars seem able to live with each other\\'s company.\"', '\"It seemed that the film relied on gags from the first film instead of going for new, more original jokes (the noisy cricket, \"last suit\" line, among others).  Even the new jokes seemed that they were meant to be the jokes of the moment, just way too many pop culture references.  In 5 years, will anyone get these jokes?  Probably, but they won\\'t be nearly as funny as they are now.  Overall, MiB2 seems just like a sequel for the sake of making more money.  The scantily clad villian, pop culture jokes, and fairly unoriginal plot all add up to one thing:  godd for the short term but no long term lasting power.\"', '\"The dumbest film of the year (so far...) Or, is this Tom\\'s promotional film that got lost by his agent and ended up in the wrong can? Whatever it is, to the viewer it\\'s just a really stupid film. Sure, it looks fine on the big screen, but if you want to see it, leave your brain at the door.\"', '\"After having seen this movie more than eight times (not by choice), I\\'ve come to realize that the original unfavorable reviews I read were correct: this film is not much better than mediocre. That\\'s not to say that the film is terribleÂ—it\\'s notÂ—or that you shouldn\\'t watch itÂ—you shouldÂ—but rather that it has many flaws, some of them glaring.Ask most people why they saw the movie, and they\\'ll say something like \"It has George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it,\" or \"It has Julia Roberts in it,\" or \"Stephen Soderbergh directed it.\" Ocean\\'s Eleven is a \"People Magazine\" reader\\'s dream come true. So many celebrities in one movie: what bliss! The point is that Ocean\\'s Eleven is not meant to be strong on character, or plot; it\\'s meant to be strong on Star Power. In fact, it\\'s surprising that there is a plot, such as it is. It follows the new Blockbuster code: Hot Bad Guys who are actually Good Guys want to steal money from crooked, mean Big Businessman; they make elaborate plans, use fancy equipment, and ultimately...but we all know the ending. Soderbergh may court the strange, the offbeat, the underbelly of society, but he also knows that when making an action movie one should not deviate too much from the tried-and-true. He gives us what we want, and more.George Clooney and Brad Pitt as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, respectively, are the most likable of the bunch. They have a rapport that either is natural, or was rehearsed so effectively and so well that it became natural. They\\'re like Laurel and Hardy, only with stubble and expensive suits. They eat each other\\'s lines, insult each other, show off in front of each otherÂ—in some ways they\\'re a more compelling couple than Clooney and Roberts.Incidentally, Julia Roberts, apparently confusing Tess Ocean with Erin Brockovich, gives an intensity to her role of The Chick that is entirely inappropriate. This is an action movie, not a chance to win another Oscar. She speaks words like she\\'s chopping onions: short, quick, and full of force. Of course, her dramatic skill is unquestionable, but in this case a lighter touch would have been more fitting. I can understand her desire (if she had it) of wanting to give more weight to her role as Clooney\\'s ex-wife and Andy Garcia\\'s new girlfriend; it must be frustrating to be a piece of meat that men fight over. But she should have been more perceptive to the genre of the movie and its requirements. In action movies, chicks should look hot and be tough; they shouldn\\'t be too serious.The fact is, we hardly ever think of Roberts (or any of the other Big Names) as anything but who they are off the set. Although Garcia calls Roberts \"Tess\" several times, somehow the name always rings false. The other cast members, being less famous, have the advantage of being able to play their characters more convincingly.This movie was a remake of another all-star movie made in 1960. (I\\'ve been unable to see more than snippets, and where I live I\\'m not able to rent it.) Most reviews refer to this previously made film, but the fact is that Soderbergh\\'s Ocean\\'s Eleven is its own entity. We should judge it not based on its predecessor, but on its own meritsÂ—unfortunately too few.When I first saw this movie, it was in Spain, dubbed in Spanish, and I thought it was well made, well acted, and generally better than most action movies. (Of course, I was on a date at the time, so I wasn\\'t scrutinizing every detail.) Upon subsequent viewing, however, this movie\\'s imperfections only become more glaring. It\\'s too bad. Although you won\\'t think you\\'ve wasted two hours if you watch it, this movie is not one that you\\'ll return to over and over againÂ—that kind of film where each time you see it you discover more of the director\\'s ingenuity, the actors\\' skill, the screenwriter\\'s craft. This movie is good for a quick laugh and a thrill, but, like birthday cake, it\\'s not ultimately what satisfies your hunger.\"', '\"This James Bond film was ok. It may not be the best but it does have very good action and effects. The music and and title song were good. The film is some times confusing. It seemed really different with Michael Madsen in it. Its a descent film but its not the absolute best ever. If you need about two hours to go by then watch this movie!\"', '\"Watching a Jerry Bruckheimer produced film is the cinematic equivalent of consuming empty calories. It will fill you up, but it ends up taking up space that could be occupied by things that are better for you.\"Bad Boys II\" is no exception to this rule.  Director Michael Bay is a filmmaker fully grounded in Bruckheimer\\'s rule of box office hit: bigger, louder and faster are better. Bay makes the movie snap along at a quick beat and there are plenty of action-packed sequences, all filmed with a post-John Woo flair for slow motion, kinetic action, random explosions and macho posturing during the middle of chaos. Oh, and there\\'s a story hidden in here somewhere as well.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith return as detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrery, respectively, two Miami narcotics officers who are magnets for acts of violence and leave war zones in their wake. As the film begins, they are cracking down on a drug cartel trafficking ecstasy in Southern Florida. Years of tension between the two police officers is starting to take its toll on Burnett, who is secretly plotting to transfer out of the squad because of all the stress he must endure being partnered with Lowrery.This anxiety is further compounded by the fact that Lowrery has the hots for Burnett\\'s sister Sydney (Gabrielle Union), a DEA agent who, as fate would have it, is working a different angle on the same case. Apparently a major Cuban drug dealer named Johnny Tapia (Jordi MollÃ\\xa0) is trying to muscle his competition in Miami through various degrees of violence, and is working with Ms. Burnett, whose cover is a crooked banker laundering his money.Really, after that bit of exposition, the rest of the film writes itself. What follows are some of the most incredible action scenes ever filmed, including a twenty-minute sequence that starts as a heist gone wrong, turns into a car chase, changes into a violent shootout, and then turns back into a car chase involving an 18-wheeler dumping the cars it\\'s transporting along the MacArthur Causeway.The action scenes are, in essence, the only reason to watch the film. The rest of the movie is a downright mess. The characters are poorly written and unmemorable, the dialogue unbelievable under certain situations, and the narrative full of needless `comic\\' excursions and cornball scenery chewing. And all I can say is thank goodness for the Internet Movie Database, otherwise I wouldn\\'t have remembered the names of half the characters in the film.The problem with \"Bad Boys II\" is that like most summer releases for the last decade, it completely throws common sense out the window. The main characters leave chaos and mayhem behind them and never once are given a reprimand for their actions. The movie apparently wants to have all the fun of large scale pandemonium without all the consequences (deaths of innocent by-standers, lawsuits, suspensions, etc.). And villains are not human beings; they\\'re just pop up arcade targets that exist only to be bullet fodder.34 years ago when Sam Peckinpah gave us \"The Wild Bunch,\" the first modern day action film, large scale violence was both exhilarating and scary.  It showed us the horrors of aimless gunfire and the cost of recklessness; bloody and mutilated human beings, loss of respect for human life and families destroyed.  It\\'s sad to see that in 2003, following a similar scene that seemingly would leave numerous innocent people orphaned or widowed, Will Smith\\'s character chooses to chew out his partner for accidentally putting a few bullet holes in his Ferrari.Just be thankful he didn\\'t bad-talk your mama, too.5 out of 10 stars: the action scenes were good but everything else reeked.\"', '\"This movie doesn\\'t get the rep it is one of the greatest films ever produced. This is easily one of if not my favorite movie of all time, and Michael Bay did a spectacular job on it. The action in the movie is unlike any movie, the only movie I\\'ve seen with better action was another Michael bay movie and that was transformers. Bad boys 2 is great all around, great action, great acting, great music, and amazing cars. The movie is very entertaining, it goes back and forth between action and comedy all the way through. Don\\'t judge this movie by the rating it received on this site, it is incredible, this movie is what movie making should be.\"', '\"The original BB was a hit and it deserved it when it distinguished itself from every other action film.  It had action and it had sex appeal and plenty of spent bullets but the plot between Smith and Lawrence was actually interesting andfun to watch.  Now, at two and some hours long, and their hate-hate relationship drilling you the entire time, you aren\\'t so much worried about whether they live or die, but whether they will do either anytime soon.\"', '\"I warn you that if you havent seen this movie, then dont read my comment, it will ruin the whole movie for you.This is one of the best movies I have ever watched.  The whole time my eyes were glued to the screen..  This movie has suspense, romance, and some reality.  Ryan(Affleck) was wonderful, he portrayed courage and spirit. When I left the theater, there were people saying they didnt like the movie, I can only wonder, what planet they are from.\"', '\"Ok, for a film that is celebrating 40 years of Bond, possibly the best known Britain in the world, you would expect something special. Well, all the way through this film, I kept getting the feeling that this film was patched together with a few pieces of Bonds from he past (especially Golden eye, car chases, traitors, large objects falling on people from above). The film has a good opening sequence, with the explosions, action and of course witty remarks that we have come to expect, also with an original entrance - surfing (and it looks good). However what happens next is not what you\\'d expect. I\\'m not going to tell you exactly what, but it is a shock, and possibly ruins the film at an early stage. Oh course no Bond film would be complete with out the stunning Bond girls, and Halle Berry does not let us down, ok her entrance is a little to much like that of Ursula Andress in Dr. No. Her part in the film isnt as big as I had thought, but the parts she is in are pleasent as easy to watch. However, the badies are Bad. The stupidly named \\'Mr Kil\\' a henchman of the real baddy, Gustav Graves. His part is quite big for the Bad guy, although over shadowed by his 2nd in command Zao. AHH yes the car scene, this is the high light of the film as having two cars with more gadgets that a swiss army knife fighting it out over a frozen lake. It really is something good, although the \\'Invisible car\\' is a good idea, it really should be in a Bond 10-15 years ago. While on ideas that really belong in past movies, the wind surfing-thing is poor, even by todays special effects standards, even the whole idea of it is bad. On a plus side, the idea of a Virtual reality scene is good, and as you will see, leads to a very funny scene. John Cleese is also good, in fact better than in the previous film. Brosnan and Judy Dench give good performances, and SHOULD be welcomed back into any planned future Bond film. Also the ice palace is a good idea, and has a large part to play in the action.Altogether this isnt the best bond film, yet it isnt the worst. See it in the cinema, or wait to rent. On a plus side its entertaining, has nice action sequences, cool gadgets, Nice looking women and it also mocks our friends over the pond, when they only want to blow up the whole of N. Korea, when a single British spy can do it almost single handed. 6-7/10\"', '\"The fact is that I was expecting this film to be released in order to watch it.Sometimes when you expect too much from a movie you are disappointed when it doesn\\'t reflect your expectations. I am 99% sure that this is not what happened with this one. I am positive that even if I was not anxious to watch it I would still hate it. I enjoy watching action films but this experience was beyond any imagination. The fact is that they made it so unreal that instead of being anxious and excited this movie made you laugh.And not just me, trust me! Anyway I gave it a 3. Not only cause it was hard to concentrate on it but also because it was predictable, boring and too hard to believe as much as I would like to. It is possible to kick a gun in the sand and make it land in your hand! Too pity I lost almost two hours watching it.\"', '\"It\\'s hard to imagine that anyone out there could actually have been clamoring for a sequel to 1995\\'s \"Bad Boys.\" Yet, eight years later, along came \"Bad Boys II\" to remind us that even the least deserving film can get itself a follow-up, provided it has the right amount of high-powered corporate backing and big enough names in the cast to get the job done. As with most sequels, this one comes replete with a Roman numeral neatly tucked behind its title to give it that extra special touch of class. However, in this case, perhaps the II really stands for \"twice as bad.\" This new film, which is indeed even longer, dopier and duller than the original, once again stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as two Miami P.D. undercover cops who spend most of their time kvetching at one another in between car chases and shootouts (and often during as well). As this is a Michael Bay film, rest assured that the gun battles and vehicular mayhem have been designed on so grand and epic a scale that we wonder that the entire city of Miami along with a good part of Cuba haven\\'t been reduced to rubble by the time Smith and Lawrence are done doing their thing.The nominal plot involves the partners tracking down a Cuban drug kingpin (yawn) who is smuggling Xtasy to the states hidden inside gutted corpses. This allows for some truly vile humor at the expense of some innocent dead bodies (\"Six Feet Under\" this definitely is not). To complicate matters, Lawrence\\'s beautiful kid sister is also working undercover for the NEA and the fretting Lawrence does everything he can to make her job all that much more difficult.The screenplay by Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl encompasses every cop buddy clichÃ© known to mankind. First, we have the hyper distraught captain who somehow fails to see the genius behind the boys\\' unconventional crime fighting methods. Then, in place of characterization, the boys engage in a running repartee of stale jokes and tiresome put downs that continues on even though all around them bullets are flying and bodies are piling up. Finally, there is the threatened sundering of the team over petty differences and the equally inevitable patching up of differences at the end. And the humor is so lowbrow that the film lacks even the saving grace of laughter to make it all bearable. Basically, this sequel is just another opportunity for Bay to beat his audience over the head with frenetic editing and mind numbing action.\"Bad Boys II\" might have been more aptly named if they had simply dropped the word \"Boys\" out of the title altogether. It would at least have given audiences a more truthful and accurate description of the contents.\"', '\"I was really looking forward to watching this movie and I was not disappointed.  It was awesome!  \"The Fast and the Furious had some of the best car chases ever filmed.  Paul Walker did a great job as the undercover cop, he has a bright future in the movie industry.  Vin Diesel was awesome as Dominic, he just looks cool and he can kick butt.  This movie has everything women, fast cars, guns, and a kick butt soundtrack.  This is a must see for all action fans and if you want a adrenline rush this is the movie to see.  Rob Cohen did a great job with this action masterpiece.  I give \"Fast and the Furious\" ****stars and two thumbs up!\"', '\"I was never interested in seeing \"Oceans Eleven,\" though \"Ocean\\'s 8\"\\'s release slightly made me want to see this film as well as its sequels. One boring day, I decided to watch and I had very low expectations. After watching it, I HAD A BLAST... at the film\\'s 2nd and 3rd acts.Acts 2 & 3 - FUN AND SMART! The planning and execution of the heist was a brilliant ride from act 2\\'s start to act 3\\'s end. These acts were near-perfection! (Some parts were slightly boring)ACT 1 - The film has a lot of supporting characters which, sadly, meant a lot of dragged and sometimes uninteresting introductions to said characters. If act 1 was the entire film, I\\'d give \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" 4 stars. Thankfully, it\\'s not.NOTE: Though the character introductions were too long and, at times, uninteresting, the actors did their best. Their on-screen charisma made these scenes slightly better.I still have one more flaw with this film: Julia Roberts\\' character. Despite her amazing performance, her character was just a plot device for Danny Ocean. Yes, a plot device is important but when a character is a plot device, the film shouldn\\'t make you feel that said character IS a plot device.Overall, I had a blast with \"Ocean\\'s Eleven!\"\"', '\"First of all, before this movie i didnt really care and wasnt really into cars. Now that i have watched the movie, i love cars. I thought this movie deserved 2 thumbs up because it was interesting and theres lots of action pack in it. I liked this movie alot because it gives you a look and feeling how it is like to race and to have people race against you. I especially liked how they made a movie only about street racing. I would rate it 10 out of 10 because it has alot of action pack and it doesnt take awhile before the movie gets into the action, in this movie it starts right away. I think whoever loves old or fancy and fast cars will love this movie and i loved all the cars in this movie especially the black car in the end.(the one vin disel was driving)\"', '\"Well folks, I thought I\\'d see an entertaining film..  What I saw instead was The Fast and the Furious...  This movie should have been Gone in 60 Seconds, maybe it should have been put out of its misery with a Bullitt...  Hmmm, Deathrace 2000 would have been more humane...Anyway, I thought his movie would have brought back some of my own feelings of blacktop mayhem (hmmm, should I copyright that?  Blacktop Mayhem.... Could be next summers Fast and the Furious, eh?)...  Tooling around town in my turbocharged Daytona, sometimes I get the same feeling I used to get when my ground pounding \\'69 SuperBee belched fire and roared thunder from its 383 Magnum...What I got instead was a lame excuse to show a bunch of imported pocket rockets burning up the road...  The street race scene, supposedely a 1/4 mile race (but never actually stated to be such) took much, MUCH longer than the accelerated film speed would indicate.  Heck, it seemed like a full mile...  I\\'ve seen races at Belmont run faster than this!  Oh, wait, and we\\'re supposed to believe that our hero is able to operate TWO computer interfaces for his fuel management system and GPS locator (okay, that\\'s a joke, but hell, so is his movie) while he\\'s blasting down the road at over 140 mph, FOUR abreast!  Not me, baby, I\\'m gonna have MY eyes glued to the road and those OTHER idiots!I almost, ALMOST got interested in this movie when they started to try to develop a plot.  Okay, so Brian\\'s a cop, he\\'s undercover, and Dom and Trang are under suscpicion for truck hijacking...  The Feds are involved, they want the hijacking stopped before the truckers start arming themselves for vigilante justice.  Boys and girls, trucker vigilante justice (hmmmm, another nice phrase for a summer movie) would have been MUCH more entertaining - as witnessed by the scene when one of our hapless hijackers is pinned down by a faceless shotgun wielding trucker...OH, and wait... At the end of the movie...  Well, I won\\'t spoil it (the movie itself does a passable job of doing that), our \"hero\" performs an action that is SO out of character, that is SO anti-reality as to cause one to sit in one\\'s chair with his mouth hanging in disbelief...  Are we to actually believe that a cop, sworn to uphold the law, who\\'s every movement has been scrutinized by not only his superiors and the FBI is going to act in the way he did after the final action sequence?  I think not.Save yourself a lot of grief and a little expense.  Do NOT buy this movie unless you see it on the $5.99 rack.  Wait for it to come out on cable... Trust me...\"', '\"As night falls on the streets of L.A., souped up cars, driven by souped up kids, illegally race at incredible speeds. That alone is more than enough to keep the cops busy, but it appears that a number of robberies on moving trucks could well be the work of the speed racers. Time for someone to go undercover, someone with a flair for speed and daring do heroics.........The title says it all actually, from the very first sequence to the pulsating ripper of a finale, this film really is fast and furious. Dumb in substance and morally dubious in to the bargain, it is however one of the finest exponents of the action/thriller/crime genre of modern times. Owing certain debts to Point Break and Stone Cold, director Rob Cohen has crafted a technically adroit picture which is an assault on the eyes and the ears. Cars tear around, crash bang and wallop, thru the camera, under trucks, in front of speeding trains and on it goes, with no real let up till the end credits roll. There is a plot, it\\'s thin, but it does have a story from which to race around. The cast flex their muscles and pout respectively, with a little bit of eye candy for either sexes to admire from their comfy chairs. Boasting great stunt work mixed in with very capable CGI, The Fast And The Furious deserves much better regard than it currently has on some internet sites. Why? Because it does what it tells you it will do from the title, and as dumb as it is, it\\'s the best kind of dumb to loose yourself with. 8/10\"', '\"Cold blooded violence - extremely cruel killings.  There was not a plot - just chase and kill.  A waste of some very talented actors and a major waste of electricity and film.

I enjoy action films - this is not one.  90 minutes in a slaughter house.\"', '\"Pierce Brosnan gives another excellent performance as James Bond in \"Die Another Day\". It opens up with James going to a Korean army base, disguising himself as someone else who the Koreans trust very much. He is, however, caught and is about to be killed but (of coarse) escapes. This scene begins one of the many action filled scenes that this movie holds. It has a clever plot and great performances from Brosnan and Halle Berry. This is (in my opinion) the best James Bond movie ever! The action is great, the special effects are amazing, and the plot has many twists and turns as it goes along. Only complaint: Some action scenes go on way to long and eventually get boring, but other than that, this is the greatest Bond film ever made!*** out of ****\"', '\"THIS MOVIE SUCKED MAJOR MEGA BIGTIME! It was interesting but it sucked. The movie is completely far fetched and it takes place all over the place- it is confusing and frustrating to tag along. In the beginning, Bond is captured after making us like the fact that he won- THAT NEVER HAPPENS WITH BOND. Then he is disrespected and he has to prove that he still deserves to be with MI6. There were so many awful one liners and some characters, especially Gustav Graves, were terrible actors and had some of the stupidest things to say. The first half hour is interesting, but from then on the story is very far fetched- it is like a child with no writing experience wrote the rest of the film.

I wasn\\'t all too fond of Busta Rhymes, but I can deal.  The movie won\\'t be a summer blockbuster, but it is definitely worth scoping out.

But I would hope that those people, those of which I haven\\'t met face-to-face, would enjoy it for all the wrong reasons. This is a guilty pleasure flick of such a high order that unless the person watching the movie is just in it for all of the stupid, horrid, racist (yes, racist) and mind-boggling moments in this film that add up to innumerable counts, you\\'ll need a quick dose of Stephen Hawking to get your IQ level back up to speed. Believe me, there is a reason why Edgar Wright parodied this in Hot Fuzz - he saw what it was going for, perhaps even enjoyed it in terms of its plasticity as a film, and decided to mock it mercilessly. Even as parody, Hot Fuzz is Lawrence of Arabia when compared to Bad Boys II with regards to comedy, action, acting, storytelling, violence, and even intentional over-the-top hilarity. Oh, this is a bad movie indeed...And yet, hence the ellipses, I must admit that when when Michael Bay turns his own visual floodgates loose, it\\'s... still bad. But in this case it\\'s the kind of fascinating bad that you can\\'t turn away from. There\\'s no need to talk about plot - it\\'s Miami Vice meets a 6th-removed-inbred spawn of Lethal Weapon - so let\\'s jump into the meat of the potato, shall we? It\\'s all about flashy action that is meant to EXPLODE the audience AWAY! Two capital letters, people! When we get a car chase, it isn\\'t just a car chase, it has to include LOTS of machine guns and rapid-fire cuts to the people firing guns and people driving/dodging/crashing their cars, so much so it has to give John Landis circa 1980 an aneurysm. When we see Martin Lawrence and Will Smith banter, it can\\'t just be banter - it has to be just a notch above jive-talking, sometimes just plain mean-speak (if too ridiculous like when the two ambush a 15 year old asking for Lawrence\\'s daughter on a date and Smith just happens to have a 40 of beer).Oh, and when we are shown what Cuba is like, it has to be the kind of Cuba that doesn\\'t mind its shanty towns (the kind one saw in such a sympathetic and poetic light in I Am Cuba) ripped to pieces by a Hummer (yes, one of those BIG-F***-YOU cars) and a, uh, other truck following behind. Oh, and if there\\'s some schmaltz, like say Will Smith\\'s cop looking at a goofy yearbook picture of himself when he was a NERD (and yes, it\\'s shameful to be such a nerd in Bay\\'s house of movie), or when the big twist occurs with Lawrence\\'s cop\\'s sister taken hostage, it can only last said two seconds before going on to the next idiotic joke, or the next retarded shot or cut-away, or, of course, such an action scene that will bleed your senses dry. If you happen to also be watching at home, get ready to scream at your television and have something to throw at the screen. It\\'s one of those, oh yes.But did it ever get so bad that I came close to turning off the TV? Well, almost, like when Lawrence does a \\'this is what happens when you get on E\" scene, which is so painful to endure it made me pine for the leg-shaving scene in Cabin Fever. For all that Smith might try, he and Lawrence don\\'t click in a way that is funny - unless if the kind of humor you enjoy is the rude and (ugly) sarcastic tone that Bay often carries being a 40-something frat boy - and many, many scenes meant to bring out guffaws left me dead cold. Which means, of course, there\\'s a lot of dull time where Bay tells a superficial drug deal plot where one can feel his patience where thin during the running time. I can imagine his script notes in a scene of simple dialog: \"Ok, this is all good, but... where\\'s the explosion! I need something HUGE to knock this f***er to the ground! How about a random fire or a landmine? Can we put an armed nuclear robot in the scene somewhere - ah, here it goes!\" So as you can imagine, Bad Boys II is junk of a high order. Sometimes, like during that big car chase on the bridge I did my best to get into it, I laughed at the wretched talent on display, of Bay\\'s slick knack for composing shots and then disgust at the shambles of the result in the editing room. It\\'s what Bay and, not to forget, Bruckheimer do best, I suppose. Not a fan, you could say, but in this case, curiosity got the better of me... or worst. Grade: D-\"', '\"the setting: first showing monday morning 5/29/00 and the theater was half full at best. that made it the perfect environment, you can stretch out and relax. i went into this theater with out the influence of critics, also.\\nfrom the opening scenes to the credits i saw something that has become quite typical of movies lately. shall i say computer enhanced stunts/action sequences. you know the ones that im talking about, they just dont look natural... which leaves the scene feeling somewhat empty and not believable.and since there where many scenes of this nature in the film it left the whole film feeling somewhat empty. also the background music didnt flow together, so every time it changed you noticed. almost at level of being distracting.the biggest laugh of the movie i got was the motorcycles that magically changing tires from smooth street tires to the dirt bike style, and then to have the camera focusing on them. i personally expected more out of WOO. none the less the film was entertaining, i didnt leave screaming and i can appreciate what cruise did for the film, actually seeing the actors face in the action/stunt sequences where nice. (jaboo if your out there contact me)\"', '\"I am a big Bond fan - although I am not one of those who think Sean Connery is the best Bond and all the rest are worthless. I love Connery\\'s Bond - cruel, powerful, charismatic; I also enjoyed Roger Moore\\'s outings (except for the last two - \"Octopussy\" and \"View to a Kill\") - his Bond was light-hearted but clever and unflappable; I personally think Dalton made the best Bond - his Bond was gritty, strong, and  believable (!). This latest movie with Brosnan confirms my opinion that the Brosnan Bond is vapid, generic, and ineffective.Most of the credit (?) for this must go the screenplay writers and the director who seem to have forgotten a basic tenet of storytelling - make your audience care for your characters and what happens to them. A quarter into the movie and I no longer cared about its outcome - DAD just failed to make a case for continuing to watch the movie although it had all the ingredients. There has been a lot of brouhaha about how \"Die another day\" (DAD) has deepened Bond\\'s character by having him tortured and making a rogue agent out of him. This is laughable - all that torturing (in a beautifully imagined title sequence) seems to have deepened Bond as little as it affected me in the audience (the visuals were seriously undercut by the Madonna song). The rest of the movie did not *show* any changes in the Bond character (what ever happened to \"show - don\\'t tell\"?). For a Bond movie that has successfully developed a different Bond character, take a look at \"License to Kill\" where Bond\\'s vengeance seeking feels real and unforced and the touch at the end with the cigarette lighter only serves to reinforce the tragedy.This lack of storytelling is so egregious in DAD that the movie seems to lurch from one set piece to another without a hint of development. The good Bond movies build their story up from premise to finale through a tantalising series of climaxes and anti-climaxes. These movies were essentially duels between Bond and the arch-villain and pace themselves as such, with the energy escalating with each encounter. DAD does away with such niceties. The duel in DAD is a prime example of this - nothing that comes after has the raw feel of this fight sequence. Coming as it does at that point in DAD, the extent of Bond\\'s investment in the duel with Graves is inexplicable given that this is the first time he is meeting Graves and knows nothing about him. DAD, then, immediately moves to the blowing up of Graves\\' castle in Iceland. Whatever happened to Bond the spy? What happened to discovering who Graves was and what he was upto? Whatever happened to suspense and tension and anticipation? Why a finale without anything leading upto it? Why a betrayal which lacks any power to shock because the script did not take the time to lay the ground for it? Even \"The World Is Not Enough\" for all its flaws did manage to make Electra King\\'s betrayal vital and effective.I think one of the main problems with the Brosnan Bond movies is a diluting of the Bond charisma - to the point that it begins to feel generic. Yes, the gadgets are cool, the explosions are spectacular, the locales as beautiful and the women as alluring as ever. But the movies now lack that something that kept the previous movies together - style. Brosnan\\'s Bond lacks style - his movies are so chockful of explosions now that the details that etch out his style are missing. Bond\\'s mystique comes from the way he talks, the way he stalks, the way he handles the guns and the girls - DAD concentrates all its energies in showing off the set pieces and blowing them up that it sees to have nothing left for Bond himself. Whereas the great Bond movies use the chases, the exploratory wanderings in the villain\\'s lairs as well as the fillers in between to show Bond\\'s style, DAD treats Bond as it would any other generic action hero.Whatever happened to James Bond?

Which would have been quite awful way to begin the new millennium. Or end the last one, depending on how annoying you are about that issue. Do not see this movie even if Tom Cruise rings your doorbell and threatens to wave his long hair in slow motion as he did so often in film if you don\\'t view it. It has absolutely no redeeming qualities about it at all. The tape inside the film\\'s video cassette is to thick to use as dental floss, To long to work as a belt. Also This movie is not only awful, it is a total knock off of Notorious by the incredible director Alfred Hitchcock. The following parts of Notorious were completely stolen and screwed up by Tom: Cary Grant and Ingrid meeting at the race track and her boy friend becoming suspicious of them. Cary seducing  Bergman and then using her in his spy work. Ingrid having to go under cover and marry the bad guy, who is in love with her. Tom, if your going to make a movie that sucks, please don\\'t try and tarnish a perfectly good Hitchcock in the process.\"', '\"Sorry, this just ain\\'t a great movie.  I expected a middle of the road Hollwood movie, but it doesn\\'t quite measure up to that.  Manages to build only a low level of suspense using one of the highest suspense scenarios around.Actor-wise, Ben Affleck is a very lucky man - his pay to talent ratio must be one of the highest in the world.  I just don\\'t get him as a leading man.

He didn\\'t fool around with story, the character or try to dress it up as something it wasn\\'t. He made the plot simple and surrounded Shaft with the right people. He understood who Shaft was & is. He was always about justice, serving right & wrong in his own unique way. He doesn\\'t waste a lot time with talk, he moves forward letting his gun, fists or feet reason with his adversaries. Perhaps not the right way but maybe in John Shafts world it is the righteous way.\\nA major plus, outside of the directing & writing, is the cast. From top to bottom, from the familiar character actors who give perfect readings of their roles to the top are excellent. Samuel Jackson is perfect as Shaft, he has a ball playing him and channels the spirit of who Shaft is. Christian Bale is absolutely amazing as the smart ass sociopath rich boy/man who think\\'s he is a God among men. But for me the best of the group is Jeffrey Wright as Peeples Hernandez! An absolutely brilliant turn as the craziest drug lord on the block with dreams of gaining entry into a world of respectability that will never let him knock on the door much less enter it. His ability to capture the screen with a look, a whisper, a smile or a turn of phrase is just simply brilliant. A early role that shows how he will soon become a dominant presence.\\nA almost perfectly done action movie that knows what it is and doesn\\'t mess around with pleasantries.\"', '\"What can I say about Ocean\\'s Eleven? It\\'s sleek, stylish, and very fun. It was interesting the whole way through. But the one major disappointment was the extra scene at the end.

The extra ending completely ruined the mood of the movie. Anyway, I would recommend this movie.>\"', '\"I\\'m never one to write reviews, but this film is one of my favorites for multiple reasons. The 2 main characters of Brian and Dom are just a match made in heaven with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel playing them respectively. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez fit perfectly as the love interests and are some of the most badass women I\\'ve seen in car films. This film is a timeless classic because of the car chases, the chemistry of the actors, and the greatness of the action displayed with the cars. The directing was really well done for a movie of this scope mixing slow motion in some car sequences with the real time effects of the stunts that the cars are undertaking. The music fits the film well, and it maintains the tone of the film superbly.The original of the fast and furious saga definitely set the bar extremely high for the sequels and luckily some of the sequels have been able to reach and some exceed it.\\nMost of all this movie is special for me because it was influential in my childhood as it was the first PG-13 movie I ever saw as a child (I was 5) lol.\\nJust an awesome movie all around. Check it out if you\\'ve never seen it before.\"', '\"This movie sucks, but it\\'s strange how it fails.When you get down to the Mission: Impossible series, all of them are almost the exact same story told over and over again. And yet they all work despite the fact that they always have the same beats. Each one involves Ethan Hunt getting disavowed by the IMF and having to work with the barebones essentials without the safety net of the government. He always has to break in to a place before someone else does, usually involving great heights. And the climax is always an insane chase sequence. But, they all work because instead of coming to the movies for the plots, you come to it to see how each director gives his stamp to the same plot.Except for this one - for the most part. It very much has the same action beats - especially the break-in and the chase scene - but is done in such a bloated, boring, bombastic way that it kind of feels like the cinematic equivalent of television static. They trade the \"we\\'re on our own, guys. We need to find who\\'s framing us,\" storyline for some sort of riff on \"The Spy Who Loved Me,\" and in trying something new, it accidentally fails the worst.On the series\\' standards, there\\'s really two big failures: one, Ethan is never disavowed, so the tension of a man left to his guns is non-existent. Two, and the far bigger sin is the fact that there\\'s never really the big Tom Cruise stunt set-piece that we\\'re looking forward to. The closest is the opening credits rock climb sequence, but that\\'s not some big setpiece with stakes -- it\\'s just the character\\'s intro. He doesn\\'t really have anything for the story to move forward, and in context, it\\'s just Ethan Hunt on vacation. He does this for fun, so we\\'re not in suspense at anything he\\'s doing. So, if anything, this sequence actually damns the rest of the movie because there\\'s no big stunt for him to top maybe outside of the chase at the end.Thandie Newton really is the MacGuffin, and I don\\'t really want to put most of the blame on her, but too much of it is her fault. She\\'s more annoying and smug that charming, and so we don\\'t really care about this whole \"Spy Who Loved Me\" thing her and Ethan are going through.Dougary Scott as the villain... I actually don\\'t remember anything about him other than how he acts when he\\'s first introduced, and he\\'s one of those bad guys who\\'s more just smug and evil for the sake of being evil. He actually reminds me a lot of how horribly Rupert Everett played Doctor Claw in the \"Inspector Gadget\" movie. He\\'s not as bad, but he definitely belongs in the same vein.The Mission: Impossible series actually creates an interesting timeline of blockbuster action movies at the time each was made, and this one really may just be a victim of timing. John Woo was no longer this beloved Hong Kong-action maestro; he was more of a poor man\\'s Michael Bay who\\'s style was really getting stale at that point. It also represents the era where script doctors were over-used. It\\'s not like they haven\\'t been rampant for the last 25+ years, but this era especially had this problem where it felt like every single page of the script was written by a different writer.The saddest, though, must be Hans Zimmer... my God, HOW could he make a score this boring? He decided to base it heavily in guitars, mainly electric and Spanish acoustic. The electric makes it feel like a try-hard college freshman frat-bro, the kind that blasts the loudest metal he can out of his stereo. It\\'s the lamest, it\\'s like Nirvana trying to be Limp Bizkit. I think he was trying to off-set the \"loud, energetic, bombastic\" electric with the \"cool, serene, laid-back\" Spanish acoustic, but it is just so boring and pretentious. It\\'s not calming us down, it\\'s lulling us to sleep. It might just be my musical tastes repelling that really acoustic sound - I hate it, it just sounds like a guitar being tuned - but at the same time, I should not be thinking that something by the guy who did the music to \"The Lion King\" is not done as well as it was in \"Spy Kids.\" Yes. \"Spy Kids,\" and I think that\\'s because Robert Rodriguez is actually Mexican, and was using the guitar to compose, not as an esthetic. I always thought that maybe this series needs to stick to the same story line to keep interesting, just having the director spice it up, and for the most part that has been the case. However, Rogue Nation is basically what this movie was trying to be without abandoning the staples of the franchise and coming out at a time when not all action movies sucked. So, not only does it make this a failed experiment, but the fact that that movie exists, and succeeds, makes this movie entirely pointless, not even for curiosity\\'s sake. I have the blu-rays of the series, but to be completely honest, I haven\\'t used this one for anything other than a coaster.\"', '\"I\\'ve not seen many heist or crime thriller movies, but this one was good. The plot was decent and I liked the build-up and planning of the heist which felt mostly realistic I felt. There were a few twists here and there, but not much to intrigue the audience which is probably one thing I felt the movie lacked. But overall the movie was still good and I liked how they preformed the heist, which didn\\'t feel unrealistic like some other heist movies.\"', '\"Despite what the title may say this is not a bad movie. Just not as good as the first. Again the tech doesn\\'t hold up but there aren\\'t very many TV shows or Movies that can with the dramaticly changing technology industry. While some of the action was pretty good the plot was sub par at best.\"', '\"The first Mission: Impossible won over the audience by leaving the comfort zone of most spy films. With a great modern classic of action cinema created, Universal Pictures continues the franchise trying to expand it and elevating its grandeur and several levels. With the proposal to always change the director, letting each one leave his \"author\\'s mark\" in the films of the franchise, the chosen one to lead this sequence is John Woo, Chinese director specialized in action films and until then known by the recent \"The Last\" Threat (1996) \"and mainly,\" The Other Face (1997) \"with John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. Therefore, Woo was the obvious choice of producer and star Tom Cruise, who wanted to launch the franchise headlong into insane and increasingly \"impossible\" action.With the departure of Brian De Palma from the direction, the change in style was already evident in the first minutes, in which the spectator finds himself in an explosive action scene in the middle of the plane to, soon after, see Ethan Hunt, on vacation, practicing climbing in a cliff without any safety equipment. These sequences already gave us the introduction of what we would see ahead: exaggerated and stunning action scenes elevated to the tenth power. The far-fetched and technically-savvy style emerges, highlighting suspense, classic espionage and the game of appearances, and something different, more combative and less ingenious comes in. This is not necessarily totally bad, just a different language, another look at the franchise, something that can complement and enhance what had already been presented to the viewer.One of the reasons the original film took four years for this sequence was certainly the elaboration of the action scenes, all very well shot by John Woo and with his signature: slow motion and circular movements. Tom Cruise recorded most of the film without stuntmen, leaving the director and his entire team very concerned. The scene in which Ethan Hunt, the character played by Cruise, is climbing a cliff, believe it or not, was filmed with the actor himself hanging in the Utah mountains, one of the film sets. The rest of the film was made in Australia, which, incidentally, was very well photographed by Jeffrey L. Kimball, who makes the most of the natural beauty of Australia and its capital, not just the kangaroos, koalas and crocodiles, as it usually happens. Another positive point for the pair formed between Woo and Cruise.The script, now written only by Robert Towne, is one of the weaknesses of this film. The speed with which the events take place leaves the plot a little unlikely. Privileging only the main actor, he leaves the other characters in the background and out of focus. Just see what happens to the Nyah thief. After an automobile chase (one of the positive highlights of the film) that almost ends in death, she throws herself into Ethan\\'s arms and, the very next day, is plotting with him how to enter the enemy\\'s hideout, an ex-boyfriend of hers. Everything like that, easy. Perhaps only James Bond to achieve this with a woman in such a short time. In order to prevent this continuation from facing the same criticisms that surrounded the original film, which had a confusing and full of holes\\' plot, the script tries to always remain within reach of the viewer\\'s understanding, leading his characters to explain what is happening every ten minutes. The inevitable result is that Mission: Impossible 2 ends up being a little slow in its second act - which is a shame, since the first fifteen minutes and the final forty-five are, to use a more than appropriate clichÃ©, \\'pure dynamite\\'.\\nJohn Woo\\'s management, on the other hand, firmly believes in the incredible at the expense of the believable. The filmmaker ties the choreographic impossibilities with the plot in a more coherent way, in this aspect, than in the excellent classic of the 90s. The most impossible is not the mission accomplished by the characters, which, in reality, does not even matter much to involve us during the projection, but the humanly improbable achievements, conductors of a sensuality and an identity that have much correspondence with the quality of the director. Right at the beginning of the film, it already provides a complete inversion of his intuition for the franchise. The icon of the moment is Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Woo\\'s job is to mystify him incredibly, in a way that makes him not only a symbol of espionage, something shared with the classic James Bond, but also a mirror of the cinema of \"real\" action, with impressive explosions, high-speed chases and a beating to entertain the most insensitive.The sequence that precedes the credits, as in the 007 series, is intense and goes straight to the point without wasting time with unnecessary explanations: we meet the villain, we realize how cruel he is and we are soon led to meet Ethan Hunt, hero of the original film, while he climbs a mountain without the aid of equipment (and without stuntmen, as Cruise made a point of carrying out the risky maneuvers only with the help of a cable - which was erased during post-production, obviously). John Woo is fully aware of the proposal of his action, even of his drama, more loaded with theatricality. We are not talking about schizophrenic sequences, although the quick cuts lead to a vision of the type, but a very dynamic, but controlled conduction. The spectator\\'s amusement, entertained by great moments, such as the hand-to-hand duel between the hero and the villain, already at the climax of the tape, arises from the surgical work of the edition, which does not make us a lost audience, but immersed in a game in the what time is everything.Most of the construction of the plot is based on the sexual interest between Hunt and Nayah (Thandie Newton) is made in the first visual contact between the two characters, interspersed with a dancer\\'s dress, coming and going in slow motion. If that were not enough, the scene in the bathtub is also very good, giving the involvement that the script itself does not.\\nSome scenes are worth mentioning. The intense car chase in Sevilla between Ethan and Nyan on a road that borders a cliff is played out as a flirtation, a beginning of courtship that will connect the two characters emotionally throughout the narrative. This romantic action adds some layers to the protagonist, who genuinely cares for Nyan - and this more humanized aspect of Ethan would be explored a lot in the following films. We also have the electrifying \"mission impossible\" of the Biocyte Pharmaceuticals invasion that culminates in an electrifying, tense and action-packed scene.\\nAs already mentioned, the lack of rhythm in the plot is notorious. The script chooses to hide its weapons until the final act, when Hunt invades the enemy\\'s headquarters to recover the terrible Chimera virus (whose destructive power seems to have been removed from the epidemic). From there, the action is uninterrupted and we see the director at his best, using all the resources that made him famous: abundant slow motion cameras; radical (and absurd) maneuvers carried out on motorcycles and cars; weapons that seem to take on a life of their own when jumping from side to side; fights full of acrobatics that defy the law of gravity. There is not even a lack of visual signature with the famous pigeons, which transmit charm and elegance to the dark tunnels of the enemy\\'s headquarters and a chilling sequence when one of them flies through the burning door that Ethan just destroyed. We see a chase that passes along the coastal coast, through back roads, through the forest and ends back at the edge of the sea. Motorcycles jumping over the cameras, motorcycles crossing motorcycles, cars exploding and overturning several times; Cruise performing acrobatics, going through the flames with the bike, making it a ski to escape shots, prancing under the front wheel, passing inches from being hit by a car, turning on the axle, taking a hand off the handlebars and shooting at the vehicle - it explodes. The \"heads-up\" between Ethan and Sean in the final chase is a fantastic tribute to the western, one of Woo\\'s great influences. From the insanity of the motorbikes being launched into the air and exploding, to the final fight, in the sand, in a hand-to-hand fight. When the director takes the opportunity to return to the 1970s. To the countless martial arts films he directed in Hong Kong, at the beginning of his career. The fight between Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott is something that the Mission: Impossible franchise would never show again: hand-to-hand combat with a lot of kickboxing and plastic movements. Everything perfectly synchronized with the contagious theme song created by Lalo Schifrin, who this time received a new treatment from Hans Zimmer (it is impossible to leave the cinema without whistling it).If John Woo and Tom Cruise were unable to produce a film that matched the previous one, at least they had a fun, energetic sequence, the most stylized of the entire franchise and of enormous financial success (again). And they established the path that Mission: Impossible would take from then on: a different director for each film, a new approach and a new style. The same universe, always with the same protagonist, but in unique productions, which at the same time that dialogue with those that came before and after, also work in isolation. John Woo fulfills what he proposed with her, conferring yet another unexpected decision on the part of the narrative - still following a very traditional model. Simplicity, however, gets in the way. The viewer expects complex plots. It is observed, therefore, that the intelligence of the first film was abandoned, which requires a less in-depth look from the viewer. As much as it maintains key aspects of the original series, it is a generic action film, easily constituting the weakest entry in the franchise.\"', '\"This is one hell of a movie.  The action scenes are incredible.  The plot is odd, but the end makes up for it.  Better than the first one, I think. And it\\'s worth your $8, so I\\'m pleased.  I don\\'t ask for more than that.\"', '\"I cant believe that Roger Ebert and others praised this stupid excuse of a movie. It had too many scenes that I have seen before in better movies (Like early James Bond). There isn\\'t an original moment in this film. For example when one of the evil conspirators says he doesn\\'t think that they should be doing this and decides to leave - surprise surprise, the henchman helping him on with his coat and scarf strangles him while all the other conspirators watch in amazement. (I saw this scene 20 years ago in a James Bond movie.) Give me a break. Do you believe that the CIA cant communicate with its agents but keep losing them to static and that Ben Afleck as Dr. John Ryan can use the CIA Directors pass and get into the Pentagon and use the HOT LINE Teletype and no one can stop him. The movie is just full of unbelievable scenes, that make it very hard to follow. The ending was total Hollywood and made no sense at all. Waste of time and money to see.\"', '\"I can\\'t express emphatically enough that you should not see this movie. Even for a dumb action movie, the story is ridiculous, the characters are uninteresting, and the villain is generic. Plus, the action is sparse, not very innovative, and edited in an annoying way. What a waste of money.\"', '\"I haven\\'t seen the original movie so I can\\'t be one of the people who says \"this film is better than the original\". I can imagine it being so as i don\\'t care for Sinatra at all. I don\\'t like his attitude or the way he treated people.*spoilers i guess* Ocean\\'s 11 (2001) is a highly enjoyable film hindered by one thing: its lack of excitement. I rate the film highly because of its great dialogue, performances, directing and photography but the fact that absolutely nothing hinders them,drags it down a little in my estimation. There is no point where you are on the edge of your seat going \"oh god how are they going to get out of this little fix\", because no little fixes are presented whatsoever (except for the bit where the Chinese guy gets stuck in the door which he gets out of because they forgot to put batteries in the controller.

This is a fine example of how predictable movies have become and how they are just used to make already famous sellouts like Ja Rule look better, when it just waters down their originality and makes them become mainstream chumps. Well i have too short of an entry so i guess i will talk about how cheesy Vin Diesel is as an actor and this is why we only see him in these over budgeted-for having such a lame plot type of movies, just like Ja Rule. i think this movie was just a waste of money and should not of got so much credit for being a good MOVIE, while in reality it was just a bunch of really nice imports racing about. i like those cars just as much as the next guy, but as a movie its just garbage.\"', '\"Oh, come on, people.

In the adaptation of the old sitcom of the same name, director Joseph McGinty Nichol fabricates an effective glossy style, a jayvee soundtrack, alluring costumes, convincing make-up and set designs, intriguing dialogue, cool cinematography, and a lively mood of comic adventure. The problem? The movie is pointless, underwritten, obvious and does not require the work of a single brain for you to watch.The film doesn\\'t take a lot of time in introducing the whole concept of the Charlie\\'s Angles attitude. The film is based on the popular television program, and it is clear the filmmakers try to be faithful and authentic to the series, but judging by the character development and seemingly spacious motives, it really would not matter if there was a basis for re-writing of the material or not.The movie stars a gifted cast, with Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, and Cameron Diaz taking the title roles as Dylan, Alex, and Natalie. They are three sexy private investigators working for a mysterious man by the name of Charlie, whose identity is kept a secret. Charlie\\'s front man, Bosley (Bill Murray), assigns the three agents to investigate the kidnapping of Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), the founder of Knox Technologies. Knox recently invented an extremely accurate identification program, and the company\\'s president, Vivian (Kelly Lynch) believes his old rival (Tim Curry) is responsible for the kidnapping.When you have a movie like \"Charlie\\'s Angles,\" why even bother with the plot when it consists of a series of stylized action scenes linked together by a lame excuse for a story. Several of the action sequences are entertaining and exciting, and the ending is kind of amusing in its cheesy sort of way, but you will not see a scene this year as ridiculous as the fight sequence where the three heroes battle a man in a dark ally. What is with \"The Matrix\" styled material? It makes us wonder what kind of powers these girls behold.\"Charlie\\'s Angels\" is wonderfully cast, from the leading actress trio to supporting roles from Tim Curry, Luke Wilson, Tom Green, Matt LeBlanc, and LL Cool J, the cast often makes the movie\\'s eye candy more swallowable. But the action is all over the board here. There is no focus or direction to the film\\'s endless boundaries. If it was better directed, maybe \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" would have turned out to be more than mindless fist fights and glossy imagery.\"', '\"Yep, just now getting around to this franchise and it is exactly what I expected: fast cars, fast girls and a fast run time.\"', '\"Spoiler Alert! The new MIB adventure packs more of action then the first film with more of the comedy that occurs in it also. The movie starts off with a retelling of the MIBs oldest cases in the form of a sci-fi myth show narrated by Peter Graves. The story is of the Zarthons and how they want to hide their light of Zartha...the light is \" a cosmic force so powerful that in the wrong hands it could lead to the annihilation of Zartha\" the tale ends with the Zarthons fleeing Earth after being refused to hide the light there by the MIB, they are followed after by Serleena...the stories main antagonist....In the opening Serleena (after some cosmic carnage) landing on earth. She\\'s received a tip from an alien (played by Jackass\\' Johnny Knoxville) saying the light never left earth so goes into motion a race of Jay (rejoined by his mentor Kay) to find the light before Serleena.The movie zips along at a fair pace...I can\\'t believe this is only a 90 Minute movie...but it is and it\\'s fast. Smith and Jones omit the same chemistry that they had in the first film..You can tell these two like working together....but the real star seems to be the effects which areas wild as ever...aliens come in many different shapes and sizes from Jeff the huge ass worm to the worms.....\\nOverall this is a great summer movie and deserves a big box office ranking.... just as memorable as the first...no matter how many times I get flashy thinged...10 out of 10\"', '\"The movie was a blast.  It kept me and the rest of the group I was with on the edge of our seats.  Not seeing it in the theater however, took some of the \"punch\" out of it I am sure.As a \"muscle car\" fan the 69 Charger was really a great addition to the movie.  The newer cars did not do much for me tho. But all in all, the movie was fun and it is a true \"must see again\" flick.\"', '\"You\\'ve all seen them. Kids driving around in their \"souped up\" cars... tinted windows, flashy decals, low profile tires, sweet rims, body kit, wing, and of course the noisy turbo blow-off valve and a few NOS stickers. This movie is basically filled with street-racers doing quarter miles. Meanwhile, Dom and his goons are also stealing car parts. There\\'s a bunch of sub-plots going on here. The movie wasn\\'t all that bad. I watch it from time to time.The bad points: The quarter miles take 5 minutes to complete They manage to reach 160 mph in a quarter mile. Impossible - Not only that, they manage to use their NOS in the quarter miles There are quite a few continuity/editing errors that are easily picked up by anyone who knows something about cars Ja Rule shouldn\\'t act... ever again! The trend that it started.

But don\\'t get caught up in the trend.\"', '\"I must admit I had avoided this film for quite a while, then I happened to catch part of the end at a friends place and decided to give it a go. If you are after a film that will make you think while providing you with a new and interesting look at the world, then this is not the film for you. If you want a film that you can just sit down a watch for alittle bit of fun then I say this is it. Because lets face we\\'ve seen the plot a thousand times before and it\\'s still as predictable as ever, but the film doesn\\'t pretend to have a twister of a plot it\\'s very clear that cars are it\\'s focal point. It\\'s like every other film, if you walk in with certain expectations that aren\\'t met then you\\'ll be let down.

The film is great, the cast is top notch, a real achievement. Overall, 9/10\"', '\"Mission: Impossible - Fallout is coming out next week, so naturally I decided to watch and review every single movie of the franchise. I already wrote my thoughts on Mission: Impossible (1996) and now it is time for the second installment of the saga ... Where we, unfortunately, reach the bottom (better sooner than later).Even though the action stunts are still mostly realistic and very well filmed, they reach a point where I can\\'t buy into them anymore. From two guys colliding mid-air after jumping from their bikes at high speed to explosions spread throughout the entire runtime, this film is pretty bad. 60 minutes into it and there isn\\'t a single action sequence. The suspense and tension, which are a stamp of the first movie, are nowhere near the levels that they used to be, and the slow-motion is excessively employed.The story incorporates a love triangle between Ethan Hunt, Sean Ambrose, and Nyah that feels so strangely awkward and unnecessary. There is an evident James Bond vibe to this film, and that is precisely what wrecked it. This is Mission: Impossible and John Woo almost ruined the whole saga. Tom Cruise\\'s character is an entirely different agent. He transforms himself into this sort of playboy kind of guy who has nothing to do with the Hunt that I know from M:I-1. The whole story hinges on the audience\\'s feelings about his relationship with Nyah, but I can\\'t care enough about Thandie Newton\\'s character because she simply has no depth!Ving Rhames was by far the best secondary character in the first movie. In this one, Luther is just a computer nerd and his funny personality is gone. Dougray Scott plays a boring villain with generic motivations, and everyone else doesn\\'t really matter. There is a severe lack of character development. Nevertheless, the saving grace of M:I-2 is definitely its cast. Newton is very charming as Nyah, Scott makes his awful script more believable and Cruise is ... Well, Tom Cruise.He continues to do all his stunts, and there are some \"money shots\" that he performs exceptionally well. To be honest, this film has some beautiful cinematography and a magnificent Hans Zimmer\\'s score. Even when the action takes itself too seriously, these aspects at least make it bearable. John Woo does a lot of things the wrong way, but he adds some subtle details to his shots that become important to the plot later on.However, this is about it. There are so many cons to overwhelm the pros. The editing is all over the place. The pacing is no longer frenetic as it was in the previous movie. Like I wrote above, I have to wait more than one hour to enjoy some freaking action. The first half of the film is slow and tedious, while the second half starts to accelerate to finish in style. The ending has so much action that most of it becomes stupid. I mean, really stupid. Some moments are supposed to be taken seriously, but it is a tough task not to laugh at the hilarious set pieces.How can a sequel to such a fantastic action movie be so bad? Well, M:I-2 is the undeniable proof. There are so many things gone wrong with this one. John Woo transformed a confusing yet mysterious plot from the first installment into a hilariously awful screenplay. The plot is quite predictable, the story is emotionally weightless, and even the action goes to levels of dumbness that I\\'ve only witnessed in the worst possible films. A great cast and some nice technical details help counterweigh the cons, but Tom Cruise\\'s lead saves the day.\"', '\"While i wasnt big fan of the first film,it still had some good funny conversations and lines that were builded up with chemistry that was awesome in a that film,well in this one it had very little of staff to make it enjoyable watch,first film is defienetly to long for this kind of genre and in many scenes moments were dragging and they could easily be deleted,action scenes are very poorly done with michael bay staff in every corner of them starting with bunch of stupid explosions to lame directed action and fight scenes,will and martin had some good moments in a film,but that was overshadowed by other weak parts of film and his lenght\"', '\"The Fast and the Furious is a perfect movie to it\\'s subject. Turbo sexy cars, great women, fantastic action, and a good strong story, and good acting with Vin Diesel who is awesom and perfect for and in this film, Paul Walker with a really good character for the part and who is very good in this. And Jordana Brewster plays a really good girlfriend and sister.\"', '\"This is a great movie, the funniest action/comidey since Austin Powers. The only way that you could possibly dislike this movie is if you are a massive tool. Cameron Diaz is funny, Drew Barrymore is cute, and Lucy Liu is well Lucy Liu. Crispin Glover is a must see as the Thin Man. He is so totally awesome. Tom Green is funny, and so is Luke Wilson. Matt LeBlanc is useless in his cameo though. Some people are saying that this movie has no plot, it does and it\\'s actually, a good one but you have to pay attention. Those who didn\\'t notice a plot were probably distracted by Cameron Diaz\\'s wiggling booty. But I say if you like action, butkickin females,chain-smokin\\' creepy Thin Men, Bill Murray,plenty of explosions, and a dancing Cameron Diaz (one of the movies funniest scenes) go see this movie now. It\\'s a total blast.\"', '\"Fine Jack Ryan here in much younger, green and definitely clue less on using common sense. Sure in the beginning he has some smarts but wanes just like Cabot\\'s response in the Stadium. John Clark would of been better as Ryan but w/the same direction of the screenplay it still would of sucked, could of been a great film. If Harrison Ford won\\'t do it get Liev Schreiber [John Clark] and have Phillip Noyce direct or John McTiernan and W. Peter Iliff or Larry Ferguson do the screenplay.\"', '\"Totally average Tom Cruise action-adventure with passable plot and expected high production values. Keeps moving and holds attention but is pure entertainment junk food and it isn\\'t even a little bit filling. These 2 hour Mission Impossible films don\\'t really seem to have much more plot to them than the old 50 minute TV series did, and it bugs me that they are just Tom Cruise vehicles, whereas the original series was more interesting because it used an ensemble cast--Peter Graves was not all there was. Also it was annoying how much physical punishment Tom Cruise can take and still keep moving effectively--I know this is supposed to be over-the-top, but it was way, way too much over-the-top here. Overall, I kind of wished I hadn\\'t wasted 2 hours on this, but in the end I\\'ll know doubt watch all of the Mission Impossible Movies-- the first one made no sense, the fourth was pretty solid, this one was disposable, so I guess that only leaves number 3.\"', '\"Let me start by saying I loved the first MIB. The bug, played by Vincent D\\'Onofrio, was hysterical. The movie was alot of fun, Will Smith was Will Smith. Goofy and sarcastic.. Just the right amount of attitude. In MIB 2, he\\'s a bit to serious. Almost seemed like the man was suffering some behind the scenes depression during filming. The plot seemed contrived, as if they wrote it solely to make a sequel, rather than because some writer actually had a great story idea that had to be made into a movie. The movie WAS entertaining, for sure, but on an average level whereas the first MIB was one of those one of a kind hits that likely will never be reproduced. My score: 5 out of 10.\"', '\"Contains PLOT SPOILERS, but nothing major.Bad Boys II is not a movie about a couple of cops.  Sure, that\\'s their \"profession.\"  They have a captain that yells at them when they cause too much property damage.  They are supposed to have search warrants.  But I wouldn\\'t think that cops ever work like this.  Racing down a highway, causing the destruction of 22 cars and a boat?  Taking a helicopter, along with a lot of serious weaponry, into Latin America to save someone\\'s sister with a small war?  Oh wait, that\\'s all irrelevant, cause they\\'re bad cops anyway (no pun intended).  I mean, they typically don\\'t come away with any evidence until the inevitable small war at the end of a case.  They\\'re known by their peers on the force for being crazy.  OK, plot holes explained.Wow, I really loved this movie.  I mean, I\\'ve been anticipating it more than any movie this summer except Matrix Reloaded, but it was still better than anticipated -- an attribute I am always quite pleased to find out.  Are there racist and homophobic jokes?  Yes, but who cares?  They were funny, and we know the filmmakers wouldn\\'t deliberately offend anyone.  Is the film violent?  Yes, and extremely so I must warn, probably moreso than any recent movie.  Be warned about a few corpses that get dropped onto the road during a car chase.  A lot of this violence surprised me in its nature, which is rare, so please be warned.But you know, maybe director Michael Bay is doing us a favor by showing us, under the disguise of a violent movie that is supposed to have all the typical blood and explosions of a summer flick, how some violent acts would really happen.  I mean, if someone is struggling off the side of a car door, while the car is driving up a narrow circling ramp, they might hit a column. If a bomb goes off right in the middle of several people, they will go flying in every direction.  If someone falls flat on their back, due to a mortal wound, in the middle of a mine field, they will probably set off some explosions.  Ok, I\\'m messing around here a bit with my \"rationalizations.\" In truth, Bay probably just kept things so violent because he could.  The R-rated version of Pearl Harbor wasn\\'t shown in theaters.  But the shock value made these quite exciting and amusing action scenes in Bad Boys II really effective.How about Will Smith and Martin Lawrence?  I found them quite amusing, contrary to what many others will hear.  Hopefully this will make some people forget about more recent duds from them (Men in Black II, Black Knight).  By the way, the spanish house blown up towards the end was real. Bruckheimer bought it from people looking for it to be demolished.  And the corpses?  Apparently they were real.  Disturbing.  So for my personal enjoyment, I\\'d definitely give this flick a 10/10.  Since I can handle the excessive violence, I really enjoyed all the thrills.  Awesome car chases. Great shootouts.  Some really funny parts as well.  If I had to be objective, I\\'d probably say 5/10, but like I do with films such as The Phantom Menace and Lethal Weapon 4, I shall try to put objectivity aside.\"', '\"Charlie\\'s Angels is a remake of the 70s series, buy beyond having three female characters in the role of \"special detectives\" that work for a guy named Charlie and a sidekick named Bosley, the resemblance seems to end there. But then, few modern movie rehashes are faithful, so I shan\\'t harp on that point too much.Let\\'s start with the few good parts. The women are beautiful, naturally. Their characters are not as bad as you might think. I think Natalie (Diaz) and Dylan (Barrymore) have some depth to them, and I thought that the juxtaposition of Natalie\\'s real life to her crimefighting life made for some interesting and humorous scenes. Alex (Liu) comes across as the weakest character.The action scenes were intense, but it was here that I began to wrinkle my nose. The action scenes suffer from serious matrix envy. Right now, filming stop action sequences like this are all the rage, but resorting to every visually interesting special effects gimmick at the drop of a hat seem desperate and out of place in the film.The main villain is, well, unconvincing and annoying, and display an over-the-top \"hipper than thou\" attitude that totally shatters any sense of fear or believability in the character. The adrenaline soundtrack and pop-culture references that pervade the movie means that the movie itself also bleeds the same hipper-than-thou attitude.Finally, the movie features the desperately un-funny Tom Green desperately trying to be funny in his all-too-frequent appearances as \"Chad.\"In the final analysis, the film tries to be cute, hip, funny, and action packed, but all of those elements trip over one another in what is little more than an assault on the senses.\"', '\"When I saw all the trash talk crap that some people wrote about in their reviews about this movie, I HAD to disagree. This movie is awesome in my opinion. And no, it did NOT make me want to go out and do 140+ MPH in my car after seeing the movie. There are good performances in this movie. This was the first time I\\'d seen Vin Diesel in a film, and I think this guy is going to be HUGE. Paul Walker isn\\'t bad either, but Vin Diesel stole the show here. The cars were great too, plenty of nitrous-powered, fuel-injected insanity for gear heads (and wannabe gear heads) everywhere. The addition of that black Dodge Charger (!!) just made things that much sweeter. To tell you the truth, I had wanted to see this pretty much ever since it first came out but never had; it was a car-loving ex-girlfriend who finally convinced me to see it a couple years ago. I\\'ve since gotten the DVD myself, and intend to watch it again in the next few days. Overall, a great movie with great action, fast cars (even if they ARE rice burners!), a great storyline, and good characters. Don\\'t listen to the trash talkers, see this movie and form your own opinion!\"', '\"Films  like this are guaranteed money makers - the formula is easy:1. Get a budget of $100m or over 2.

Most of these you can copy from previous films and simple improve a bit 5. Hype the film up with a large marketing campaign 6. Launch the film on a strategic date 7. Make money and relaxIN MY OPINION THERE SHOULD BE REFUNDS FOR FILMS SO BAD!\"', '\"This movie isn\\'t deep or memorable, but it was sure \"cool\" and fun.

All the great scenes in this movie were all in the trailers. There was nothing new. When movies do this it ruins the movie. The acting was not very good and the relationship between cruise and the girl did not work at all. This movie gets 1 out 4 stars.\"', '\"A film like this doesn\\'t happen that often.. kind of a right place, right time moment. For me it is a classic modern movie, with a touch of old school charm. First watched it in 2001 and 18 years later it still is worth rewatching every year. It\\'s not what they do during the film, it\\'s how they do it. Brad Pitt and George Clooney are excellent, Julia Roberts adds so much class and Andy Garcia is perfectly cast for his role. Great ensemble cast too that really keeps the film moving, adds humour and no one is left underused.\"', '\"The Fast and the Furious is not too bad.  The plot line is predictable but is presented in a way that makes it entertaining.  There are some scenes that are not believable and could have been better.  The most glaring are the robbery scenes.  It is just a miss match that is so obvious the director ignores until the end of the film.  The acting of Pawl Walker as Brian O\\'Conner and Vin Diesel as Domminic Toretto are not bad.  There are few difficult scenes that will make you wince but overall it is workable.  The chase scenes are generally good but the opening scenes is painful to watch.  It just does not appear plausible and does not make much sense.  Overall, not bad (7 out of 10).\"', '\"Some 5 years after it was released, Die Another Day has failed to improve with age. Aside from a plot that borrows from Diamonds are Forever and some very poor effects, the film also seems to have some of the most unmemorable locations in any Bond film. Indeed it may be the first Bond not to be filmed in any of the main locations which it is set in. Cornwall doubles for Korea, Spain for Cuba and Norway for Iceland. Much criticism has also been centred on the theme tune by Madonna, alongside her appearance in the movie. Then there\\'s the invisible car. Thankfully the producers released the errors of Die Another Day and the new Casino Royale is superior in everyway. Pierce Brosnan deserved better for his final film as 007.\"', '\"Pierce Brosnan\\'s last outing as James Bond takes place in Die Another Day which finds 007 trying to stop a rogue North Korean general from starting the Korean War all over again with the attending consequences. The North Koreans must have been watching Plan 9 From Outer Space because the gimmick they\\'ve come up with sounds remarkably like what those aliens were warning the Earth against developing.The power of the sun itself is brought into play here. There\\'s a giant mirror in space which seeks to focus and concentrate the sun\\'s energy for peaceful power purposes. But it sure can be an effective weapon of war as we see towards the film\\'s end as Brosnan and his American counterpart agent Halle Berry.Part of the charm of the James Bond series is that you don\\'t take it too seriously, but there are times that it becomes more like Indiana Jones and his narrow escapes than a modern espionage story. Die Another Day takes this point to the extreme.The year before Halle Berry won her Oscar for Monster\\'s Ball and Die Another Day was her next film. Of course she\\'s forever in the record books as the first black woman to win a Best Actress Oscar. But that\\'s for history. I wonder if film fans remember her better as a Bond girl.There\\'s another Bond girl as well, another MI6 agent played by Rosamund Pike. She\\'s one deadly female and most resourceful. Toby Stephens, son of Maggie Smith plays a wealthy industrialist with a mysterious past and a cunning adversary for Pierce Brosnan.One thing I really liked towards the end was Ms. Moneypenny fulfilling her fantasy with James Bond. She\\'s engaged in an early version of the Star Trek holograph deck. The poor woman has been carrying a torch for 007 for almost 50 years now, you\\'d think one of the Bonds would have given her a tumble already. Poor lovelorn Lois Maxwell now Samantha Bond ain\\'t that ironic casting.Die Another Day is not as good as some of the other Brosnan entries in the Bond series, but should satisfy the cult of fans out there.\"', '\"The SFX and also the Makeup by Rick Baker are the Highlights in this Disappointing Sequel to a Surprising Mega-Hit Original. The first Men in Black (1997) captured the Imagination of the Public and the Fascination with X-Files Conspiracies and Space Visitors.The Fact is that Flying Saucer Enthusiast have received No Quarter from the Mainstream Media and have been Mercilessly Ridiculed beginning in the Early 1950\\'s. That Ostracizing is at the Heart of the Comic and the Movies.The Men in Black Movies are based on the Malibu Comics. The Malibu Comic is based on \"Real Life\" Stories that have been around since the Mid-Fifties in Ufology.\"MIB II\" seems as though it is Running on a Warp-Drive that is so Depleted it is having a Serious Spasmosis. Repeating and Regurgitating Ideas and Jokes Ad Nauseum. While it all Looks Great and is Bright and Colorful, it has a Numbing and Familiar Feel.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are put it Front of all the Glitzy Mayhem and Labor Their Parts until, like the rest of the Film, it just becomes Uninspired, Unfunny, and the whole project is left Hanging by Wires and Bobbing about from Scene to Scene. Tim Burton\\'s \"Mars Attacks\" (1996) Succeeded in what this one is Trying to Do and Almost Fails, but Not Quite.There is Enough here to Enjoy in a Prefabricated kind of Product Placing Picture and some of the Homages to Ufology and Conspiracy Theories are Welcomed. Peter Graves Satirical TV Show is an Example as is the Video Store Setting.Overall, Recommended for Fans of the First Film who can Tolerate the Sequel being More of the Same but Not as Good.\"', '\"MI2 is great but not as great as the first, no chemistry between Tom and the girl, pacing problems also. The John Woo action was great as always but we needed more of that. 7 out of 10\"', '\"I\\'m not sure where to start with this film. Honestly, the pain starts with the beginning credits, and keeps up through to the end. Bond is a joke in the film - even to the other characters. No one takes him seriously, or acts like he\\'s remotely threatening. The fact that he was captured, and never escaped? But instead went through what seemed like YEARS of torture -- this character is a sad excuse for James Bond. There are two major female roles in the film, and both of them are awful. Halle Barry\\'s acting is the worst of the film, and her character is completely unbelievable. Her first scene is nearly unbearable, and I found myself wishing she was actually killed off. Rosamund Pike was a bit more tolerable, but not by much. At least her acting was believable, and her voice didn\\'t sound like nails on a chalk board through the entire film.If you\\'ve seen other Bond films, you understand the outrageous villains and wacky action sequences -- but diamonds stuck in someone\\'s face for years? I\\'m nearly positive they would have eventually removed those diamonds from his face -- maybe around the time he started turning into a Caucasian man? The film was extremely racist, and offensive. The message was: It\\'s better to be white. And the giant tsunami at the end? Where exactly does it go? I couldn\\'t wait for this film to be over, it felt like it dragged on forever.The best (and probably only good) thing about this movie was Judi Dench reviving her role as M. I really hope this is Pierce Brosnan\\'s last Bond film.\"', '\"I read the book this was based on many years ago.In Tom Clancys\\' book (if I recall correctly..) it was a Palestinian militant group that recovered the undetonated nuclear payload from an Isreali fighter. This was then used by the group against the United States for it\\'s (perceived, although arguable) propping up of the \\'Isreali Terrorist State\\'.When it came time for Hollywood to make a film of it however things changed course and it was a radical right-wing group working for Aryan(?) supremacy that became the villain.I have to laugh when a book following the fictional, although believable, course of events when a Muslim group bombs the financial backers of the Jewish state gets engineered into \\'euro Nazis\\' attack the U.S for world domination.The idealogical stranglehold of Hollywood continues and anyone who questions it is usually sanctioned and/or accused of antisemitism.Let\\'s see if this one makes it to the board...\"', '\"I thought the original Bad Boys was a fairly good movie as far as Hollywood action comedies go. However in the past 8 years my expectation for movies has hightend a bit, obviously more then Michael Bay\\'s ability to direct movies has. Bad Boys II is basically one long gun fight interrupted by some long car chases and a few weak scenes of dialog.As for the cast, well if you\\'ve seen Bad Boys I then you know the main characters. Will Smith isn\\'t what you would call a great actor. However one has to respect the fact that he has been involved in a few good movies such as MIB. However in my opinion Bad Boys II is probably the worst of \"all\" the bad movies that he has appeared in. Martin Lawrence was as usual terrible to watch, by far one of Hollywood\\'s weakest actors. The addition of Gabrielle Union was the only real good part of the cast. She\\'s a nice little hottie, who is one of the few actors that deliver a decent performance in the movie.Usually I make mention of the sound track. To be honest I can\\'t remember the sound track for this movie, so I doubt it was anything special. Which means it can\\'t have been to bad or I think I might have remembered it.\"', '\"There is not much to say here, no depth, no point, just a bunch of well-known actors in a very fun casino robbery.8/10\"', '\"This is in your face moviemaking. It is so cool and over the top that the movie almost creates a new genre all for itself. It is essentially in the same genre as Desperado. Most critics have misunderstood this movie because it is not suppossed to have a friendly and cheesy atmosphere like most action movies made today. Bad action movies such as XXX and Die Another Day come to mind where no one says a single swear word and never acts irrationally even though they are that close to loosing their life. This is not an innocent and kiddie friendly movie and is not meant for anyone below the age of 17. The only flaw with this movie is that the chase scenes are filmed with too much shaky camera and close ups. But all movies the last couple of years with the exeption of Matrix Reloaded had the same problem. On top of all the action the movie has a lot of humour and is worth the price of admission just for that. I give it 8 out of 10.\"', '\"When you watch a 007 movie, the plot is always predictable: the same formula is being used for years, supported by lots of stunts, special (status-of-art) effects and beautiful and sexy women. Therefore, there is nothing new in this latest James Bond movie. Fortunately North Korea and Cuba do not have petroleum, otherwise the screenplay would probably threat with the beginning of WW3. The character of Jinx (Halle Berry) is supported by an excellent actress with a beautiful face. But trying to make her sexy, maybe because of her role in Monster\\'s Ball, is funny. If you go to the beach in Rio de Janeiro in a summer day, you will find lots of sexier women. Halle Berry does not fit as a \\'Bond girl\\' and she deserves more than that. The movie is not bad, but I myself am tired of the basically same James Bond screenplay, this time with part of John Woo\\'s Face/Off. At least, Triple X is more original. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Um Novo Dia Para Morrer\" (\"A New Day For Dying\")\"', '\"In making this film, director Woo has taken the intensity and exhilaration of the vault break-in sequence in the original M:I movie and expanded it over many of his scenes, making seeing M:I2 an energy rush for the audience. There is none of the tedious and hard-to-follow dialogue of the first movie, and the plot is structured to offer the kind of trickery and twists found in a good espionage story without being so darn confusing. Cruise is skillful in his action yet remarkably genuine in his dialogue and interactions with other characters. This is a pleasant surprise after his presentation of a more cerebral and serious Ethan Hunt in the first film. M:I2 moves quickly, and the fact that Cruise performed his own stunts adds an interesting dynamic to the action that puts viewers on the edge. Thandie Newton also serves as an ideal complement to Hunt\\'s sensuous and sensitive side. She reveals his humanity in the face of peril as well as his will to take action, which ultimately makes Cruise\\'s character more real and intriguing than in the original M:I.\"', '\"This movie is tons of fun to watch. Caper movies are always fun to watch and this one does the job. Tons of humour, great cast and a heist which will blow your mind. I would have liked to see Julia Roberts more in the film but it\\'s made up by the set up of the heist. Everyone is perfectly class and has some very funny scenes. Great job\"', '\"The original Mission Impossible film, starring Tom Cruise as agent Ethan Hunt was a pretty good attempt to update the 60\\'s TV series for a new generation. Sadly the sequel has failed to live up to the modest standards set by its predecessor. Tom Cruise reprises his role, but probably wishes he hadn\\'t.This is a poor excuse for a blockbuster, with dull characters, and a plot that only exists as an excuse for some mind-numbing action. Its style is heavily indebted to the Matrix, a sure sign that nobody had any faith in this franchise\\'s ability to compete on its own terms. This end result is a film that never really establishes an identity of its own. There are one or two effective moments, but they can\\'t outweigh the negative aspects.As if that wasn\\'t bad enough, this is a John Woo film, and so we can\\'t get by without a few of his trademark doves flapping about the place. I\\'ve got nothing against the doves per se, but they\\'re ludicrously out of place here.The performances in this film leave a lot to be desired. Tom Cruise goes through the motions, Thandie Newton\\'s character is unmemorable, and Anthony Hopkins seems totally disinterested, as well he might. Worst of all though is Dougray Scott\\'s horrendously over-the-top villain.What you\\'re left with is a very lacklustre and severely disappointing film, where only the action scenes linger in the mind, and even these are barely original. It only serves to make the original Mission Impossible look even better by comparison.\"', '\"This has to be THE most ridiculous movie I have ever seen. From the creators\\' point of view, if you portray this movie as a potentially realistic thriller, then at least give the audience some credit... Opposing presidents use the CIA-version of IRC-chat to talk to each other in the midst of a mini-nuclear war, helicopters and cars survive a nuclear blast at point blank range, characters travel around the globe at light speed, Israeli\\'s lose a nuke and don\\'t even bother searching for it, and everybody in this movie just seems to be brainless (apart from Mr. Freeman\\'s character, which is probably why he has to die in the first place...)...I thought the other Jack Ryan movies were a joy to watch, and at least you didn\\'t have to worry about incredible plot holes or disbelief over some of the patriotism, stupidity and truths in the movie, but THE SUM OF ALL FEARS really rocks off the scale. I figured having Mr. Clancy as executive producer on this movie should have helped, but he presumably kept in touch through his AOL Instant Messenger.My advice: go see this one (but only if you have some money to spare), but use an open mind, and try to think you\\'re smarter than them...By the way, my rating: 3/10 (I must be in a good mood...)\"', '\"The Grand Central locker aliens, David Cross\\'s video store, Jones\\' memory wipe. Unfortunately, the new character additions are less remarkable; the villains are more annoying than they are funny or threatening, & Dawson\\'s character is...just sort of there. Still, MIBII isn\\'t so much bad as it is just a filler episode of an otherwise decent TV series...with an unwanted & quickly forgotten spin-off. It\\'s the Friends\\' episode featuring \"Joey\\'s Interview\"...& \"International\" is \"Joey\".\"', '\"Sorry, I obviously differ from most of the raters. This film was heavy on special effects which often made no sense whatsoever. Along with a mediocre plot and an unbelievable villain, this movie needs to be tossed in trash cans everywhere.\"', '\"In that this film can be described in three simple words: Big, Loud and above all, Pointless.The story was barely beyond one-dimensional (the ending was so so telegraphed, it defies description) as was the acting. Paul Walker find another profession or you will end in the roles that Wings Hauser would turn down.On the upside, there were the car stunts, which were stunning and my marks for this film is because of those stunts only.2 out of 10 for the stunts. A flat zero for everything else.\"', '\"This was my favorite action movie of 2000. No questions asked. I thought it was better than the first because it was easier to understand, and there is more fighting sequences. The motorcycle scene is by far the best scene in the movie. I own this movie on DVD, and I\\'ve watched at least 5 or 6 times. I don\\'t get it with you people. I thought you were looking for a non stop action film. In my movie shelf this is one of the best ones. On DVD the sound is outstanding, the rockclimbing scene is awesome. The beginning of the movie is a bit hokey though, especially the tap dancing part. Another cheesy part is when Ethan and Nyah all of the sudden fall in love. When the mission starts, the great stuff starts. The thing I thought we were looking for, the action. The action is as great on DVD as it is on the big screen. So if you\\'re looking for a movie that has great action, pick up MI-2 at the movie store on DVD if you have DVD. It has a simple plot. You people say that this movie has doesn\\'t have a plot. If you want to see a movie that has a plot looks like a four year old wrote, see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. MI-2 gets a 10/10.\"', '\"Don\\'t trust the promos on this one... The movie is actually quite entertaining... The basic premise of the movie is the same as in Chan\\'s \\'Rush Hour\\'-- Foreigner comes to States to rescue kidnapped victim, cultures clash, and lots of Chan\\'s original style of action/fight scenes occur....The difference between Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon, is the lack of Chris Tucker... which allows Chan\\'s subtler form of humor to shine. Shanghai Noon also has more fight scenes than Rush Hour, though not as many as Chan\\'s non-U.S. films.The movie is definitely worth watching, especially if you are a Jackie Chan fan... Just try not to let the promos fool you.\"', '\"while i enjoyed the first Bad Boys movie,quite a bit,i was absolutely blown away by this one.the action in this one is off the scale,and the movie is even funnier.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence returns as the two Miami detectives from the original.there are teamed up again to solve another huge case.this time they have some professional and personal issues with each other,which add to the drama.there is one spectacular car chase,which is admittedly unrealistic,but very exciting to watch.there is still the same comedic banter between the two,which helps to slow the frenetic pace down once in awhile.like i said,this movie blew men away.the intensity of it stayed with me even after the end credits rolled.i\\'ll admit,there\\'s less story in this one,but there is enough of one to keep it interesting.as for the action scenes,i haven\\'t seen anything like that in a long time.for me,Bad Boys 2 is superior to the original.i give it 9/10\"', '\"No matter how many times I watch this movie, it never gets old. Steven Soderbergh has remade a classic and updated the style for the twentieth century. The movie centers on freshly-paroled Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his plot to rob three Las Vegas casinos in one night. The movie grabbed me at the first scene and I was entertained until the end. The two components that make this movie what it is are the spectacular cast and the intricate heist plan.For a movie with thirteen characters, Soderbergh and screenwriter Ted Griffin did a great job of giving each enough screen-time and personality to make them each interesting. Clooney and Brad Pitt are charismatic as usual in their roles as the heist\\'s ringleader and primary accomplice. Andy Garcia is cold and calculating as the owner of the targeted casinos. Though, some of the best performances come out of the supporting cast. A lot of the movie\\'s best scenes feature Bernie Mac, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and Elliot Gould. Julia Roberts is a bit under-used in her role as Tess, Danny\\'s ex-wife, but makes for a pleasant distraction. Playing just as large a role as any person in this film is the setting, Las Vegas. We are treated to great visuals of Vegas and it gives the movie a grander, flashier vibe.The heist in this movie is definitely complex, and there are still parts I\\'m not too clear on. I also felt that they got a little too high-tech during the vault break-in (i.e. the little \"knock-out\" disc and the getaway van). Other than a couple hiccups, the heist was fun to watch build up and come to fruition. Soderbergh did a great job revealing little details throughout that seem insignificant until you see the end result.Steven Soderbergh\\'s remake of a classic caper makes a great popcorn flick. It\\'s got sharp humor, great performances, and an intelligent design that almost makes you think, \"That just might work...\". There may be a couple plot holes but that never slows the movie down. So, check this out if you haven\\'t already...and keep an eye out for the cocktail waitress that gets clothes-lined during the chaos. It\\'s probably one of the funniest images in the whole thing.\"', '\"The Sum of All Fears is an entertaining movie, but it\\'s plot is inconceivable.Warning, do not read if you want to be surprised by the movie.1. The Israelis would never have left a nuke lying around in the Golan Heights.  If they sent up a jet with a nuke on board and it got shot down, they would have immediately sent in a recovery team in order to prevent that bomb from falling into the wrong hands.  I don\\'t care if they were at war, that\\'s a risk they can\\'t afford to take.2. Given the events of September 11, 2001 the US will never say anything to Russia about what they do to the Chechneyans.  If the Russians were to nuke them, poison them, etc. We will look the other way, as the Russians fight their war on terror, we will be free to fight ours.3. How the hell did the Russians know where our Stealth Bombers were?  I thought the whole idea of a stealth bomber is that you can\\'t see it on radar, which is what makes it so dangerous.4. Why did the Neo-Fascists order the attack in the first place, it\\'s not like that guy was a leader of a nation or something.  Even with the US and Russia out of the way, he still wouldn\\'t have had any power.Still the movie was interesting.  The special effects were good, the story was fairly chilling, given the events of September 11, and the standoff currently going on between India and Pakistan.\"', '\"This is one of those eye candy type of movies.  Great stunts, special effects, sound and cinematography (and lots of cool cars, if you are into that.)  But the story was a version of the Point Break story, with extra helpings of stupidity and inplausibility.  The characters are VERY thin, which fits right in with the rest of the script.  Amazingly, the DVD of this movie is quite well done, with excellent dts sound and a widescreen video. Lots of extras too, although I didn\\'t bother to look at any of them (like I really want the director\\'s commentary on this crap!)  I give this one a 3/10 for the eye candy, but don\\'t bother to turn on your brain if you watch it. Just enjoy the show.\"', '\"Following an initially intriguing premise, the narrative of this Bond movie takes every ludicrous turn possible in order to force any cheap-jack interest it can get. Consequently, every time the film falls in a trap set by itself it simply resorts to inanity to get back on track, brackishly exclaiming its Bondian identity. The producers might have thought that this was a smart thing to do, but the joke is utterly played at the audience\\'s expense: We are aware of Bond\\'s invincibility from the outset therefore what we\\'d rather see is the upping of the stakes in the thrill factor than consistent provocation of smug self-reference. And since the narrative itself -the movie\\'s spinal cord- is so hideously marred, dullness sets in within half hour into the film. There are flaws elsewhere as well. The film lacks the imaginative depth to sustain a plot device such as an \\'ice-palace\\', the much-publicized CGI special effects are not special at all (they are often laughable), the hyped-up battle between the Aston Martin and the Jaguar is woefully inter-cut with scenes of Jinx getting drowned, director Tomahori constantly attempts to give Jinx a more prominent stage to the point of making Bond a second banana, and the climax is so laboriously shot on foot that feels as if it ends before it even starts. A dismal case of a Bond picture the kind of which hopefully we\\'ll never have to experience again, and a major warning to the producers that Bond should be tampered by people who love the material rather than just appreciate it.\"', '\"Charlie\\'s Angels was apparently terrible. But, I\\'m not ashamed to say that I strong enjoyed myself during Charlie\\'s Angels, it was mindless entertainment that all audiences can enjoy.Charlie\\'s (an unseen John Forsythe) private investigation company is addressed by programmer Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), owner of Knox Technologies, whose revolutionary voice-recognition software has been stolen. Charlie\\'s angels, Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) are sent to place a bug in the system of bitter rival Roger Corwin, who is under strong suspicion. But after the deed is done, the Angels and their boss Bosley (Bill Murray) face the fact of a destroyed home base as well as Charlie\\'s life in immediate danger. But how do you protect someone you never met? Although the film is dumb and silly, it is irresistible and entertaining all at the same time. The explosions and many other death scenes are done in entertaining, clever and creative ways while the characters are all likeable (apart from the baddies). Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu obviously all had a brilliant time making Charlie\\'s Angels, while director Joseph McGinty Nichol looks like he had a blast ordering them around nicely!Silly, enthralling fun that deserves to take up your time if your in the mood for a kick-ass movie.I rate Charlie\\'s Angels 7 out of 10.\"', '\"Besides being one of Hollywood\\'s most expressive actresses, Drew Barrymore proves once again she is one of its savviest producers. Her take on CHARLIE\\'S ANGELS is goofy, cotton candy fun, an terrific evolution rather than remake of the original television series. These three genius airheads (Barrymore, Diaz, Liu) fascinate with their intelligence, arouse us with their looks (for the record, Liu has the best bottom, Barrymore the best bust and Diaz the best all around figure), and entertain us with their cheerleader perkiness; the original angels seem positively arthritic compared to these girls.Evidence that the savvy Barrymore knows her stuff: the film sidesteps the gun issue by having the girls use martial arts and bows and arrows instead of guns.  Within the story\\'s context, this decision makes perfect sense.  However, it does inadvertently point out that guns are PRIMARILY used to AVOID violence when subduing an adversary.  Eschewing firearms, the Angels must resort to kicking butt, opening the Townsend agency to a nasty \"excessive force\" lawsuit, not mention causing unnecessary injuries to both friend and foe. The chemistry between Diaz, Barrymore and Liu is unmistakable.  Barrymore has graciously given her costars more \"showy\" roles. In fact, Barrymore tends to come across as a bit more of a bimbo than either Diaz or Liu.  Nonetheless, all three Angels acquit themselves very well. NOTE TO BARRYMORE:  Don\\'t waste your money on Bill Murray as Bosley. There are lot\\'s of character stars whom would be just as good.  In fact, Murray was a bit of a distraction.  A viewer always expects a \"star\" like Murray to have more to do.  They can\\'t help but be disappointed when he doesn\\'t.As pure escapist entertainment, CHARLIE\\'S ANGELS, is an even more pleasing movie-from-tv series than either THE FUGITIVE or any of the STAR TREK films. This is eye candy and junk food for the mind.Note to Diaz. You make a great looking redhead.  You out to go for that look for a while.Oh, and one last note to Drew.  Ditch the eye makeup.  You don\\'t need it, and in that scene with you in the jumpsuit at the track, I ASSURE you, NOBODY was looking at your EYES.\"', '\"The hype for the re-make of the early 60`s film \"Oceans 11\" starring Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. had some \"hype\" for it but did it live up to it`s expectations?I think the movie was fair it had a slight amount of interest that you can enjoy it but it seemed that it was slightly just not there.I was an OK movie that you can enjoy and the 2 hours of the movie go bye very fast.Some of the rolls had either not enough of that character or too much.I enjoyed this movie but it just was not what the media said it would be.I muct say George Clooney,Matt Damon,Bernie Mac,Carl Reiner,and Don Cheadle give good performances,but Julia Roberts just did not click and there was too much of Andy Garica.This movie is something you can wait to come out on video.But as a suggestion I would say if you want a slightly more serious movie see \"The Score\" starring Robert De Niro,Edward Norton,Angela Bassett,and Marlon Brando,that movie has interest in it and a smart sassy cast that sizzles.But Ocean`s 11 is  an OK movie and you should wait to see it and see something a little more worth while.\"', '\"I think this is one of the cheapest sequel I\\'ve seen in many years.I guess I was really disappointed since I\\'d really like the first movie. In a nutshell, nothing new. Same old agents, same old gadgets, same old plot.Will Smith tends to overacting and this time he\\'s at the edge of caricature.\\nAs for the aliens. Many, too many Aliens has been created here. Most of them are totally ridiculous. From the bright Yellow and Red Chickenish alien to the huge wtfisthat sort of tentacle thingy which takes half of the agency all by itself.About the plot. One mean Alien kills everyone in his(her) way in order to get something from earth back. Does it ring a bell ? Well for me it\\'s the same plot as the first one. Except this time it\\'s not some bug in Edgar Suit but the Hot Lara Flynn Boyle.And the end of the movie, Oh my god ! foreseeable as it can be. The thing is, it is so lame I kept saying to myself that they could not come with something that cheap. And guess what they did it.So the best advice I can give you is to wait for this movie to be on TV and to watch it if you don\\'t have anything more exciting to do (you would have more fun doing your laundry)\"', '\"\"If you need time, go out and buy the magazine.\" Okay so it won\\'t let me just type one line and be cool ;o) I must say I am glad I didn\\'t pay my own money to see this movie. I mean the cars were nice, well one car at the end was nice, and the racing was cool. But the acting was TERRIBLE, dialog was a minus 10, story line was simply boring. There are some good looking people in this movie though ;o)\"', '\"I didn\\'t expect much out of this movie, that\\'s probably why I enjoyed it. The plot is ridiculous and full of holes.  The directing isn\\'t too great, either.  But, I enjoyed the movie.This move is the full of over-hyped features.  They went way overboard on the fighting scenes.  They definitely were taking advantage of the looks of Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore.  In fact, it was so over the top, you have to realize that\\'s what they are spoofing!I couldn\\'t count all the stereotypes that you see in this movie.  It\\'s not meant to be great cinema.  It\\'s meant to entertain.  I don\\'t need to watch the movie 20 times to decypher its message.  So, for entertainment value, I give it 7 out of 10 stars.\"', '\"\"Men in Black II\" is so lightweight that it doesn\\'t merit a lengthy review, so I\\'ll keep it brief.This movie was a big disappointment.  Its main problem?  It\\'s not funny. About 95% of the jokes fall flat and Frank the talking dog gets annoying after only a short time on screen.  I know what to expect from blockbuster sequels, so I didn\\'t go into the theater expecting an \"L.A. Confidential\" style plot or \"American Beauty\" level acting.  But I do want it to deliver where it should: in comedy, in pyrotechnics and special effects.\"MiB II\" fails in all three areas.  It also took WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too long to get to Tommy Lee Jones.  Hard to believe, considering this movie is about 85 minutes long, but the filmmakers pull it off.  This sequel lacks all the charm and originality of the original, which I heartily enjoyed.In the end, this movie proves to waste two thoroughly likeable characters as they spit out an endless series of lame jokes.  Based on early box office returns, this movie is going to be huge.  But if you\\'ve not yet seen it, I say wait for the video.Rating: 5/10\"', '\"\"The Fast and the Furious\" is basically your standard summer blockbuster - stupid, loud, and lots of explosions.  Amazingly, this movie sinks to depths that most summer blockbusters have never reached.The story surrounds an undercover FBI agent (Paul Walker) who is trying to find out who has been stealing electronics equipment.  This leads him to a group of underground street drag racers.  Despite the numerous plot holes, such as the idiotic way in which the criminals go about stealing the equipment, and Walker\\'s inexplicable behavior, this movie actually could\\'ve been good.  The premise is interesting, and the drag racing scenes are fairly exciting.Where this movie falters is the characters.  None of them are interesting, and despite the script\\'s best efforts, they are all two-dimensional.  The performances are awful, with the exception of Vin Diesel, who is merely average.  Walker delivers his stupid catch phrases inconvincingly monotone. Perhaps the script is much to blame here, for I\\'ve often believed that good performances are highly influenced by the script, i.e. a good actor can give a bad performance if the dialogue is bad.  Well, anyway, the dialogue is simply some of the worst in any big budget movie I\\'ve seen recently.On the plus side, the action sequences are pretty good.  However, this simply cannot make up for a senseless script and horrible acting.  Not really worth seeing, unless you really like action, with nothing to back it up.* 1/2 out of ****\"', '\"Corny crap just about covers all its stand out qualities.\"', '\"Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson star in a 19th century Western, where Imperial Guard Chon Wang (Chan) of China\\'s Forbidden City attempt to rescue the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) in the United States. There, he meets small time robber Roy O\\'Bannon (Owen Wilson) and together they go through misadventures, until they finally band together to find the Princess and rescue her people.This is basically a good old fashion western comedy featuring Chan\\'s signature martial arts moves and Wilson\\'s mellow and friendly attitude yearning for grandeur. You put the two characters together and you\\'ll get a love-hate friendship and partnership that is mildly entertaining to watch.The plot is quick-paced, helped by the story\\'s many adventures and fast action from the characters. The clash between the east and west cultures and stereotypes are amusing and harmless enough to keep the film interesting.

The credibility of this epic 133 minute extravaganza suffers mildly from some hopelessly unrealistic but nevertheless exciting predicaments that challenge our globe trotting British secret service agent. Ultimately, New Zealand director Lee Tamahori doesn\\'t let Ian Fleming fans down and he directs with a vivid sense of flair. Despite its outlandish reliance on obvious computer generated imagery, this inventive Bond adventure qualifies as one of the better 007 sagas and a fitting conclusion for the Brosnan Bond. The ice chase is the primary culprit here as well as the chief villain\\'s frozen Icelandic residence. Interestingly, \"Die Another Day\" incorporates African conflict diamonds in its serpentine plot, four years before the fashionable Edward Zwick thriller \"Blood Diamond\" (2006) with Leonardo DiCaprio dealt with these controversial gems. Naturally, Judy Dench returns as Bond\\'s superior M, and John Cleese was on his own for the first and last time as Q. The most incredible gadget that Bond receives is an invisible Aston Martin with the usual arsenal of weapons. Toby Stephens and Rick Yune make two audacious villains and \"Reservoir Dogs\\'\" Michael Madsen appears as a duplicitous, high-ranking C.I.A. executive. \"World Is Not Enough\" scenarists Neal Purvis & Robert Wade maintain the larger-than-life action with exotic locales, lovely ladies, but a somewhat darker tone. Bond amounts to a renegade British Intelligence agent out for revenge against those vile dastards who framed him for security transgressions that he would never made. In some ways, Purvis and Wade were inspired not only by John Glen\\'s \"Octopussy\" with North Koreans committing criminal acts just as the renegade Soviets but also Guy Hamilton\\'s \"Diamonds Are Forever\" with a villain who commands a satellite constructed of diamonds. Hardcore 007 fans will spot the encore of Commander Bond\\'s small \"Thunderball\" underwater breathing gadget. \"Die Another Day\" opens on the Pukch\\'ong Coast of North Korea as 007 and two other agents surf into the beach. Bond and his companions steal an attachÃ© case filled with diamonds from Mr. Van Bierk (Mark Dyman of \"Until Death\") and appropriate Bierk\\'s helicopter to fly to a secret rendezvous in the de-militarized zone in North Korea. Bond places two bricks of C-4 explosives with a timer under the diamond trays and set off to keep an appointment the arrogant Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee of \"Elektra\"), son of General Moon (Kenneth Tsang of \"The Replacement Killers\"), who has no qualms about trading arms for African conflict diamonds during a U.N. embargo. Moon\\'s second-in-command, Zao (Rick Yune of \"The Fast and the Furious\"), takes a digital picture of Bond and uploads it to the Internet. He shares the results with Colonel Moon and they discover that Van Bierk is really a British assassin named James Bond. Immediately, Colonel Moon arrests Bond and destroys the helicopter with a tank-busting weapon. General Moon calls his son because he is approaching the de-militarized zone where he has his headquarters. Hastily, Colonel Moon orders his men to disperse and take the weapons with them. He orders Bond executed, but the explosives in the attachÃ© case ignite and Bond escapes. Zao is stricken by a shower of diamonds that embed themselves in his face. Colonel Moon and Bond battle it out on the hovercraft that Moon used to transport the weapons to the location. Thousands of land mines on the border of North and South Korea pose no problem to Moon because the hovercraft can float harmlessly float over them. Bond and Moon exchange small arms fire and Moon even resorts to a flame thrower. They run out of room to maneuver and Moon plunges over the edge of a cliff while Bond seized a bell and survives. \"Saved by the bell,\" he quips until he sees General Moon arrive with an army. Moon takes Bond and turns him over to North Korean interrogators and during the title credit sequence, Bond is tortured. Eventually, months after his arrest, Bond is released as part of an exchange for Zao. M (Judy Dench) isn\\'t pleased to see 007 because not only did Zao kill three Chinese agent when he tried to blow up a summit meeting, but also because British Intelligence suspects that Bond spilled his guts and a deep mole in North Korea was exposed. M gets Bond out to ensure that he doesn\\'t expose more agents. Bearded and ragtag, Bond vows to get the individual who set him up. He escapes from British Intelligence and begins his search for that mysterious person. Initially, he heads to Cuba to find Zao. Several things differentiate Brosnan\\'s final outing as the redoubtable civil servant earlier as well as later entries. First, the bullet is finally seen entering the gun barrel during the pre-credit sequence. Thus far this represents the one and only time that this has occurred in the series. Second, the title theme sequence continues the narrative with Bond enduring torture while incandescent women appear on screen and scorpions are seen scuttling about to Madonna\\'s song. Third, this is the only time that James Bond appears with a full beard, giving Brosnan look like a 17th century buccaneer. Fourth, the initial action transpires in Korea, the first time that this location with its volatile real life implications for possible nuclear war has been appropriated. Fifth, the plot later takes 007 from places like Cuba to Iceland. Sixth, the C.I.A. has its own agent out there in the form of Halle Berry\\'s Jinx Johnson. Seventh, the pre-credit sequence qualifies as one of the livelier ones with Bond battling a crazed North Korean colonel as they sweep over a mine field in hovercraft blasting away at each other with machine guns and flamethrowers. As usual, Bond still finds the time for the classical throwaway witticism and the women are seductive.\"', '\"When writing this there have been 6 fast and furious films and I cannot see why after this first film. It\\'s not a particularly bad film but I cannot see any reason for so many sequels. The acting is ok at best and the storyline was quite poor so surprised it has got as far as it has.\"', '\"How can you fault a flick that has Bill Murray and Tim Curry battling in giant Sumo suits?!? A flick that has Crispin Hellion Glover at his twisted best? Cameron Diaz shakin ass and acting like a complete manic? Drew Barrymore lookin hot! Lucy Liu showing freckles!The only disappointment was Drew Barrymore\\'s LAME moon walk!\"', '\"This is really a good Jackie Chan flick. The action is good and plenty, the stunts are unbelievable and hard to follow and there are many, many big laughs. OK this one is not only good stuff (which film is nowadays) and there are a few scenes I\\'d rather had not seen or would have, but only if altered, but these are not frequent enough to spoil the film. If these scenes had been good it would have got this film a 9 or 10 easily. The supporting cast is good too, especially Owen Wilson, who I had already seen before in The Haunting, but in that film I only thought he had a weird nose and nothing more. In this one he is different though and not only pretty good at what he does, but funny too. The bad guy, or better guys are doing their job, nothing more, some better than others and quite frankly, some more irritatingly than others. The female supporting cast is good as well, there are two females here, Lucy Liu and Brandon Merrill , the latter one unknown, who both act good and who just happen to be pretty as well, so no criticism about the cast here. All in all this film has a good supporting cast plus everything that has made Chan what he is today. That means there are bloopers at the ending you do not want to miss. The bathtub blooper really is darn hilarious.\\n8 out of 10\"', '\"\"The Fast and the Furious\" is a movie that surprised me big time because I didn\\'t think I would like it. It didn\\'t look all that great when I saw the previews of it, and I was dreading that I would have a miserable time watching it when some friends talked me into seeing the film with them. By the end of it, I was incredibly surprised at how much I liked this movie. It\\'s not one of the best movies ever made, but it kept me interested from start to finish. \"The Fast and the Furious\" is about drag racing in L.A., and focuses on a young undercover cop who falls into a group of professional drag racers who just might be the same ones who\\'ve been participating in a series of truck hijackings. The young cop tries to get to the bottom of this by becoming close friends with the leader of this group. Here for once is a movie that features car races and chases with the use of real cars, not special effects. It\\'s at its best when the action takes place behind the wheel, and these scenes keep you on the edge. Plus, it has a story that works because it\\'s interesting. Paul Walker (as the cop) and Vin Diesel (as the group leader) are given good material to work with, and both actors play their characters well. You get to know these two guys, and you can\\'t help but wonder what\\'s going to happen to them in the end. That makes \"The Fast and the Furious\" an even better film. Good acting, good story, and good action make this film a surprise winner.*** (out of four)\"', '\"Mr. Bay has woven a rather fine little film here, throwing aside any narrative concerns in favour of gleeful destruction and wild swagger. The film is a Grand Guignol, a veritable schmorgasbord of over-the-top delights. This film, however, is not for the faint of heart or delicate of mind - Mr. Bay revels in detailing the most vile dismemberment, the most foul obscenities and all manner of combustion. Marvelous!\"', '\"Although George Clooney always seems to play some deviation of the same character, his movies tend to surprise me.Ocean\\'s 11 is nothing new.  Not even close.  Not only a remake, but the same rehash of plots from SNEAKERS to ENTRAPMENT to even SUGAR & SPICE.  In other words, if you are looking for fresh air from a movie, this is not your ticket.If you are looking for some nice, sleek entertainment boxed in the now typical two hour formula, then Ocean\\'s 11 might be for you.  Clooney is, well, the same Clooney as he always is, but does a nice job with it.  He and Brad Pitt do a decent job of playing \"The Buddies Setting Up The Heist\" routine and the other cast members range from good to adequate.  It\\'s just a story, that\\'s all it is.  It is not a classic, but it is something that you can sit a watch and not feel like you wasted your time at the end - As long as you do not go in looking for trend setter.If you are really hankering for an ensemble cast crime drama, try any of THE GODFATHER(\\'s), BEAT THE DEVIL, TOUCH OF EVIL, THE USUAL SUSPECTS.7/10 - Just entertainment.\"', '\"This movie might be utterly predictable, cliched with, one suspects, unintentionally funny dialogue, but as a moving comic book it is a passable way of spending a couple of hours when you really don\\'t have anything else to do.   Hey,what do you expect - Pinter?   The hokey plot borrows from any Bond movie - pick one at random - and this spy-turned-traitor business is getting real tired.   However, some of the action sequences are eyecatchingly staged even when the fight scenes drag on ad nauseam, and if John Woo\\'s trademark balletic slo-mo shoot-outs are getting a little tiresome, well there\\'s always Limp Bizkit on the soundtrack.\"', '\"New millennium, 20th film, 40th anniversary...What do you do? Do a lot of references of the previous films with an invisible car. This was Bond over the limit, where we critics and fans draw the line telling it to calm the F down!This film was released in 2002 coinciding 40 years of the release of the 1st film, Dr. No (1962). Let\\'s rewind a year before...On 11th September, 2001. That day shocked the entire world which Americans with the world will never forget in living memory. After that appalling date. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had to reposition themselves where to take Bond in the post 9/11 era. So... Bond was shut off after Die Another Day (2002) for a good 4 year hiatus.\"', '\"It\\'s a great movie but something in it reminds me of the old car theft movie with Charlie Sheen (29 seconds??).

But came up with a better movie!!\"', '\"**No spoilers here - I couldn\\'t spoil this movie**I wouldn\\'t say The Fast and Furious is a bad movie, as someone might think I intended \"bad\" to be \"good\".  It is the antithesis of good.What I didn\\'t like:  The acting is horrible.  The plot is non-existent. The dialogue is stupid.  The love interest isn\\'t interesting.  The stunt driving is ridiculous.  It takes \"10 second\" cars a couple minutes to go a quarter mile.What I liked:  (this space intentionally left blank)\\nI love cars.  I love car movies.  The Fast and Furious is boring and stupid.\\nI enjoyed the closing credits the most.  But I watched them with the sound down to avoid the crap soundtrack.  All in all, this is a total waste of time and film.0/10\"', '\"How sad.  You can see the effect that movies like \"XXX\" and \"The Matrix\" have had on our beloved Bond series.  Apparently the new formula is to abandon all sense of intrigue, make the action scenes even more over the top than in the not-very-good later Roger Moore movies (amazingly, it turns out this is actually possible), and throw in a Bond cliche every other scene.It\\'s one thing to give a little nod here and there to earlier Bond flicks. It\\'s another to senselessly smash the audience over the head with every Bond cliche in the book.  Even the name is an incredibly lame compilation of Bond cliches...  \"Let\\'s see, you take something about life or death, something about time... put that into the Bond cliche generator...\"  Come on.  We\\'ve already had \"License to Kill\", \"The Living Daylights\", \"You Only Live Twice\", \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", and \"Live and Let Die\".  We get it already, it\\'s a James Bond film.But the sad thing is, it\\'s not really.  It\\'s only a Bond film in name and cliche.  Sure Pierce Brosnan fits the part well, and sure the girls swoon appropriately, the cars are fast, the music is Bondian and I\\'m sure the Martinis were shaken, not stirred.  But James Bond is not Xander Cage, and I don\\'t want to see him snowboarding his way through 94 minutes of action sequences.  There used to be some plot and character building to Bond movies, sure it was tongue-in-cheek but it was there and it wasn\\'t just plain stupid.The only thing that comes close at all in this movie is the scenes where Bond spends what seems to be a couple of years in a North Korean prison, and who wants to see that?  The Sean Connery Bond would have escaped from that prison in the first day, and if he couldn\\'t pull that off he would have found a hot North Korean chick to let him go in exchange for some James Bond sex and an empty promise.I think this may finally spell the beginning of the end for this venerable franchise.  They have finally lost the actual Bond flavor and are stupidly attempting to replace it with \"XXX\"/\"Matrix\"-style action.  To which I am sure audiences will eventually say \"Who cares?  I\\'m going to see XXX6 because my brain has been shrunk below the point required to understand something as simple as a James Bond movie.\"\"', '\"I am stunned at some of the negative reviews I\\'ve read on here.  I\\'m not a Jackie Chan fan and have seen a couple of his movies and thought they were alright, but this one I watched twice and busted out laughing both times.  I think this is a very funny, clever movie and Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson were hilarious.  The script was well written, the story line was great, the action was great, the acting and humor was fantastic.  I say I\\'m not a Jackie Chan fan but if he continues to make movies such as this I will be one.  Great movie!!!!!\"', '\"Bad Boys II takes everything the last film did and ups it to the next level. The action is fast paced and a lot of fun without being too ridiculous. The comedic pairing of Smith and Lawrence is even better here because of the time that\\'s past to make their relationship feel more authentic. Unfortunately, the film\\'s runtime is also increased by nearly 30 minutes from the previous film and its mostly unnecessary filler moments that feel like they don\\'t have much bearing on the actual plot. Granted a couple of these scenes are fun (we all love that Reggie scene) but most just bring the film to a crawl.\"', '\"Ocean\\'s Eleven comes pretty close to representing perfectly the epitome of entertainment. It really is great fun throughout and great credit for this goes to the splendid cast with George Clooney and Brad Pitt in particular on top form. In fact, i would nearly go as far as to say that its Clooney\\'s best role of his entire career. The look of the movie is fantastic and the great soundtrack also adds a great dimension. The fact that the movie was filmed on location in Las Vegas and in an actual casino made the whole experience seem very realistic. Definitely one of the most enjoyable movies produced by Hollywood in recent years.\"', '\"I really liked the first Mission Impossible film.  It had a very good spy/thriller feel to it and actually seemed more like a Mission Impossible t.v. episode.  This one was okay but it should not have been called Mission Impossible 2.  It\\'s nothing like what Mission Impossible is supposed to be. It feels more like another version of James Bond.  I notice so many are trying to copy Bond these days (and most of them unsuccessfully).  This is a decent outing as a James Bond copy, though it still bothers me that it wasn\\'t just given a different name.  Also another complaint is that all of the mask stunts and even the cigar cutter thing were copied straight from Darkman.  I would recommend that any of you who thought the mask stunts were good to go out and rent Darkman (it\\'s a lot better at pulling these stunts off).  I will give this movie credit for acting.  It had better actors than the typical action film.  So if you want to see this movie then fine but i would still recommend Darkman or just a Bond flick more highly.\"', '\"Okay...this was awesome!  To begin with I am an action film fanatic and this had all the right stuff in that department, car crashes, chases, explosions, gun violence...ect.  Then it has the one thing that completely won me over: T.C. with long hair and leather....and a villian (D.S.) who is not as sexy as T.C. but comes damn near close....to relate this in terms of leather wearing guys, Keanu is nothing compared to T.C.  Remember to catch this one in theaters so you can see T.C. larger than life....\"', '\"The evil duo in this film reminded me of Hudson Hawk\\'s Darwin and Minerva Mayflower (Richard Grant and Sandra Bernhard).  That was not a fond memory. And the Matrix-style (as copied in \"Mission Impossible 2\") action sequences don\\'t play as well in real life as they do in VR.  I haven\\'t been this disappointed in a film since \"End of Days\", and that was a much better film. But it wasn\\'t as bad as \"The Avengers\".  The only positive (other than gratuitous cleavage) was Bill Murray\\'s performance.  He did bring a few laughs to the crowd.  And no, I couldn\\'t tell where they did the FX to remove Drew Barrymore\\'s \"cottage cheese\" from her thighs.\"', '\"The best of all the oceans movies but I still can\\'t work out how they got away\"', '\"John Woo once again proves to be a master of cinema with this blockbuster.  Great acting, phenomenal action, and tons of face-ripping, M:I 2 is a MSIT (Must-See-In-Theater) flick.Tom Cruise again does a great job as superspy Ethan Hunt, but this time has a much better script to work with.  His character seems more fleshed out and real than the short-haired spy-on-the-run we met in 1996.  While he and love interest Thandie Newton never quite click, he and supervillain Dougray Scott offset each perfectly (Dougray, I forgive you for abandoning X-men) and have some wonderful exchanges.  My only complaint is that the ending seemed a bit rushed.  The climax seems to just keep building and building and then the credits roll.  Oh well.Overall, \"Mission: Impossible 2\" provides a great time for all (all guys, at least) and is stuffed so many amazing moments, you\\'ll wish the big screen had a rewind button. (8/10)\"', '\"(contains minor spoilers)In spite of a half litre of Hagen Daz and a slush puppy, my brain wasn\\'t nearly numb enough mush to do more than float off and consider the meaning of life while Affleck whittered on through this movie.It could have been great. Cataclysms, the horrific paycheck that can go with politically disingenuous power blocks, questions about the balance of power and how we can achieve greater global stability in a world that is still not free of nuclear arms. But no, none of this - but it least it lasts long enough to justify a megaton of popcorn.Even using more of the original novel (which had Israeli extremists rather than Neo-Nazis) might have yielded some intellectual component. Some decent characterization and casting might have helped too. But it was entertaining enough, overlooking these flaws, until it totally ran out of steam . . .\\n\\'Ben Affleck saves the world\\' is as about as convincing as \\'Hugh Grant plays Othello\\'. So is the squeaky clean CIA and all-American plot (squeaky clean enough to draw assistance from the CIA and American military of course - check out the credits). Johnny Depp or even (remembering Three Kings) George Clooney might have injected some moral integrity into the roles, but there again - they tend to be fussier about the films they work in.A plot involving terrorists that have real issues with American foreign policy might have been intellectually engaging - whereas the actual villains are more akin to the \\'Dr Evil\\' of Austin Powers movies   in their one-dimensional \\'evil-ness\\' - a suitable match perhaps against the toy-boy appeal of Affleck - though why, on earth, did Morgan Freeman bother??The plot itself has as much sophistication as a boys comic story. The latest \\'Star Wars\\' comes to mind. And Bridget Moynahan (Coyote Ugly) as a doctor? She reminded me Cameron Diaz\\'s \\'doctor\\' character in \\'Something about Mary\\' - aren\\'t doctors supposed to be able to occasionally exhibit more intelligence than token eye candy characters??\"', '\"This was my favorite movie this summer by far!  It had everything I wanted in a movie (guns, explosions, chases, and an awesome fight scene).  This is a must-see action-thriller, if you miss this movie in theaters, well you missed out on one heck of a good blockbuster!\"', '\"of the new Shaft. This movie is definitely fresh and fun, with fabulous acting. Jeffrey Wright was a revelation. I\\'ve been a big fan of Sam Jackson since Jungle Fever and I\\'ll see anything he\\'s in. He\\'s definitely the man for this character. However, his John Shaft is somewhat too reactive and jumpy, and because of this, some of his successes and escapes seem unrealistic. On the other hand, he\\'s very human. And this could make for some interesting sequels, especially if his Shaft is allowed to develop more of the smoothness of Richard Roundtree\\'s. Jackson is still an amazing presence on the screen whatever he does. The music sounds as wonderful as ever. The plot is gripping if you\\'re a justice freak like me, because you really want to see the genuinely evil villain played by Christian Bale get what\\'s coming to him. I don\\'t want to spoil it by saying whether he does or doesn\\'t, but I will say that what happened wasn\\'t what I expected, and I\\'m not sure I preferred it this way. This, plus a few plot holes and unrealistic escapes prevented me from totally loving the movie, but I did enjoy it a lot, and I\\'ll see it again on video to catch what I missed. There is a lot of intelligence in it, and I attribute much of that to Richard Price\\'s script (he also wrote the excellent Clockers). Still, I find myself hoping there will be a sequel I can give a whole-hearted 10 to.\"', '\"As a long time fan of the original Bad Boys, I\\'ve been waiting for this sequel for 8 years. It met every one of my expectations and blew some of them completely out of the water.The action scenes were amazing, except for some strange camera work that made the chase scenes a bit hard to follow. The way Marcus and Mike interact with each other is what makes the film great in my view. They have a great chemistry, the way that they deal/fight with each other is what makes them the funniest cop duo ever.The final scene where the two of them are sitting on the double raft as the pool breaks was one of the best scenes in the movie for me, because it shows their perfect chemistry together.I anxiously await the third Bad Boys.\"', '\"Why?

He clearly had a lot of fun during the filming of this movie.  Also, Halle Berry is beautiful as Jinx.  But the thing that amazed me the most, was the role of Toby Stephens, the villain Gustav Graves.  He is the youngest man ever to play the villain in a bond movie and he does that very well, way better than the weak performance of Robert Carlyle in \"the world...\"  The ice palace is a fantastic creation, one of the most beautiful in the history of James Bond.  And, finally, Bond drives an aston martin.  The way it should be... So, \"die another day\" is a good Bondmovie, with loads of action, sex, adventure and, of course, beautiful women.\"', '\"The Fast and the Furious is, at the very least, an intriguing franchise, for it gives gearheads the kind of inspiration and fantasy they need to have to keep sane. I\\'ve always found car hobbyists to face quite the paradox; the problem with cars is that they are grossly expensive, so if you\\'re a middle class man, having two is quite the luxury. However, if you\\'re deep into cars as a fascination, you presumably not only want one or two cars, you want several, and you want them customized and rigged to your liking. Customizing and optimizing the performance on one car is grossly expensive, but having a garage of half a dozen or more customized/optimized vehicles could cost as much as your house and your neighbor\\'s houses put together. This is why, each and every day, I\\'m more and more satisfied with my lack of interest in cars and my own obsession with the Honda Accord I drive.The Fast and the Furious also gives gearheads that kind of adrenaline rush and visualization of their dreams realized because they, themselves, often don\\'t have the means, the vehicles, nor the kind of closed-range courses to carry out the kind of eye-popping stunts and mayhem the characters in these films cause. It caters to that level of unbridled excitement, when you\\'re actually racing in a vehicle and that moment where you get that indescribable pang in your chest reminding you know that you\\'re alive. I was fully ready to embrace this franchise for its fantastical elements, but unsure if I could still be entertained watching car chases and death-defying stunts for an upwards of two hours.What\\'s pleasant about The Fast and the Furious is that it focuses on the relationships the characters have with one another in the midst of all the racing. The film\\'s slender plot revolves around Brian O\\'Connors (Paul Walker), an undercover Los Angeles police officer sent to infiltrate a ring of truck hijackers and street racers in the heart of L.A.. Led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a suave know-it-all when it comes to vehicles, the gang is known for their heavily armed carjacking activities of large eighteen wheelers, in addition to their work at auto-body shops where they modify and customize cars, some of which flirting with and others unabashedly breaking the laws of what is street legal. Also working in Dom\\'s crew are Leticia Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), his longtime girlfriend and mechanic at his shop, in addition to his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), whom becomes the apple of Brian\\'s eye late in the film.Brian\\'s infiltration of Dom\\'s ring soon becomes corrupted by his fascination with the culture Dom and his crew have created; it\\'s a culture that specializes in prompting and maintaining a longterm adrenaline rush in the most unique and heart-pounding ways. Despite Brian\\'s responsibility to uphold the law through all this, he finds his involvement with Dom going above and beyond the call of the law, as far as hooking up with Dom\\'s sister and helping Dom plot a crackdown of former partners that have turned into rival gangmembers following a reneged agreement.No matter which way you slice it, The Fast and the Furious is slight in substance, but often very strong on a level of entertainment. At only one-hundred minutes, it pleasantly skates by without being too much of an assault on the senses and operates largely on the charm and infectious personalities of its actors. Walker is the standout of the crowd, maintaining a certain level of cool and street-smarts and his character never hitting the level of cocksure confidence, making him a more watchable and likable presence. That\\'s not to undermine Diesel\\'s role here, because without him, this film wouldn\\'t be as much of a bromance as it already is. From the first race, it is clear that Walker and Diesel have enough chemistry to create a bond between two opposite characters in terms of life paths in order to go on many more adventures with one another. The supporting cast of Rodriguez and Brewster are fine, though even in more masculine roles, the two feel like nothing more than decorative pieces of eye-candy that help further the plot along when convenient.But perhaps such was just destined to be the case in The Fast and the Furious, a film where escapist tendencies take over and nothing else matters besides the moment when your car begins to redline or a part becomes misplaced in Dom\\'s garage of odds and ends. Being that this film largely predicates itself on male bonding and the thrill of racing from both an illegal and adrenaline-charged angle, The Fast and the Furious largely possesses a homey quality that makes it believable and grounded in reality, despite a certain conclusion with a certain train that, I confess, was still entertaining in the realm of cinematic incredulity. This is a fun and effective film in being every gearhead\\'s fantasy and being a damn fine piece of entertainment.Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster. Directed by: Rob Cohen.\"', '\"Charlie\\'s Angels is one of the few movies next to the MI series that is a good adaption of the tv show on which it is based.

But O Connor is lured into the fast cars and Dom\\'s sister played by Jordana Brewster! But as he and Dom form a reluctant than easy friendship over time. O Connor must choose and is conflicted at the same time between his duties as a cop and one that of a friend.Really the movie shocked even the stars and that they are still at this twelve years later with a sixth movie coming out in the summertime!\"', '\"This movie is relatively entertaining and provokes a few good laughs. It exhibits the classic structure of the Fairytale for Underdogs, leading the viewer to root along with the losers (Ocean\\'s 11) against the powerful and rich (Andy Garcia\\'s character). We are to hope that this mad-capped caper will succeed so that the eleven losers will no longer be insolvent, and the rich guy will lose big.The odd thing about this version of the fairytale is that we have no idea why we should detest the King of Three Casinos. Is it because he\\'s a crook (which we don\\'t really know)? Apparently not, since the losers who are taking him on are also crooks. Is it because he stole the ex-con Ocean\\'s wife (played insipidly, as usual, by Julia Roberts)? That seems to be the idea, but we haven\\'t a clue as to why SHE divorced him (and not vice versa), except for the fact that he was in prison for a number of years, and she is clearly angry with him about something. Perhaps, having been left in the lurch, she simply decided to move on... But now we are supposed to side with the loser ex-con upon his release from prison as he endeavors to rob $160 million from her new boyfriend, while winning her back as well.There seems to be a bit of a socialist undercurrent here, for even if the Andy Garcia character is a crook, he\\'s a successful crook, unlike his adversaries. So it looks as though we are supposed to hate him for being competent and rich! Julia Roberts plays a woman who appears to have been hurt deeply by her ex-husband the ex-con, but is ready to hit the road with him again, upon his successful heist of $160 million from the guy who has provided her with not only companionship during her ex-husband\\'s incarceration, but also a job as the curator of a museum in one of his casinos. (Hmmm... Was it love that attracted her to him?) Honestly, I don\\'t get. At the end of the day, this morally sanctimonious chick appears to click with whoever is rich!The socialist waters become even more muddled at this point, for now that Ocean\\'s eleven are rich, shouldn\\'t we side with some other cluster of underdogs who should now want to rob them? (It looks as though I\\'ll have to watch the sequels for the answer to that question!) In fact, if we (the moviegoers) were to take the premise of this film seriously, we should all conspire to rob George, Brad, Matt, Julia, et al., of the millions that they each earned for starring in this thing!!!OCEAN\\'S ELEVEN was never meant to provoke thought. Just some raucous laughter and the primordial desire to side against anyone who\\'s better off than one\\'s self. Or maybe just the idea that a bunch of losers might be able to pull off an impossible heist despite the fact that they make blunder after blunder, almost blowing it about a dozen times. So, against all odds, fortuna takes their side. Maybe that was it.\"', '\"How in the heck can the audience expect to believe that anyone, man or woman, could possibly garner the hang time these girls get on their kicks and jumps.  Michael Jordan in his heyday should have been so fortunate! At least in the Matrix, the charachters had an explanation for how they could hang in the air.  To me, this makes the movie a ridiculous joke.  I\\'m not anal, I know there are certain things we as an audience are supposed to overlook as being impossible but this was just  too much!  It looked totally stupid!  That goes for Jet Li and his antics in Romeo Must Die also. There has been way too much computer trickery and editing in fight scenes nowadays and I am not the only one who thinks this.  A lot of people are sick of these \"fake\" and unrealistic fight scenes.  Also, if I see one more movie where there\\'s an explosion and an actor or actors are walking away from it with their backs turned and they don\\'t even flinch, I am going to be sick. It has been played before and it sucked then!!!!!!!  (Desperado, Vampires, etc.)\"', '\"This is the first Brosnan as Bond film I\\'ve seen. He is probably the best Bond since Roger Moore. The opening sequence is terrific. All the special effects are very good. Halle Berry as Jinx, the capable NSA(?) agent, and John Cleese as Q, are excellent. Judy Dench is not right as M, and I didn\\'t care for Smantha Bond as Moneypenny.It\\'s a typical Bond plot with the usual bad puns and double entendres. The plot takes Bond from North Korea, to Hong Kong, to Cuba, to London, to Iceland. This time the evil genius is a nefarious North Korean colonel.Four things I did not like. First, it was very dark. We actually see Bond being tortured. Also, we see blood. I can\\'t recall another Bond film with blood being shown. Usually there is a suggestion of blood and torture off screen. Second, the theme song by Madonna. It was just awful. More like screeching than singing. Third, with all the references to previous Bond films, I think the producers, writers, etc. are taking themselves way too seriously. Fourth, it was about 10 minutes too long.I thought the episodes in Hong Kong and Cuba were the film\\'s best. Also, the sword fight was very enjoyable.In the pantheon of Bond films I\\'d rate it about average. Not as good as \"From Russia With Love\" or \"Goldfinger\" better than \"Octopussy\" or \"On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service.\" It is worth seeing.\"', '\"Contains mild spoilers.Well, a week ago I finally saw Men in Black II (MIB2).  Having read lots of negative user comments and critical reviews, I feared when I finally went to see it on the big screen that I would be appalled by what I saw, that it would be the worst sequel since Speed 2 or Batman & Robin (Not that I went to see either of THOSE movies.  I pity the trusting souls that DID go to see them.)  Well, I saw it, and I almost liked it: No, of course it wasn\\'t as good as the first MIB.  But how many of us really expected the sequel to be as good?  On its own terms, this movie is a fine summer entertainment, with enough laughs, thrills and special effects to rate as acceptable escapism; if it were not a sequel to a superior movie, I doubt that anybody would be attacking it so harshly.  I was satisfied that the filmmakers kept this movie short and sweet, innocuous enough for kids but not so childish that adults can\\'t enjoy it as well.Whatever plot this movie cares to have is established (sort of) in its priceless opening sequence, which spoofs UFO-speculation series of the \\'70s and \\'80s, and is hosted by Peter Graves (of course!)  During the opening credits we see a spaceship obliterating planets, and we know that EARTH IS IN DANGER.  We all know how the movie will proceed storywise, more or less, from this point forward; in a movie like this the plot is incidental.  What mattered in the first MIB were the interesting characters, their lively dialogue, the surprises both funny and scary, and most of all the movie\\'s style: the quirky, subdued manner in which the story was told.  MIB2 possesses these qualities as well, but unfortunately it has slightly less to offer in every category than the first movie did (it is, after all, a shorter, smaller movie), and many people have not been able to forgive this shortcoming.If everything in MIB2 was as funny and inspired as the opening sequence with Peter Graves, it would have been a great sequel indeed.  But several of its notable gags misfire or fall flat: I can remember four or five separate instances in the movie in which director Barry Sonnenfeld failed to make the jokes at least as funny as they must have looked on paper.  At one point, for example, agents Jay and Kay make a quick escape from MIB headquarters by being \"flushed,\" as the room they occupy turns into a giant toilet; this absurd but undeniably funny idea should have been foolproof, but somehow it falls flat, perhaps because it\\'s over almost as soon as it begins: the movie doesn\\'t give us a chance to laugh at what\\'s happening, and (even worse) gives us a punchline that\\'s not very funny (or perhaps only poorly delivered).  In another scene, MIB chief Zed (Rip Torn) attempts to fight off Seerleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) by hovering in mid-air, Matrix-style, and kicking her in the face several times.  This moment was obviously intended to parody The Matrix, but it\\'s not especially funny because it\\'s not very inventive: Sonnenfeld and the writers apparently thought the mere sight of the elderly Rip Torn performing Matrix-style acrobatics would be enough to make the audience laugh, with no elaboration or explanation necessary. Many potentially funny moments in this movie are ruined by conceit and sheer laziness in the writing: Johnny Knoxville\\'s alien character is given two heads, but no memorably funny lines; the writers apparently thought the mere sight of a two-headed Johnny Knoxville would be enough to make the audience laugh.  How hard is it to write jokes about a two-headed alien?Although MIB2 can\\'t match the laughs of the first movie, I still enjoyed it, and I recommend it, for two simple reasons: Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. They are great fun to watch together, and Sonnenfeld, to his credit, gets some hysterically funny moments out of them both.  You\\'ll laugh to see Smith wrestling with computer-generated monsters of all sizes: I dare say he earned his money for this movie, which required of him enough pratfalls to fill a Jerry Lewis movie.  You\\'ll laugh to see Jones maintain his deadpan expression no matter how silly the action around him: even while hanging upside-down in an elevator, trading shots with a robot that\\'s spewing machine-gun bullets (that\\'s right, machine-gun bullets) at him, he responds with calm courage and cool sarcasm.  He\\'s a great guy to plunge so eagerly into such silliness, especially since he\\'s old enough to know better: he has more lines on his face than Jack Palance, yet here he is shooting two little shiny laser guns while hanging upside-down.  Smith and Jones: together they recapture the first movie\\'s larger-than-life sense of fun, and give this sequel its most entertaining moments.Please go see this movie, if you feel the need for big-screen entertainment in the next week or two; yes, it has some bad gags in it, but that flaw doesn\\'t make it terrible, or unworthy of the first movie.  Except for the bad gags, I would have given this movie a solid 7 out of 10; except for one or two inappropriate moments that hint at black comedy, this is a warm, lighthearted movie that amused me even during its bad moments, and left me feeling good by the time the credits rolled and Smith started singing \"black suits coming.\"  I prefer a flawed film that leaves me feeling good to a critically acclaimed film that would probably leave me feeling bad if I saw it.  All the evidence suggests that The Road to Perdition is a good movie which does not life the spirits of its audience; the self-serious people who hate MIB2 should go see it.  I\\'d rather see MIB2 again, which sadly seems destined to be one of the last enjoyable movies of the summer.Rating: 6\"', '\"(**contains possible spoilers**)East meets West for laughs and plenty of action in director Tom Dey\\'s `Shanghai Noon,\\' starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson.  In 1881 China, Royal Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is smuggled out of the Forbidden City and taken to Carson City, Nevada, where she is held for a one hundred thousand dollar ransom in gold.  The Emperor promptly dispatches his top three Imperial Guards, an interpreter (Henry O), and the interpreter\\'s nephew, Chon Wang (Chan), to deliver the gold and bring the Princess safely back to China.  During a botched train robbery in Nevada, the interpreter is killed, and Chon Wang sets out to find the man responsible; but first he must discharge his duty to the Emperor, by finding Carson City and the Princess.  Along the way he meets up with a left-handed gunslinger named Roy O\\'Bannon (Wilson), who was the leader of the gang that tried to rob the train.  The cowboy who killed his uncle, a man named Wallace (Walt Goggins), Wang learns, was a new guy to the gang; Roy didn\\'t know him, and nobody, of course, was to supposed to get hurt.  Once that issue is resolved, it\\'s shades of Butch and Sundance as Wang and Roy team up to rescue the Princess (and the gold). \\tDey alternates the action and laughs, often combining the two, and keeps it all moving along at a good, even pace.  The likable Chan puts plenty of spirit into Wang, and the fight scenes are spectacular; well choreographed and orchestrated.  He also proves himself adept on the comedy front, at times infusing a bit of Stan Laurel in his expression.  The charismatic Wilson also shines as Roy, with a subtle, straight-forward delivery that is right on the mark.  There\\'s a chemistry between the two that works splendidly, and their timing is perfect.  And they play it with a contemporary attitude that fuels the off-beat ambience; at times, it\\'s like a Newman and Redford in the Twilight Zone.  Liu, as well, gives a notable performance, lending a Royal mien to her Princess Pei Pei.  There\\'s a number of memorable scenes here, including one in which Wang encounters the Sioux (and we can only guess what\\'s really in that peace-pipe); and another, early in the film, that finds Roy buried up to his neck and left to die in the desert, only to be found by Wang, who puts two chopsticks in Roy\\'s mouth and tells him to start digging.  The comedy plays well throughout the film, managing real laughs without resorting to slapstick or sight gags.  Also worthy of mention is that the opening scene was filmed in China, in the Forbidden City. \\tThe excellent supporting cast includes Jason Connery (Andrews), Brandon Merrill (Indian wife), Roger Yuan (Lo Fong), Xander Berkeley (Van Cleef) and Russell Badger (Sioux Chief).  `Shanghai Noon\\' is, above all, a fun movie; a light-hearted and often hilarious spin on the old west, forever changed (historically and cinematically), now that Wang and O\\'Bannon have happened onto the scene.  This is one pair of cowboys you\\'re going to remember, and this is one funny movie you\\'re going to want to see more than once.  And that\\'s a promise, Pardner.  I rate this one 8/10.\"', '\"This is the best evidence of the death of the James Bond movies. D.A.D is nothing more than a over-hyped showoff of stupid effects, hopeless dialogue and a story without substance whatsoever. Over the last years, the Bond team have tried to make increasingly \"modern\" movies, using more and more advanced effects etc, in order to match 007 with today\\'s world society. Certainly not a bad idea itself. Unfortunately, Brosnan\\'s Bond has, with the exception of Goldeneye, suffered dramatically. Compared to the earlier movies, James Bond is now nothing but action, computer-generated effects, and more action, combined with silly dialogue lacking the style and charisma we\\'re used to from earlier (in particular Sean Connery). Barbara Broccoli and co. seems to be in desperate need of a good story, as D.A.D is nothing more than a fancy bowl with nothing in it. The Bond saga has turned into a money-making monster designed to please as many action-lovers as possible. Unfortunately, this is what the films do, and therefore, I\\'m afraid, the future Bonds will be of the same caliber as this one; an awful money-making action film with the potential to annoy, not to entertain. Please, let someone finish him off, or even turn back time. The future will kill 007, let him instead ressurect in the 60\\'s. Now that is a good idea.\"', '\"Though not quite as bad as Pearl Harbor this is very close. and that is saying something. This truly horrendous. Only Morgan Freeman manages to give a remotley good performence. He is a great actor but he could play this character in his sleep. Cheesy, Sentimental, boring crud. * out of five\"', '\"You may be able to outrace the cops, Vin Diesel, but you can\\'t outrace Krampus.\"', '\"Die Another DayThis is my first time rewatching it, since I bought the dvd in 2003.Despite hating the cgi surfing at the beginning and the awful green screen fight on the hovercraft thing, I\\'m actually a really big fan of the pre title sequence and opening credits, though, I\\'m seriously not a fan of Madonna\\'s title track though. It\\'s just awful. Not as bad as the Garbage one, but still horrible. I don\\'t even hate the invisible car!! Did that car chase on the ice influence one of the awful F&F movies?I really enjoy the opening twenty minutes - half an hour. But after the awesome fight at the fencing club and the arrival in Iceland, the movies seems to lose its way and all the character building/development and good dialogue is out of the window as the movie goes from one action set piece to another. It\\'s too cgi/green screen heavy and I hate the fight amongst the lasers. Too ridiculous for too long (Though it was pretty cool how jinx saved Bond) and the less said about Bond surfing a tsunami the better.Judi Dench isn\\'t given much to do this time around which is a shame, Michael Madsen is wasted in a small role, he is just sort of there and Rosamond Pike is good, though I\\'m not sure why she was in just a bra for the final fight lol Bond girls gotta Bond girl I suppose.As for Halle Berry (this was her first movie after her Oscar win) she looks great and is really good in her action scenes, but like Denise Richards her delivery isn\\'t the best. Admittedly she is hampered by some god awful dialogue. Thinking about it, I don\\'t think Bond Girls should be played by someone as famous as Halle Berry or Denise RichardsI didn\\'t check the run time, but this flew by. It seemed to be the shortest of Brosnan\\'s Bond moviesRandom though, Bond does love to pinch a grape in hospitals lolDie Another Day grossed $160 million at the domestic box office, to become the highest grossing movie in the franchise at the time. Every Brosnan Bond movie crosses the $100 million barrier domestically.\"', '\"There are always those movies that you see that when looked at from a serious perspective, seem like the corniest movies ever. However it was pretty obvious that the intention of this film was to be corny and viewed from a more laid-back perspective. take the movie for what it is: funny and a little cheesy\"', '\"\"Charlie\\'s Angels\" is not a masterpiece, but it is one hell of a good time. For it\\'s entire 98 minute running time I was entertained, there is always something going on. Whether it\\'s one of the many martial arts sequences, or a car chase, or provactaavly sexy shot\\'s of the Angels, this film is always entertaining. It\\'s makes for a good nights  worth of entertainment.\"', '\"While Ocean\\'s 11 might be the best film of the year (that belongs to memento). It certinly is the coolest. From the opening shot to when the gang goes there sperate ways this movie made me forget everything that was going on in the world and for a brief time i just sat and watched one of the greatest ensamble casts have fun. You could tell everyone in this movie had fun and it shows.\"', '\"For the most part Die Another Day was an enjoyable movie, but there were a few very annoying parts.To the good:  I loved seeing some of the old gadgets and tools of the trade that were featured in previous movies.  I spotted four or five without trying (like the knife shoe and the jetpack).  I also have to say that Pierce Brosnan is doing a great job as Bond.  The supporting cast for the most part is also very good, Judi Dench and John Cleese fill their roles particularly well.  There were also some thoroughly entertaining action scenes, especially the sword fight.  The car chase was pretty exciting as well.  Although I wish the bad guy\\'s gadgets had gotten more of a chance at working.To the bad:  I thought the double entendre in the dialogue was much more blatant than in previous Bonds (this is especially true in the final scene). Or perhaps it is just that the delivery was terrible.  Actually overall I thought the movie was much more risque than it needed to be.  Just because Halle Berry wanted to have the first sex scene in a Bond movie, doesn\\'t mean it belongs there.  Speaking of Halle Berry...  I didn\\'t like her in this movie.  It was too obvious that she was ecstatic to be in a Bond movie (overplaying the entendres, hamming up the sultry looks).  I also felt Michael Madsen was not the best choice for M\\'s American counterpart.  If the movie was trying to be so nostalgic, why not bring back one of the old Felix Lighter actors to play the part? Then there is the car.  Was it really necessary to make it invisible?  No. Especially because the science doesn\\'t support it.  Sure the science doesn\\'t support a lot of Bond gadgets, but this was more blatant and annoying than most.I think the Bond purists will like this movie, but will find a number of things to be annoyed about.  Adrenaline movie junkies will probably just really enjoy the movie.\"', '\"This movie was a total disappointment for me. In the first 15-20 minutes it was not so badly done, but after that the story simply lost all dramatic suspense and conviction in a miserably failed attempt to turn an action film into some sort of \"artistic\" dance with overly-emphasized use of slow motion sequences. I have never in my life watched an action film with so many karate chops and gunshots and explosions, and so little suspense, so little thrill. Some of the characters, especially the key villain, were unconvincing and sort of not fully formed (the writers could take a few cues from the Bond movies), and director Woo seemed to think so highly of some of his \"inventions\" that he felt the need to repeat them over and over again (more than he should have to achieve the desired effect, e.g. the waves during the fight sequence at the end). The music was overdone and badly placed at times, too. By the end, the story (along with the suspense and drama) seemed to have lost all importance - it was like watching a really long music video with scenes from an action flick in it.\"', '\"I loved \"Clear and Present Danger\", \"Patriot Games\" and \"Hunt for Red October\", so I figured I\\'d like this one.  Oh, how wrong could I be!You would have thought they would have spent a little money on LIGHTING!! So many parts of the movie are so dark, you can\\'t tell what\\'s going on!And the plot, if that\\'s what you can call it.  Way too jumbled to make any sense.The Feds should start requiring movies to open with the lead actor/actress looking into the camera and tell us if we are about to waste 3 hours of our life watching crap!There are many worse movies out there, but this movie is one to miss.I give it .13 stars out of 4!\"', '\"I\\'ve been a huge fan of 007 for as long as I can remember (I saw some pre-release clips from Live And Let Die on TV when I was eight) and I haven\\'t missed a Bond in the cinema since The Spy Who Loved Me. I read all Fleming\\'s books in my teens and I don\\'t know how many times I\\'ve seen all the films. Although there have been some real lows along the way, I\\'ve never actually left the cinema with a complete sense of emptiness until I just walked out after seeing Die Another Day. It was bitsy, it lacked flair, the baddies were flat and un-engaging, the plot... what plot? The invisible Vanquish... what was that all about? And some kind of holo deck? The DNA replacement therapy that turned Asians to Caucasians... absolute rubbish. I\\'m amazed that when I write this, Die Another Day has achieved almost 7 on the IMDb rating. How is that possible? This is not just some action flick where the audience can be bought with special effects and loud noise (neither of which were particularly impressive, just to add insult to injury). Bond has a heritage and one worth protecting. I\\'m very disappointed.\"', '\"John Singleton is an excellent director. Samuel L. Jackson is a great actor.When I heard they were doing Shaft, I thought \"great, must see that.\".The end result,however, is a routine but well-made thriller and \\'Shaft\\' is merely used as a brand name. The plot is simply daft but no worse than any of the Lethal Weapon movies and there are enough thrills n\\' spills to entertain.This movie plays better on video/DVD than on the big screen. also it is great to hear the updated version of Isaac Hayes\\' theme.Surely one of THE all time great movie themes.\"', '\"Slick? Yes. Lots of action? Yes. Tom Cruise? Yes. Good enough? Maybe.When I came out of the theater, I had decided to give the movie an 8 (7.8 actually), but by the time I got home I had decided to give it a 7.MI-2 is kind of fun to watch. Like I say, it is well crafted and some excellent special effects and really outstanding stunts. But, it has problems too.At over 2 hours, they should have cut 20 minutes of action and added 10 minutes of relationship building between Cruise and his new girlfriend - whatever her name is. As it was, the action got boring by the end. Also, the notion that Cruise would instantly fall madly in love with this girl is ridiculous!  I didn\\'t buy it.Still, it had a few interesting details that I don\\'t recall seeing. And, the first half hour was very good. So, all in all, I would recommend it. Just leave your brain at home!\"', '\"After directing heavy dramas like TRAFFIC (which won him an Oscar) and ERIN BROCKOVICH, Steven Soderbergh decided to lighten up a little with this delightful remake of the 1960 rat pack classic. George Clooney steps into Frank Sinatra\\'s shoes as Danny Ocean, the ex-con who gets together with a large crew of cronies to rob three Las Vegas Casinos owned by a Las Vegas bigwig (Andy Garcia) who is now dating Danny\\'s ex-wife (Julia Roberts). The screenplay is a little on the complex side and sometimes it\\'s a little hard to keep track of what Danny and his crew are doing, but the film is so great to look at and the cast appears to be having so much fun, you really just let little plotting devices slide and just go with it. Clooney has never appeared so smooth and slick on screen and is backed by a great cast including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Elliott Gould, and in a casting stroke of genius as a veteran con man, comic legend Carl Reiner. A slick and stylish crime caper that looks great and is wonderful mindless fun for a Saturday night movie rental.\"', '\"This film was, IMO, far superior to the original Mission Impossible.  It more accurately captured the feel of the original series and had a fresher directorial style, which seems to have brought more out of the cast than the original movie.

I\\'m all for action movies and blowing c**p up, beating the c**p out of someone, etc, but this was too much.  This movie\\'s convoluted and utterly unbelievable plot had some drug kingpin\\'s cover operation in a funeral home.

Michelle Rodriguez is on hand as Dom\\'s babe while Matt Schulze plays an angry member of his gang.\"The Fast and the Furious\" (2001) was the beginning of the popular street-racing franchise that currently has eight movies with two more planned. The over-the-top action is akin to \"The Road Warrior\" (1981) while the tone mixes the comic book melodrama of \"The Warriors\" (1979) and \"Torque\" (2004) with the more serious air of \"Grand Canyon\" (1991) and \"Training Day\" (2001). (Yes, I realize \"Torque\" and \"Training Day\" debuted after this one; I\\'m just providing comparative references).Speaking of the tone, there\\'s no goofiness and the actors take everything dead seriously, which is good in my book, but the flick has several unintentional laughs because, while quasi-realistic, the thrills & posing are so exaggerated.Brewster and Rodriguez are effective in the feminine department, but neither do much for me personally. There are a few good-looking ladies in the periphery, however.The soundtrack contains several dynamic urban numbers, including the excellent \"Deep Enough\" by Live.The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & nearby areas (San Bernardino, Hemet, Malibu, Westminster, Beverly Hills, etc.).GRADE: B\"', '\"I\\'ve only walked out of two movies in my entire life after paying $7 for the ticket and who-knows-how-much on the concessions:  the first was Johnny Mnemonic.

There\\'s all you want when you watch a film of this genre: motor bikes, explosions, fights and an atmosphere of danger in the air. The central plot is quite fictitious, but it\\'s good! I felt it lost something important when compared to the first movie, the art itself. De Palma\\'s direction, besides the wonderful scenes of action, added some mystery and beauty to the story, something John Woo couldn\\'t do. It\\'s something too subjective to be described in a few lines, but watching this second movie makes we realise De Palma and Woo have different points of view. This is positive, because we can compare them and make our conclusions. \"Mission: Impossible II\", although without De Palma\\'s style, is really good. The story is carefully built and it proves John Woo is one of the best action film directors we have nowadays.

The film makers even admit to the fact that it is a non-turbo, yet still proceed to tell you it IS turbocharged and even dubbed in blow-off valve noises when it shifts.  But again, its a MOVIE.  We have actors pretending to be things they are not, so what is the difference if they pretend the car is something its not.Paul Walker\\'s acting.  From time to time in the movie, he really nails a line and conveys incredible amounts of emotion.  (Like the scene where he and Dom are eating lunch alone together)  But other times his delivery is just plain flat.  (Like where he offers up his pink slip to race)  If you just focus on the acting of Vin Diesel (which was just awesome) you should be able to overlook Paul Walker\\'s short comings.They had to bring something illegal into it.  Well, apart from the fact that street racing is illegal in the first place, that is.  I am sure there is someone, somewhere, who street races and IS in fact a criminal.  But the way it is portrayed in this movie is just ridiculous.  But again, this is Hollywood we are talking about.  If there was nothing like that going on, there would be no plot.  Just be happy its not drugs.Nitrous Oxide was over used.  Especially on turbocharged cars.  Anyone who has ever tuned a turbocharged car knows that it is no small task. Maintaining a safe air-fuel ratio while maximizing power is tough.  Adding nitrous-oxide into the mix (which requires additional fuel to go with it) is damned near impossible.  Only the top of the line professional racers pull it off as a large power adder and do it safely.  The fact that almost every car in this movie has both a turbocharger AND nitrous is just ridiculous. HOWEVER.. with that being said, it definitely adds something to the suspense of the race scenes.  It gives the director the ability to make someone appear to be losing a race, and let them hit their NOS button at the last minute to start a come back and make it close.  So although it is a bit unrealistic that so many people would run nitrous oxide, it adds entertainment value to the film.So thats it!  The movie was extremely well done.  The editing is great, and there are some parts that really keep you on the edge of your seat.  It is by no means predictable, either.  There are many parts of the movie that could really go either way, and the director does a great job of keeping you in the dark until the scene ends.  The interaction between Brian, Mia, and Vince was great too.  You could feel the love Vince has for Dominic and his crew, and that he really feels he is protecting them from Brian.The characters are believable, and you really find yourself caring for them and what happens to them.  The action is great AND believable (if you can overlook a few minor things).GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  In fact, I am about to go see it again right now.\"', '\"Released in 2000, \"Shanghai Noon\" features Jackie Chan as Chon Wang (the Chinese spelling of John Wayne, lol) who teams up with good-bad-guy Roy O\\'Bannon (Owen Wilson). They\\'re pursuing the Empress of China or a load of gold -- whatever -- and have many misadventures.It didn\\'t dawn on me until the end that the title \"Shanghai Noon\" is a comical take on \"High Noon\" (aduh). Anyway, this is a good flick to watch if you\\'re in the mood for an Indiana Jones-type movie, like 1999\\'s \"The Mummy.\" It\\'s not as good as \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", but it\\'s better than its sequels.Chan and Wilson have great chemistry and the humor is really funny, like the Wyatt Earp line at the end. Of course, with Jackie Chan the action is great as well, but it goes a bit overboard towards the end, which is typical of Hollywood.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada, and the Forbidden City, Beijing.GRADE: B+\"']\n"

      "['\"This film is hilarious. Don\\'t believe the nay-sayers--go see for yourself. The plot may not be the most original, but the execution is flawless, the timing for the slapstick impeccable. With good support from Michael Caine, Candice Bergen and William Shatner, Sandra Bullock carries off a virtuoso performance as a tomboy FBI agent who goes undercover in a beauty pageant to investigate a terrorist threat. Light fare, but good fun.\"', '\"This movie was a great, very silly comedy to watch with friends. We all enjoyed it and like to crack each other up with its hilarious one liners! It\\'s basically the story of the fading career of a once super-hot model, Derek Zoolander. He is being knocked out of the modeling business by new, boyish Hansel (Owen Wilson). Derek is brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia. The story in between is the good part, however. Full of wittier humor than the very blunt lines of Dodgeball. Still stupid-funny enough for the shallowest of us to understand. I would definitely recommend this movie to teens and adults who want something that is easy to watch yet keeps you absorbed, and something that will take your mind off your own life for a while. Its humor will brighten your day a bit.\"', '\"I was in my early teens when this was released ten years ago, and I never heard of it at the time. In early 2006, I went to the theatre while this movie\\'s sequel, \"Big Momma\\'s House 2\", was playing, but since I had never seen the original by this point and could see that the sequel was widely hated, it was obviously not the movie I was going to see. Instead, I went to see \"The Matador\" on that particular trip to the movie theatre. It took me over four years after that to get around to watching the original \"Big Momma\\'s House\", and just before seeing it, I had low expectations, thinking it would probably be a very unfunny comedy, even if it wasn\\'t absolutely terrible. However, while it\\'s unsurprisingly not that great, I did laugh.Malcolm Turner is an FBI agent who is very skilled in disguising himself for undercover operations. After it is announced that a murderer and robber named Lester Vesco has just escaped from prison, where he was serving his life sentence, Malcolm and fellow FBI agent John Maxwell are sent to catch him. The FBI believes that the criminal\\'s ex-girlfriend, Sherry Pierce, was also involved in criminal activity, but they haven\\'t been able to prove it. Malcolm and John go to the neighbourhood in Georgia where Sherry\\'s morbidly obese grandmother, Hattie Mae Pierce (a.k.a. Big Momma) lives, and begin to spy on her. Sherry is on her way to her grandmother\\'s house with her son, Trent, but before they arrive, Big Momma leaves town unexpectedly, so Malcolm decides to pose as the feisty elderly woman! He takes on her lifestyle while trying to get the truth from Sherry, and also finds himself falling for the criminal\\'s ex-girlfriend! Before it is announced that Lester has escaped from prison and Malcolm and John go to spy on Big Momma\\'s house, the film begins with the two FBI agents busting a dog fight, and I guess parts of this sequence are somewhat funny, but no more than that. The film continues to be mostly straight-faced after this, as we learn about the escaped prisoner, the two agents are sent on their mission, and Malcolm disguises himself as Big Momma. The early part where Malcolm has to hide in the shower while Big Momma defecates is memorable, but not in a good way. For a while, it didn\\'t seem like I would be able to give \"Big Momma\\'s House\" a rating higher than 5/10. I frequently snickered, but it didn\\'t look like I would ever find any BIG laughs in the film. However, that eventually changed. While it\\'s still not that consistent later on, it certainly can be funny with the things Malcolm has to do while in disguise, including a baby delivery. The scene with Sherry seeing Malcolm as himself and the FBI agent claiming to be a handyman is also a really funny part. The story and characters can also be interesting.This 2000 release is definitely not generally considered one of the great modern-day comedies, and after seeing it, I can understand why, but I\\'ve seen much worse excuses for comedy. I wouldn\\'t have been too surprised if I had thought \"Big Momma\\'s House\" was really lame when I watched it, but while I\\'m sure many people think it is, I can\\'t say I do. It is uneven, but sometimes funny. Also, there isn\\'t nearly as much juvenile toilet humour in the movie as that one defecation scene suggests! Martin Lawrence plays the lead role here. I haven\\'t seen him in any other film and have only seen a bit of his stand-up comedy, so I\\'m not that familiar with his work, but think he does a pretty good job with his performance here. This film is a little cheesy and doesn\\'t have the most original plot, and more thought could have been put into the ending as well, but if you want a silly, raunchy comedy, this particular one might work, at least in some parts.\"', '\"I have always liked Ben Stiller. He is simply hilarious. And in this movie, he is at his best. Playing the male-model Derek Zoolander who is 100% he is going to win the Male Model of the year award again (for the 4th time in a row) he is taken by suprise when another model, Hansel, takes the price. Zoolander decides to quit the male modeling business, and go do... other stuff. (as Zooland probably would have put it). But since his career is fading, a rich dude called Mugatu wants to hire him for one last job... To kill the president of Malaysia. After being brainwashed, and some other stuff, he slowly begins to understand what the male modeling business is all about. Corruption!Definetly funny! This movie is packed with hilarious jokes and spoofs (the lemonade commercial, with gasoline, had me rolling on the floor! And so did the 2001 spoof!), this is a movie you must not miss out on! As usual, in Ben Stiller movies, Owen Wilson has a pretty big part in it as well, as Hansel, the arch-enemy of Derek Zoolander. Owen Wilson is definetly too hilarious... \"The files are in the computer? Of course! its so simple!\".\\nWatch this movie, and watch it with an open mind! Its hilarious! 8 out of 10!\"', '\"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***I saw this film at its previews in Australia in July and was hesitant and a bit resistant because of all the raves from overseas. Also Renee Zellwegger had only come to Oz very briefly three weeks before for about a minute and there was no real premiere. I was glad she came but I suppose I felt it would have been nice to have her there for a premiere...I though maybe there was something wrong with the film...On first sight I thought the film awkwardly directed, not as smooth as Four Weddings and a Funeral, a bit oddly darker and Hugh Grant seemed to be hamming it up. Also there were some faltering, unbelievable moments towards the end of the film: like the big fight scene between Daniel and Darcy (they smash up a restaurant and the owner says NOTHING!)and the rather ridiculous ending (American style)where Bridget runs semi naked through the  snow in pursuit of \\'Mr Darcy\\'(who walked out of her flat to buy her a new diary without so much as mentioning to her that he was doing it! (He\\'d just stopped her from going to Paris for New Year with her friends!) Has anyone EVER seen a British woman run out into the snow in her knickers and camisole and a cardigan? I think not. British women are the greatest overdressers in the world, at least when I was there. They are very vivacious women but bold, ridiculous displays of emotional longing are not their forte. Still, I am not British so what do I know?Despite all this I thought the film VERY funny and on second viewing, despite still some of the sometimes formula direction (wide shot, medium shot, close up) there was also some very imaginatively directed scenes (the aerial shot across the wheat paddock seeing Daniel\\'s sports car and Bridget doing her Grace Kelly impersonation was bold and effective and must\\'ve taken an age, the title sequence when Bridget mouths to the song \\'All By Myself\\' was inspired as were some of the drunk scenes in her room...the falling out of the taxi etc, and the fire pole sequence.However, for my money the most riveting thing about the film (and the director has to take full credit for this too)was Renee Zellwegger\\'s performance. Considering she\\'s a Texan this was a truly wonderful demonstration of cinema acting. To me, though she still stumbled a little with the accent, she was entirely convincing as the person \\'Bridget Jones\\', she created a very believable person, at least in emotional tone. Perhaps not totally English because Renee Zellwegger has more direct access to her emotions than one sees in English women in general (I\\'m not saying they\\'re not emotional just that they don\\'t seem to display it!). Well, even more than Australian or American women if it comes to that. What distinguishes her performances (and it\\'s true also of Jerry Maguire)from other actresses is her belief in the intensity of the moment, especially in moments of intimacy in relationships.  Renee Zellwegger takes enormous emotional risks all the time (look at her weight gain for this film) and she understands the way cinema acting works outwards from sincerity and emotional openness and spontaneity. How it can radiate if you only let it. Even Julia Roberts can\\'t get near her in this department.There is an intimate moment with Hugh Grant when they are in bed together on the \\'weekend\\', when he tells her that he has to go back to work and not to the Tarts and Vicars party, when, for a few seconds, she looks at his face(a few feet away)with such intense and painful longing and love that she transcends the moment in that radiant way that only cinema can capture. I don\\'t know any other actress who does this with such easy passion. It looked effortless.There\\'s another moment with Daniel, near the lift after she\\'s been gawked at by the \\'tits pervert\\' Mr FitzHerbert, when he tries to take her aside to ask her out and she suddenly giggles. It\\'s only a moment but the giggle means everything...embarrassment at FitzHerbert, anticipation of Daniel\\'s interest and just general sense of fun. Was this directed? To me it\\'s an undirectable magic moment that must surely come out of Renee Zellwegger\\'s spontaneity. But Sharon Maguire knew about it and got many of these moments out of her actress.When Daniel tells her he\\'s engaged to the American publisher, the camera dwells on Renee till she goes out the door. The subtlety of the pain and emotional transition in her face as she leaves and the subsequent shot of her sitting at her computer, to me, is cinema acting at its emotionally balanced best. It might seem obvious to the eye but I think it is very difficult to get it on film. How often does one see even an attempt at subtlety and understated intensity in big budget movies? Most film acting, especially in love stories, is overstated and over controlled. Renee Zellwegger conveys the inner life of Bridget, the inner passion of Bridget (and all of us) so truthfully that you hardly notice it.\\nShe also allows herself to be dressed in the Bunny outfit, not very flattering, and to pull on huge knickers in a not very flattering shot. This only added to the emotional range and truth of the character. To me, it\\'s great to see an actress (now an A list actress I guess) not protecting her image of herself all the time but actually trying to act the part.I think this attitude, plus Renne\\'s magic intense moments, made Bridget Jones more than it might have been. It still has some very funny lines, a wonderful performance from Bridget\\'s gay friend Tom (?) and from Gemma Jones (as her mom) and some great use of music, though I thought putting It\\'s Raining Men over the fight scene was a bit insensitive. It\\'ll be big hit in Australia. So well done Working Title in general and Sharon Maguire in particular (though with a slight reservation).\"', '\"There is no doubt in my mind that this movie achieves its main objective - yielding a lot of laughs from the viewer. While parodying various scenes from well known scary movies, the Wayans brothers have the knack for adding one-liners that are just hysterical. Cheri Oteri as Gail Hailstorm is golden with her delivery, some of the funnier examples include chasing after Cindy for an interview and yelling \"Cindy, your ass looks fat!\", and as she recollects herself after being floored \"okay, who copped a feel?\". Anna Faris as Cindy is a real find, and spot on with her feigning of Neve Campbell-esquire fear. However, the big winner in this movie for me is Regina King, who plays Brenda. My friends and I have often found ourselves replaying her scene where she is watching Shakespeare in Love, where every line is pure gold. A must for the DVD collection.\"', '\"Awkward humor has never been my cup of tea, but in \"Meet the Parents,\" the two leads have such great chemistry that it makes the awkwardness somewhat bearable. Ben Stiller has a couple of great scenes to himself, but it\\'s Robert De Niro in a memorable role that gets most of the credit. This is one of the best parts he\\'s played in years, and most of the humor stems from his character. \"Meet the Parents\" isn\\'t well-made or \\'classic\\' in any sense of the word, but\\'s funny and quotable and has some scenes that won\\'t be forgotten.\"', '\"this movie was so funny and cute and just hilarious!!! i have seen it 50 times and i almost die laughing every single time!!!!!! it is a hilarious movie and Renee Zellwegger was at her best,  well second to Me Myself and Irene which was the best movie in the world, in my opinion anyway, well everyone should see this movie cuz it is hilarious!!!!!!\"', '\"I really wanted to like this movie more than I did.  It had great potential, considering the cast and the director.  But I feel its biggest downfall was the script, which I think tried to combine the comic elements and thriller/suspense stuff way too much. The dark side was too dark to match the laughs. This film couldn\\'t decide what it wanted to be -- funny or tense/scary, and by the end I had nearly forgotten about any of the plot twists.  I felt this was too contrived.  Nice acting, but otherwise a huge disappointment.\"', '\"when i first saw the trailer for this movie, i thought it was going to be hilarious; unfortunately it wasn\\'t as funny as i had hoped. there was a lot of vulgarity, both sexual in nature as well as rude in behaviour. the plot was very weak it was basically a comedy version of scream, since this is what 90% of the movie seem to concentrate on. the rampant drug use was also a little overboard. all in all it was pretty stupid in my opinion. some may like it but i didn\\'t care for it much. if you absolutely must see this movie, save yourself a few bucks and wait for it to come out on video, at least then your only out a couple of bucks instead of 8 or 9 dollars or more.\"', '\"Beware! In order to critique this film I may have to reveal some key plot points!! Turn back if you don\\'t want me to spoil it for you!!! OK, you were warned... I had high hopes for this movie. The trailer looked quite fresh and amusing. The first act started out cute and light, establishing the characters quite nicely. Ben Stiller (Greg) plays basically the same mensch he played in \\'Mary,\\' a likable schlub who only wants to marry his sweet, loving girlfriend and live happily ever after. But first he has to \\'Meet the Parents.\\' Actually he has to meet her father, Jack, played by Robert DeNiro. Here he\\'s basically playing the same jerk he played in \\'This Boy\\'s Life,\\' but now it\\'s for laughs, I suppose. Me? I was squirming in my seat whenever Jack was on screen. He would make any possible suitor nervous. But how can you root for Greg, who is the main central character, when the script stacks the deck so clearly against him from the outset?From the moment he arrives with his soon-to-be-fiancÃ©e at her parents\\' house, every single thing goes wrong. He says the wrong thing at every instance. He inadvertently lies because he is so nervous. Things get broken (and of course they are irreplaceable) and the cat goes to the bathroom on the debris. The cat! This cat named Mr. Jinx should have had second billing right under DeNiro\\'s name. Jack is so in love with this cat, he immediately dislikes Greg when it is revealed he is more of a \\'dog person.\\' And who tells Jack that Greg hates cats? His girlfriend Pamela! Oops, but what are you gonna do? Of course, Mr. Jinks gets lost. But how can we believe that Greg would be so naive as to think he could pass off a lookalike cat to Jack, its owner of fifteen years? Especially when the cat knows a myriad of tricks that no other cat could possibly know? Suddenly Greg is an idiot! According to the plot, Jack can read people. This means he can spot a liar a mile away. How can a man like Jack be so suspicious of everyone around him and yet not know his own son sneaks out at night, presumably to buy pot? This wasn\\'t even played for laughs. It\\'s simply an inconsistency in the plot. Later a bong is found in Jack\\'s son\\'s coat pocket. But since Greg was wearing the coat at the time, Jack thinks it\\'s Greg\\'s. Ha ha, it never stops. There are so many marijuana references, it\\'s no wonder this movie was directed by a guy named Jay Roach. Seemingly insignificant plot developments are scattered throughout the dialogue to come back and bite Greg on the butt later on in the story. More truths are revealed between Greg and Pamela that only come out when Greg is on the spot with her dad. For instance, Greg buys a special gift for Jack upon his first introduction to him. It is believed that Pamela helped him select this gift (It\\'s a rare flower that will bloom in six months.) on the condition that Jack used to be a florist. After Greg embarrasses himself thinking that Jack would loooove this little reference to his past profession, it\\'s revealed he was never a florist at all. But who reveals this? Pamela! Why would she set him up for a fall like that? Some girlfriend! The writers of this thing even give Greg a silly last name to add insult to injury. You\\'d think with a last name like Focker, that every kid Greg ever knew growing up would have mocked him so mercilessly, he would have changed it or gotten used to it by now. By the end of this movie I was p***ed off because I felt cheated. I got more agitated by everything that went wrong for poor Greg. I just wanted him to get back at Jack somehow; yell at him or something. But, no. What does this script make him do? He takes his anger out on a dopey flight attendant whose only crime was making him wait until his row was called before he boarded his plane the hell out of there. Some comeuppance.And the ending is from out of nowhere. Booooo! Liked the cat, though, and I\\'m not a \\'cat person.\\' Take that, Jack.\"', '\"What a funny movie! One of the best parodies I\\'ve ever seen.If you enjoyed (or hated) \"Scream\", \"I know what you did...\" and \"The Blair Witch Project\" please watch this one!  I guarantee it will make you nonstop laugh for 90 minutes. It is really worth seeing it.\"', '\"Next Friday, is by far the best comedy film out there today. This time, Craig moves out of the ghetto, and into the suburbs, mainly because his dad fears that Deebo will come after Craig. Deebo has escaped from jail, and he is out to find Craig. Craig\\'s father sends him to live with his uncle, and cousin \"Day-Day\". That basically sums up the story line. What made this film so funny, is the three \"Jokers\", and facial expressions. This movie has lots of funny jokes, and clever lines. Mike Epps\\' character, \"Day-Day\", is probably the most unique character in the film next to \"Joker\". I loved the screenplay for this film, mainly because it had clever lines, and funny jokes. Next Friday also has some pretty good acting, which in general make the movie even funnier. This, I think is, Mike Epps\\' first film, and I have to say that he did a damn good job for a first film. Like I said earlier in this review, most of the comedy comes from facial expressions, and clever jokes. I would have to say, that the funniest facial expression in this film, was when Mike Epps\\' character is first introduced. The character \"Joker\", is the funniest part of the film. Every time a joke comes out of his mouth, or any word for that matter, will make you laugh. When I first heard of this film, I really anticipated that it was pure crap, but then I saw it on TV, and I was proved wrong. This movie kicks ass. 10 out of 10.\"', '\"This was a cute movie for Sandra Bullock. I enjoyed the fact that she didn\\'t win the pageant and she did an okay job at portraying the tomboy F.B.I. agent Gracie. I just couldn\\'t get pass the fact that this was Sandra Bullock who is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood.They tried to make her look unattractive but even when her hair is messy and she doesn\\'t have any make-up on she can pull off her sexy demeanor with that smile and voice, c\\'mon she can\\'t be ugly even if she tried! With this aside, Michael Caine was the true gem in this film! His sarcasm had my crying! This guy was really funny, he had that same wit he portrayed in \"Noise Off\" and seemed to apply it to this flick. Benjiman Bratt did an okay job as a Sandra\\'s conceited rival. The problem was that you can tell that two were going to hook up in the movie before you get to the middle of it. All in all a very funny movie with some predictable parts in it but still worth watching.\"', '\"This film is one of those hard to find films that will cheer you up even when you think no one else can. it is like a best friend! This film is about an FBI agent going undercover to a beauty pageant or a \"scholarship program\"! But she is a complete tomboy, she has never worn make up before and has never worn a dress before. This makes the film even funnier because Sandra Bullock plays the character so well that it really looks awkward for the character she is playing - Gracie hart. It makes you constantly laugh all the way through with its witty comments and overall excellent acting By Sandra Bullock sometimes i wonder where she gets her facial expressions from she is brilliant! There is a serious side to it because of the reason she has gone to the beauty pageant someone is planning to do something bad there - we find out later that they are planning to blow up the beauty pageant winner and her surroundings. There is also a love theme going along which you don\\'t think will work out but we want it to! Overall it is a brilliant, superb, hilarious, wonderful (any other words you can think of that mean brillianto!!!) i love this film and will remain my favourite film forever!\"', '\"One of the best movies of the year!  Yes, I know we\\'re only 1/3 of the way through the year but will you please go see this movie?It is a romantic comedy but I know of lots of guys who will want to see it too.  I couldn\\'t stop laughing.  Hooray for Bridget!  Hooray for independent, overweight (although Renee Zellweger is not), single women everywhere!And of course the two gorgeous leading men don\\'t hurt the movie AT ALL...Despite the buzz about Renee Zellweger being horribly miscast, I think she did a great job.  Also hot were Colin Firth (whoah!) and Hugh Grant (again playing the loveable rogue).Hooray for Bridget Jones!\"', '\"Those of you who feel the need to blast this film need to just take a pill and relax!  \"The Whole Nine Yards\" is just plain popcorn fun--no substance, just harmless enjoyment.  Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis work great together, and the screenplay is very funny.  I didn\\'t expect to enjoy this film, but I thought it was hilarious.  So set aside your egos and higher-brain functions, folks, and just sit back and laugh.  A lot.\"', '\"I really enjoy watching this movie because it does a fantastic job as a parody of more recent horror movies.  It was very well written, full of very funny jokes and everyone did an excellent job with the roles that they played.  This film aims for fun and laughs and definitely hits the target.\"', '\"Scary Movie is a parody of the teenage slasher genre, and luckily a very funny parody indeed. Keenan Ivory Wayans is the mastermind, and he has assembled a fairly standard group of teenagers and a psychopath, and gives them the opportunity to completely spoof the slasher genre. The \"plot,\" such as it is, happens as a result of the teenagers out cruising with much hard alcohol accidentally hit someone, mistake him for dead, and then accidentally kill him when they throw his body into the bay to dispose of it. We suspect that somehow the victim rose from the dead or recovered to be the psychopath, but we are never quite sure. The psychopath, with a bunch of hilarious changeable masks out of the Scream movies, attempts to kill all the teens, but has some misadventures along the way.This movie is completely shameless, and anyone with a sense of decency should be warned. If you do not mind this issue, however, the movie has some great laughs. One scene that sticks out in my mind pretty much encapsulates this movie\\'s strategy: at one point, the killer opens the door on a bunch of teenage boys who are watching TV and smoking ridiculous amounts of pot. They are completely helpless and about to get slaughtered when one of them has the presence of mind to offer the killer a smoke. After a few puffs, everyone starts laughing hysterically together, and then they all decide to start making threatening phone calls to potential victims (giggling all the time). The scene has an ironic ending that I will not give away for fear of tripping the spoiler alert. The killer has lots of moments where things don\\'t go right and you think, man, it is tough to be psychopath. The teenagers are a study in human superficiality and often seem to preoccupied with their own issues to notice that they are slowly being sliced and diced. The sight gags are quite good and their are some legit surprises that keep you guessing. All in all, it is an hour and a half of quite effective tasteless entertainment.\"', '\"Scary Movie is probably the first of all these \\'(Insert here) Movie\\' spoofs which usually mock a certain genre with a bunch of gags so inept, so pathetically juvenile and so harrowingly unfunny that if they weren\\'t also vulgar and offensive they could have been written by a class of 5 year olds. This is one of the first in the notoriously unsuccessful spoof genre. But, believe it or not, this one is perfectly OK. The jokes are hit and miss, but when they hit they are genuinely funny. The film feels considerably less desperate than many spoofs and is (slightly) less juvenile. It\\'s extremely low and earns its 18 certificate with ease, but the vulgarity isn\\'t always completely mirthless. It is offensive, but manages not to overstep the line. It is admittedly quite funny at times. The reason why my rating isn\\'t higher is because not all of the jokes work, it can be very annoying and leans too heavily on crude jokes. The thing which really irritates me about Scary Movie is its spoofing of Scream, which was itself a parody. This is not the level of The Naked Gun, which is my favourite comedy ever, or Airplane, and does run out of gas before the end but this represents a partially successful parody of horror movies which at the very least is funny sporadically and is miles better than the cinematic wasteland of Disaster Movie and Meet the Spartans.6/10\"', '\"When MISS CONGENIALITY came out, I remember how it got lukewarm reviews (at best) and did so poorly in the theaters that it was offered as a free pay-per-view film with the Dish Network. I assumed the movie MUST have been terrible for them to just give it away and I am surprised I actually watched it. To my surprise, however, it was most enjoyable...though mindless (at times).The film is one of these ones that you simply must suspend all sense of disbelief--otherwise it simply won\\'t work. Sandra Bullock going from tom-boy FBI agent to nearly winning the Miss United States pageant was a bit far-fetched to say the least. But, if you can do this and stop your brain from nagging you, you\\'ll find that the movie is often delightful.Now you may have noticed that I didn\\'t say this was a great film or a must-see. The movie did have some rough spots (despite some people giving it a 10, this and very few movies deserve a 10). The biggest problem for me is that the setup for Bullock\\'s character went way overboard. Sure, we are supposed to see her as a tough lady--I understood that. But they really went too far--often making her seem too tough to be real and, at times, unlikable. First, no lady who is built like that is going to be the Terminator....tough, yes, Terminator, no! Second, when she met the character played wonderfully by Michael Caine, it was as if the director gave her instructions to behave like a boorish pig. Seeing her eat with the manners of a Doberman was just too much--no one is THAT obnoxious when they eat (at least once they pass age 6). Third, the transformation was just too quick.Now, aside from these difficulties, the film was a delight at times because although the script had problems, it also had some very witty dialog and a cute resolution. In other words, it worked despite its flaws. Partly this was because when not acting boorish, it\\'s hard not to like Miss Bullock. Partly this was because she had some excellent support. And, partly this was because this is a silly little film and silly little films are not supposed to be Shakespeare or a Merchant-Ivory production--it\\'s allowed to be slight yet fun.Overall, a nice time-passer but far from a must see or a 10, though Bullock still \"scores\". Also, I\\'ve seen this one more than once and it holds up very well with repeated viewings despite its few deficiencies.\"', '\"This movie is basically based on: 1. Scream series 2. Face off 3. I know what you did last summer 4. The sixth sense 5. The matrixWell written but a bit too much on some part which can be said extremely funny and outrageous.\"', '\"From the trailers I thought this would be a funny horror spoof... mostly it was just kinda gross, not a \"Something About Mary\" gross, just nasty bodily fluid gross.  The acting was ok but the same jokes over and over wore out pretty quick.  The violence extreme and was almost exclusively against women to the point where it made me uncomfortable and I own \"I Spit on Your Grave\" on DVD.  I will admit to laughing for the first 20 minutes or so but after that I just wanted to leave and it would seem that the rest of the audience agreed as it was incredibly silent in the theater.  A few brave souls walked out but I tried to have faith the film would get better.  There was nothing original or subtle about the humor ... everything was obviously lifted from other films and then went nowhere.  I suppose if you\\'re up for a few, ok more then a few, penis jokes this would be your film, but if you\\'re looking for a good horror spoof save your money and hit the video store.\"', '\"Next Friday is somewhat less annoying than its predecessor. It feels like this movie is trying to assemble a bit more plot, so I\\'ll give it credit for that. However, it\\'s not structured all that well to tell its story. Instead, this movie feels like a bunch of vignettes that are trying to be humorous. I still wasn\\'t laughing this time, but I could understand where others might. There are several running gags that keep coming back in Next Friday, and I feel like they could work to make the right audience laugh out loud, even though I was a bit bored by them all. For me, this movie is sorely missing Chris Tucker. He was the only thing that even made me chuckle in Friday, so losing him for Next Friday was a big blow. Mike Epps brings nothing to the table, at least in terms of comedic energy, and he plays an obnoxious character. His father and the father\\'s girlfriend aren\\'t much better, and they keep popping up throughout the film.One thing I feel like I need to mention is how offensive this movie seems. It plays into so many racial stereotypes that it kind of made me uncomfortable. I didn\\'t mention anything when I saw this stuff in Friday, because it was basically 100% black people in that film, so I dismissed it as one of those things I don\\'t have the right to question. At the time it felt like when a black person says the N-word, because it\\'s ok for them to say it, but not for others to even think it. But in Next Friday it\\'s not just a black cast, they are adding in offensive Latin stereotypes, and it pushed me too far. It\\'s not funny, and it isn\\'t the kind of thing that should make people laugh, that\\'s for sure. On the flip side, I think what made this sequel a bit more tolerable, and what got me to crack a smile a few times, was the physical comedy. There were some decent pratfalls and other goofy gags that work. Yet, even though Next Friday wasn\\'t completely miserable to watch, it\\'s safe to say the stoner-comedy genre isn\\'t ideal for me.\"', '\"Looking at these reviews it seems the viewing public have forgotten that this is a spoof. It was never going to be a mind-stretcher like The Usual Suspects, so if you can tell who the killer is straight away that\\'s probably part of the irony! Furthermore those who have warned others about taking their children to see the film have clearly lost sight of the fact that R-rated movies are rated so because they are likely to confuse or repulse young children, or go straight over their heads. So they shouldn\\'t be watching the film anyway - the very fact that it\\'s called Scary Movie and that Laverne & Shirley from 1976 is referenced should indicate this! There aren\\'t as many phallic images as made out either. There\\'s one full-on one in a photograph, the rest are all disguised.***POSSIBLE SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH***I think most of the negative press stems from lack of understanding of the film references, of which there are a lot. I had seen just about all of the movies parodied, but there were some blank faces around me - for example, if you haven\\'t seen The Usual Suspects, the ending will seem fairly standard and won\\'t have the extra irony it presents for those who have. On which theme, being from the UK I seem to have missed the Budweiser \\'Wassup?\\' parody that people have found funny - perhaps someone could e-mail me to clear it up? Cheers :)All in all I found Scary Movie hilarious and recommend it despite the occasional disgusting moment. My only criticism is that, at times, it seems like a re-run of Scream with the occasional improved line thrown in from another film, and one or two of the jokes are embarrassingly unfunny e.g. the Spice Girls reference. That said I\\'d give it 8/10, well worth seeing!\"', '\"I saw this movie in 2002. I was, I remember, in a rather low phase those days. I\\'d actually gone for another movie but ended up buying tickets to this as the one I went for had a full house.Boy! I guess my stars led me to it! I left the hall fully entertained, satisfied and strangely with full of hope and a new vigor! The movie cheered me up and made me forget my sadness. I simply felt lighter and happier. And, although little over carried away as I might seem, this simple pleasure the movie brought me and the positiveness I felt is certainly worth sharing.Rene is truly truly fantastic! what an achievement for her! she totally deserves her best actress nomination and should have won it too! see the work! What an acting! A girl from the glamour world that she is and doing that and with such real effects that we can\\'t help it but be totally CHARMED by her despite the character\\'s many faults. Absolutely lovely and heights of romance! Back then, I did not know Colin Firth and had not yet seen him in Pride and Prejudice (Classis! Classic! Classis!). The man blew me away! I fell in love with him and set out on a rampage to find all his works! He\\'s a perfect dream man. And Hugh Grant just sizzles the screen with his perpetual mega play boy good looks. He played his role wonderfully and was really really funny. His attitute and mannerism towards his treatment of Mr.Darcy is a roar. Darcy, so uptight and he, so loose and free - each thinking himself more up than the other. He entertained me the most! all three of them are marvelous in the movie! The story is fascinating! Unconditional love. two pole ends meeting and finding they suit each other. To have someone love you just the way you are even if you are a little pathetic..etc..etc. Go see the movie & enjoy. Think happy thoughts and escape to fantasy land. The ones who are unsatisfied with the movie should try it out again just for the mind\\'s sake.I rate this 10 out of 10 for pure entertainment.\"', '\"This is just too much fun. Perry and Willis have great chemistry. A comedy-thriller that will keep you guessing about the next plot twist. Supporting cast is a delightful blend of sexy and goofy. Rent and enjoy!\"', '\"I think my single sister and I both thought this movie was gonna be about a woman and her independence.  Instead, it\\'s just another romantic comedy.Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s hilarious for the most part, I just didn\\'t think it would have so many romantic links in it.The previews made Bridget look like she was \"through\" with men and was proud to be single.  But she was never through with men.  She just was just tired of meeting bad ones.  And she hardly ever writes in her diary. WHAT\\'S UP WITH THAT?But Renee Zellewegger (or however you spell her name) once again, proves that she is a FUNNY ACTRESS.  I thought she was great in Nurse Betty and she is even funnier in this movie.I just wish the ending would have been a little more original. But overall, this is a very entertaining movie.8/10\"', '\"Bridget Jones\\' Diary is a romantic escape into the life of an imperfect singleton and the little events and habits in her life that we find amusing -- probably in part because we are each a little bit like Bridget and want to be accepted and loved. Who hasn\\'t been embarrassed by their parents, unintentionally made a fool of oneself at a social gathering, wore the wrong clothing (or costume) to a party, dated the wrong person, or messed up at an interview? Bridget Jones\\' Diary is lovable and funny because it is believable and deals with these every-day events, though usually with a cruel or embarrassing twist at the expense of poor Bridget.Overall, Bridget Jones\\' Diary is an excellent example of a romantic comedy, and its popularity is gained through lovable and quirky characters that are easily sympathized with. Although the same lovable characters appear in the sequel, the humor is not nearly as imaginative and not focused around the everyday little events. Watch Bridget Jones\\' Diary is you\\'re looking for a light and funny film. Don\\'t bother with the sequel unless you\\'re a major fan of the genre.\"', '\"ZOOLANDER is one strange film.  Its sort of like a full on assault on the brain, spitting out so many weird ideas and creative jokes all at once that its impossible to catch them all.  The plot is so bizarre and haphazardly constructed that talking about the story almost seems irrelevant.  It is probably useful information to say that the plot has to do with assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia and involves a somewhat disturbingly funny funeral scene that overlooks the city of New York. These events would be disturbing enough if we hadn\\'t all witnessed the WTC attacks a few weeks ago, but now they seem just so disturbing that the scenes seem appropriate.  This perhaps made the film much darker than it needed to be when released, but perhaps the way in which these events are presented, as being rather dark and still humorous, that this film seems awkwardly precient in a way.Still, as I said, the plot is irrelevant.  What makes ZOOLANDER important is that it is probably the funniest film of the year, at least for me.  Sure, its not as wholesome as BRIDGET JONES\\'S DIARY, and it perhaps didn\\'t have the unexpected charm of RAT RACE, and it wasn\\'t as much fun as RUSH HOUR 2, and it wasn\\'t as good of a film experience as SHREK.  However, it is perhaps the most consistently funny film I have seen, and the biggest laughs are probably the most creative of the year.  Overall, the film is so packed with cleverly conceived and executed ideas that just thinking about each individual scene provides entertainment in itself.  My favorite scenes include what happens when Zoolander and his friends go out for Orange frappucinos, the orgy scene, Zoolander\\'s film prepared for his nomination VH1 fashion awards, and the quite unexpected yet wholly appropriate 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY reference.  I\\'m laughing very, very hard just thinking about these scenes.  I wasn\\'t quite certain how much I liked the film right after seeing it, but now I\\'m certain that it has provided quite enough entertaining memories to sift though.If you let your mind think about it too much, it is perhaps easy to find ZOOLANDER offensive, or find the plot ludicrous, or realize nothing makes sense, or realize that you can\\'t explain why your laughing.  But I would advise you just let your inhibitions go.  The good laughs here are some of the most refreshingly original laughs in years.  The only thing keeping this film from achieving cult comedy status from the likes of films such as THERE\\'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, WAYNE\\'S WORLD, or AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY is that it isn\\'t quite well thought out enough to truly be as effective as a whole.  It all just sort of fizzles out at the end, when everyone realizes that there\\'s no way you could possibly lead up to with that incomprehensible of a plot.If the trailer of Zoolander seemed incomprehensibly stupid to you as well as unfunny, don\\'t go and see it.  However, if you laughed at Zoolander\\'s trailer and are dying to see it, go on, as it is at least as funny as the film\\'s trailer.  There\\'s a lot of weird stuff here, but it all flashes by so quickly that it will all wash out of your brain very quickly.  Unlike many comedies, the hilarious moments are the parts that stuck in my mind after the film and all the bad stuff washed away, which is something I truly appreciate.\"', '\"Usually, most movies that are full of bad language aren\\'t affected by their profanity. However, this is not one of those movies. Somehow, I found that the profane dialogue brought down the rating of this movie very much. Or it could just be the fact that it was hard to sit there listening to every curse that was said as I was watching it with my dad, and although I am 20 years old, it is still highly uncomfortable to watch certain things with your parents. Another reason this movie wasn\\'t nearly as good as I had hoped, is the fact that Paul Giamatti played his part extremely poorly. I don\\'t know how he could possibly work for the FBI for he appears to be a terrible agent. There\\'s many other reasons for this movie turning out to be mediocre, but I\\'ll summarize everything now. You might enjoy it, or, you might get somewhat disappointed. Only count on an overall rating of in the middle of bad and good. Trust me, I hadn\\'t, and I was extremely disappointed.\"', '\"Okay, so maybe in the beginning Sandy (that would be Sandra Bullock but I love to call her Sandy) plays her character Gracie Hart a little too caricature and overblown in terms of the grotesque tomboyish nature she is trying to bring out in this character, but once that phase is over and she has established to the audience that Gracie\\'s not just your average girl, Sandy relaxes and the laughter begins. Her character Gracie Hart is an FBI agent who is lured into a beauty pageant by her partner and interim boss (played by the ever alluring Benjamin Bratt) to help foil the plot of a recent terror threat the Bureau received regarding the next Miss United States pageant (not to be confused with the Miss America pageant). And if you\\'ve seen the way Gracie Hart was just introduced to the audience in the scenes prior to the announcement that she will now be the new Miss New Jersey, then you know that whoever has the task of turning her into a beauty queen sure would be needing tons of therapy after-wards (and that is if they succeed). The scenes play out in such a funny manner that if you do not laugh as Gracie is being transformed into pageant material then, maybe something is wrong with your funny bone. Anyways, if you study the characters very well as they are introduced to the audience when Gracie finally completes her transformation, it won\\'t be too hard for you to figure out where the terror threat came from. But if you\\'re one of those people who can still enjoy films without over-analyzing it, then sit back, relax, enjoy and be shocked by the surprise twist and ending. There is one scene that did bother me though, when the queen was crowned and one of the runner-ups (who turned out to be a lesbian) had an outburst. It was not only tacky, it seemed forced and they should have left that on the cutting room floor. Nevertheless, Sandy and Benjamin have an on screen magic like you\\'ve never seen before. As they say about chemistry, you either got it, or you don\\'t. :-)\"', '\"I saw this movie on Pay-Per-View when I was on holiday in the USA, as I wasn\\'t sure if I wanted to spend money on cinema tickets. I\\'m glad I saw this movie, but wish it was at a cinema!Sandra Bullock is superb as FBI agent Gracie Hart, and adds some great humour to the average script. She has a great sense of comic timing, and really has good on screen chemistry with Michael Caine as the beauty coach, Victor Melling. This film was brilliant, and I cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. Definately worth seeing again! 10/10\"', '\"Ignoring the obvious stale \"plot\" development, this film should be enjoyed for what it is, a very funny British film (with an American lead!) in the style of Four Weddings. Lots of good belly laughs to be had here and well worth seeing (with or without previous alcohol unit consumption).\"', '\"Scary Movie offers itself up as a parody and that it most definetly is. Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, The Matrix, I Know What You Did Last Summer all are referenced. The secret to enjoying it is to go into it with the mindset of a 14 year old.  Then you will be blown away.  Most of the jokes work on that level and that\\'s what should be remembered.  Overall the mostly unknown cast does well with the script they have, but it still has to be realized that most of the jokes in the movie are very low-brow with a lot of shots being taken at blacks and gays.  So for the intellectuals out there, avoid this movie, but for everyone else go see it!\"', '\"I live in Montreal, I like Bruce Willis and comedies. So I don\\'t know if you should really listen to what i\\'m saying... all what I can say is that this movie is really funny and it really shows our city as it is instead of hiding it just like everyone else does. I\\'m just waiting for it to come out on DVD to laugh another time. Really a great way to spend your bucks if you like to laugh!\"', '\"Great, acting by Anna Ferris and also it\\'s funny really funny. Almost every part made me laugh, I wish the rest of the sequels can do that. Parody or spoof of I know what you did last summer and scream 1 and 2. I mean this movie does not deserve a mixed review or 6.2 based on franchise meaning it deserves a 7.6 or a very positive review. In this movie has very famous actors and actresses. Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Nia Long, Anna Ferris, and Carmen Electra. With also the deceased Prince playing a small role in the movie. Of course the movie has references to the deaths and in the ending every one is revived no one is dead really. A scene I really adored was the scene of Buffy setting murdered. It basically shows the clichÃ©s in horror films today. It really makes a great debut for a film.\"', '\"I laughed, I cried, I laughed, I cried, I rinsed and repeated about twenty-four times, and then the credits rolled.  Sounds mundane and derivative?  Well, perhaps a bit, but this was nonetheless an awesome feel-good group hug dramedy that makes a great date movie and a great flick to see with a group of friends.Renee Zellweger turns in an awesome performance in the title role.  Her accent is surprisingly good -- she can even sing and yell well with it. Hugh Grant shows awesome range in his acting.  Well, not really.  He\\'s usually the stuttering cute moron or the annoyingly gorgeous jerk and he\\'s the latter in this one.  Still, good job there chap.This is definitely a chick flick, but one of those good ones that has poignant moments and a cool plot amidst the emotional rollercoaster.  Check it out, it\\'s worth your two hours.\"', '\"Sandra Bullock again delights us with a good comedy, this time massively backed by the public, which led to the realization of a sequel.This movie is made for her, and she is worth it. It totally takes the weight of the plot and full of humor and spontaneity. Far from films like \"Big Momma\\'s House\" or \"White Chicks\", \"Miss Congeniality\" has gags great, both physical and verbal. And is that the Bullock is an expert in the art of making laugh, so much that his interpretation in this film earned him his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Comedy Actress, with much merit since they are never nominated for performances in such films a bit serious.The transformation of a rude FBI agent into a refined Miss is hilarious, and the plot of the film is not very silly, the tape does not fall into the gross humor, or in situations too ridiculous, so it is very hilarious and funny, but not a bomb.As a side note the always effective Michael Caine and Heather Burns (the little blonde Miss who befriends) who dominate the mood almost as well as Sandra. On the other hand Benjamin Bratt as always in his line of puppet that does not contribute absolutely nothing to the tape, honestly the race like actor of this lad is never going to take off ....The American critics applauded the performance of Sandra and the audience went massively to the cinema, everything is said. One of the best films in the Bullock\\'s career, with a sequel that could not keep the bar so high, was difficult.The best: Sandra Bullock, almost takes the Golden Globe. The worst: A romance with so little importance could be deleted.\"', '\"I very rarely find myself going to comedies. Most are either geared for teenie boppers or as dumb as a bag of hammers. This film was somewhat refreshing. It had a neat story and great performances. DeNiro and Stiller are perfect together and I am glad to hear that they are considering a sequel to this film. If only Ben could talk his father (Jerry Stiller) into signing up for it, that would be a heck of a good time. This movie is not rocket science and I think some critics have dogged it as a result. However, that is silly. If you want to see two great actors battle each other for 90 minutes, you cannot do better than this film. Just think, a major studio release that is actually a good movie, how rare.\"', '\"I don\\'t smoke but I have nothing against smoking.  But what did it help the movie by having every single character smoking 24-7?  I couldn\\'t get past someone talking with a cigarette in their mouth throughout the entire movie. Please, hollywood, you don\\'t have to have every single character in a movie smoke.  It doesn\\'t help the plot whatsoever.\"', '\"I am so sorry to hear people say that the movie is funny. I believe that Scary Movie could be funny to people that were locked in a library for 30 years with no one else to talk to and suddenly someone played it to them. The jokes are unintelligent, the acting is terrible (like in most of Wayans\\' movies) and what comes out is a sense of rudeness to the audience. Toilet ans sex jokes at their worst, plus a joke about Usual Suspects that originally appeared in Wrongfully Accused. Now that I mentioned it, did you know that in contrast to this super-production the hilarious \\'Wrongfully Accused\\' was filmed in only 5 days? (there\\'s even a very good I have to say, recreation of the Matrix visual fx in a scene of Scary Movie). Of course W.A. was created by veterans and in a parody no one really cares about the visuals; what really matters is the jokes. And these jokes are like the jokes you hear in a classroom during a Physics class. Awful!\"', '\"this is, without a doubt, the biggest pile of putrescent garbage it has ever been my misfortune to watch. i would rather jam spoons under my eyelids than be forced to sit through that ordeal again. Bridget Jones is a brainless tart who sets the women\\'s movement back about 50 years. my boyfriend thought it would be romantic to watch it together. he was wrong. this film reinforces every bad female stereotype there is. the characters were unbelievable and extremely annoying, the acting vapid and fourth rate. i consider it an insult to my backside that it had to suffer the discomfort of prickly cinema seating for the duration of this dross. if Bridget Jones were a real person, i would track her down and beat the crap out of her. if you haven\\'t seen this film, please, PLEASE do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague.\"', '\"It\\'s not entirely clear why Ben Stiller continues to get work and acclaim for his performances, since he really doesn\\'t do much at all. His main role in any given film is to stand there and look dumbfounded as the world falls apart around him. He played one of his most successful versions of this when he played Gaylord Focker. The first time was in \"Meet the Parents\", which was a remake of a little seen independent film. Stiller plays a male nurse, a detail that punctuates several of the running jokes. He goes home with his fiancÃ©e for a wedding, at which point Murphy\\'s Law strikes, his patience is tested, and all of that.Robert DeNiro is here too, fresh off his uncharacteristic comic turn in \"Analyze This\". He plays the fiancÃ©e\\'s overbearing, ultra-critical, highly suspicious father. It\\'s a role that was originally slated for Christopher Walken, who would have ruined it with an added sense of creepiness. The main meat of the film comes from the tug-of-war between DeNiro\\'s psychological testing and Stiller\\'s struggle to be heard and accepted. This is a classic formula that works surprisingly well as a modern-day screwball comedy, given the weaknesses in Stiller and his irritating and frequent co-star Owen Wilson.\"Meet the Parents\" is a formulaic comedy with a bit of a dark streak. It\\'s a decent movie with some memorable bits, but it\\'s more of a trial to get through than enjoyable which is something ironed out in time for the sequel.\"', '\"This movie was a wonderful surprise.  I went to see it with few expectations and without having read the book.  I left the theater completely obsessed with this funny, interesting, and realistic character. There are many things that make this movie great but i think that the most important thing would have to be the wonderful performances by the entire cast.  Renee Zellweger was wonderful as the of balance and less then graceful Bridget.  Hugh Grant, who is ussually quite the good guy, changes his stripes in this film to produce a funny and believable character, and Colin Firth reprises his Darcy role (one that he originally portrayed in 1995 for the BBC Pride and Prejudice a film very worth checking out!).I can not stress enough how great this film is and how worth viewing it is.  This film is one of my all time favorites because it is so sweet and funny.  This is a film that almost anyone could relate to no matter what age, sex, or place in society and can be enjoyed by EVERYONE!\"', '\"i saw this movie on tv and found myself laughing all the time. Bruce willis and Matthew Perry are wonderfull in it. I cant wait for the whole ten yards to come out. if its anywhere near as good as this then i will see it the day it comes out. i recommend this to anyone and everyone\"', '\"Bridget Jones is a woman who is tired of being lonely, tired of drinking and smoking too much, and who doesn\\'t like her weight. She isn\\'t picking the right men either.  She decides to start keeping a diary, so she can see where to improve her life.I really enjoyed this movie.  It was satisfying, very funny, and very sweet. It\\'s a great movie for lovers of all ages.  The acting was terrific, Hugh and Colin were both BEAUTIFUL, and Renee is obviously going to be a very big star!\"', '\"For those of you who haven\\'t seen previews for this movie, don\\'t let the title fool you. You are much more likely to be offended by this movie than scared by it, but then that\\'s the point of this horror movie spoof.There were portions of this movie that I thought were extremely funny. There were other times when the jokes, especially involving sight gags, went too far. The audience that I viewed this film with was in agreement with me on much of what I found distasteful as evidenced by the groans I heard around me. The acting is actually quite good and ideally suited for this type of film. This movie is better than I expected it to be, but it isn\\'t spectacular. You will probably get a lot more enjoyment from this picture if you have seen the movies it is parodying.  If you are offended by crude humor or are planning to watch a movie with someone else who is, I would definitely recommend that you avoid this film. However, if you are willing to risk the excesses of this movie, there are some laughs to be had.\"', '\"A British woman (Renee Zellweger) is determined to improve herself while she looks for love in a year in which she keeps a personal diary.Whether or not this is a good film depend on who you are, I suppose. Romantic comedy is not really my cup of tea, and this one is more romantic and less comedy, so it may be even less my cup of tea than just the average romantic comedy. I like Hugh Grant and Renee Zellweger, and this was a good role for Colin Firth before he went A-list... but still, following a woman\\'s love life is not my preferred subject matter.Why this ended up on my list of things to see is completely beyond me, but now it has been seen and cannot be unseen. Let us chalk this up to taking one for the team.\"', '\"\"Scary Movie\" is a movie that parodies many scary movies, mainly \"I Know What You did Last Summer\". It follows a group of teens, most of them dying by the end, who are being killed by someone masked like the killer in \"I Know What You did Last Summer\".Unlike most parodies that aren\\'t in this franchise, this is not a tongue-in-cheek parody. Tongue-in-cheek parodies mock the original, but still stick with whatever theme they are parodying, \"Shaun of the Dead\" is one. But Scary Movie is just stupid.One big complaint I have is that it doesn\\'t really point out any stupidities in the movie it parodies, it just uses really immature humor that doesn\\'t mock Last Summer at all. The only thing they really pointed out is the odd plot in Last Summer, or the sequel, I forget.I give this film a three out of ten, since it\\'s not some ungodly abomination sent to Earth my Satan\\'s little helper, but it still sucks big time.\"', '\"Other than watching Nia Long who plays Sherry and is easy on the eyes there is little of interest in this movie. Mainly because it appears contrived with laughs reliant on disguises and mix ups, which has been done to death.Also it intrigues me that it\\'s not okay nowadays to make jokes about most types of people yet it\\'s fine to paint fat people as laugh objects. If not done intelligently, the idea falls flat.Don\\'t pick on the fatties or leave everybody open to ridicule, if comedy\\'s the aim.\"', '\"Male supermodel Derek Zoolander is on the way down after three years of continuously winning the \"Male Model of the Year\" award. When he is beaten by the hot newcomer Hansel, Derek starts searching for a new meaning in his life. Fashion czar Mugatu offers Derek a comeback in his new \"Derelicte\"- line. Nobody suspects that Mugatu plans to assassinate the new Malaysian Prime Minister on his visit to New York, so that cheap child labour is still available for Mugatu\\'s fashion producing. By brainwashing Zoolander, Mugatu and his associates create a willing killer to do the job. By Lampooning the brilliant Manchiurian candidate, Stiller here has made his finest film to date. The film is that brilliant, that, apart from Dodgeball, every film he\\'s been in has been hugely disappointing. And it doesn\\'t help either that he\\'s been promising a sequel to this for years.Why is it so brilliant? Stiller isn\\'t the best looking person in the world, but he convinces as Zoolander, he and Wilson convince as supermodels, and it just makes a mockery of the fashion world.Do the many cameos of the fashion world not know that this film is contradicting everything a supermodel stands for? And it all starts with his face....The cast are brilliant, the cameos are surreal and hilarious, and Ferrell is brilliant as Mugatu.It has a strong similarity to the 60\\'s movie Danger: Diabolik, but it doesn\\'t rip the film off, it just pleasantly homages the film.It\\'s still pretty fresh after nearly 13 years, but Stiller could be a one trick pony.His other films are pretty lame.\"', '\"Stationery Warning: \\'Zoolander\\' is NOT meant for the Pseudo Intellulectuals nor is it for those who prefer black-comedies. \\'Zoolander\\' is non-stop, non-sense, yet funny & lively.

The characters, the situations, the entire execution, everything is either over-the-top or completely zany. Yet, it raises the correct amount of hilarious moments, that make this one a genuine slap-stick entertainer. Stiller\\'s Direction, on the other-hand, is fast. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are appropriate. Costume Design, is quite good. Performance-Wise: Stiller is superb as Zoolander. He plays the dimwitted model, with great energy. Christine Taylor supports well. Owen Wilson is astonishing as Zoolander\\'s opposition. He brings the house down with his impeccable comic-timing. Will Ferrell is funnily menacing. Milla Jovovich is perfect. Jon Voight & David Duchovny are memorable in brief roles. Others lend good support. On the whole, \\'Zoolander\\' has, and will always, appeal to those, who relish slap-stick comedies.\"', '\"I laughed at this movie, but remember when the promo clips came out for this movie, it was tailored for kids.  I am surprised that it got a \"R\" rating, but then again what is the big deal about the male genital!!!  The industry have been showing women practically full blown for years in the nude. Bottom line, it was ok and glad I waited to rent the DVD, and it is not for kids, period.\"', '\"Rated R for strong crude sexual humor, language, drug use and violenceI didn\\'t see Scary Movie 2 but I saw this, the third and the fourth Scary movie, and this is definitely the best.The others are very funny don\\'t get me wrong.Even with the PG-13 rating they are funny.This and Scary Movie 2 are both R-rated.Who knows? Maybe the next one will be R-rated.Scary Movie is basically a spoof of slasher horror films, mostly Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.All the Scary Movie\\'s are like that, spoofing popular horror films.The plot of the movie is basically like all other slasher films, there is a killer on the loose who is killing all the friends of this one girl.So now she must stop him before she is next.Pretty much the same story as the others, but this film cleverly spoofs those other slasher films.Scary Movie is a very funny movie and I recommend watching it if you want a good laugh.\"', '\"Now here is a rare breed: a mainstream movie that works at just about every level without dumbing anything down or making the average viewer think too hard. \"The Whole Nine Yards\" is a great movie to simply sit back and enjoy.Nicholas \"Oz\" Ozeransky (Matthew Perry) is a mild-mannered dentist whose stuck with a wife who hates him (Rosanna Arquette in a hilariously over-the-top performance) and a huge debt that his partner (his father-in-law) left him when he kicked the bucket. Then his new neighbor moves in. This neighbor, much to Oz\\'s horror, is none other than Jimmy \"The Tulip\" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), the infamous hit-man for the Gogolak gang. Oz\\'s wife tells him that they should rat Jimmy out to the Gogolaks to get a \"finder\\'s fee.\" Oz obviously refuses, but agrees to go when his wife agrees that if he does this, she\\'ll give him a divorce. Thus begins a hilarious story of double crosses, new romances, and hamburgers with mayonnaise.The cast is first rate. Matthew Perry is in full panic-mode, and his reactions to the situations he finds himself in (and their resulting consequences) are hilarious. Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as Jimmy. It\\'s a typecast role, but Willis plays him with a slight tongue-in-cheek. It works wonderfully. While it allows for plenty of laughs, it also gives him an air of menace, which adds another layer to the humor. We are aware of Jimmy\\'s capacity for violence, but the way Willis plays it results in moments of laughter mixed with suspense. Natasha Henstridge radiates a cool sexuality mixed with vulnerability as Jimmy\\'s ex-wife who falls for Oz. Michael Clarke Duncan is also well-cast as Jimmy\\'s fellow hit-man, Frankie. Kevin Pollack and Rosanna Arquette are so over-the-top that their performances must be seen to be believed.But as good as this cast is, and it\\'s great, the film is stolen from all of them by newcomer Amanda Peet. It takes a great performer to steal scenes with actors at the top of their game. But Peet didn\\'t just steal her scenes, she walked away with the whole movie. Peet is positively delightful as Oz\\'s ditzy receptionist, who has more of a part to play in this than anyone realizes. Peet is hysterical; her performance should have at least gotten her an Oscar nod, if not a win.\"The Whole Nine Yards\" is a mix of film-noir and screwball comedy. Director Jonathan Lynn has a lot of fun with the conventions of each genre, including mixing and matching the character traits of the femme-fatale and the \"good girl\" (you\\'ll see what I mean when you watch the movie). What I really liked is that the humor of the movie is not over-the-top exaggeration humor (like The Farrelly Brothers). This is more about timing and dialogue; it\\'s like a 1930\\'s screwball comedy without the Hays Code. To be sure, the film does not leave out the trademark of the noir genre: the twisty plot. \"The Whole Nine Yards\" boasts plenty of surprises, and quite a bit of suspense. Just because this is a comedy doesn\\'t mean you can tell where it\\'s going.Mixing these two genres would seem impossible because more often than not, one would dilute the other. But Lynn manages to walk the line between the two opposite genres and play them both equally well. The film is well-paced, and the timing on the jokes is perfect. There are no over-the-top visual effects, and that\\'s a good thing.\"The Whole Nine Yards\" may not be classic film material, but it\\'s highly entertaining. And with a movie like this, that\\'s just about all that one could ask for.\"', '\"Taking popular films from the 90s and replicating specific scenes and plots to create a spoof film sounds incredibly lazy. Surprisingly the originality comes from transforming these horror films into comedic sketches that will certainly make the originals less scary. A group of high schoolers have their past come to haunt them as a masked serial killer slashes his way through each one. Borrowing the plot of \\'Scream\\' and entangling it with threads from \\'The Usual Suspects\\' and \\'I Know What You Did Last Summer\\'. Wayans attempted to include as many film references as possible, and half the fun is identifying them. \"Ohhh there\\'s \\'The Matrix\\' 360 freeze frame!\", \"the classic \"I see dead people\" line, niceee!\" and \"Amistad II instead of \\'Titanic\\'? Sure, I\\'m onboard\". Certain imitations were hilarious such as \\'The Blair Witch Project\\' woodland run and the cinema viewing of \\'Shakespeare in Love\\'. It\\'s certainly a good time when with friends, but is it actually a decent film? Well, yes and no. The horrendous overacting is humorous at first but quickly becomes tiresome as Cindy consistently screams in fear and runs away like a headless chicken. For me, a large portion of the slapstick humour and \"witty\" dialogue were misses. These spoof films rely on you watching the films that it is attempting to mimic, so if you haven\\'t watched any you will not find this funny at all. At the time of this review I haven\\'t seen \\'Miss Congeniality\\' so the entire beauty pageant scene was wasted on me. The script relied heavily on visual comedy which mostly comprised of grotesque uninspired actions such as farting inconveniently. May have been funny in the 70s but not anymore, come on. What this flick does do is introduce us to the character Brenda who, whilst criminally underused in this, is a massive highlight in future sequels. This is, for me, my least favourite of the original trilogy. A solid watch if you are drunk with friends, but unfortunately comes across as unintelligent and unfunny for most of its runtime.\"', '\"The Wayans tend to disappoint with their all to common satires; \"Don\\'t Be A Menace to South Central...\" but this time, I would have to say they put a bit more effort into it and made it a success. The movie shows that it can successfully pull off a spook about satires.\"', '\"There wasn\\'t a moment that felt boring in this movie during the entire 104 minutes.  This is a great movie that can make you laugh.  There are no complicated plot twists or deep meaning of life.  This is a pure comedy with a role tailor-made for Sandra Bullock\\'s charm.  Forget about \"28 days,\" \"Forces of Nature\" and \"Practical Magic.\"  \"Miss Congeniality\" is the movie if you are looking for light-hearted fun at a theatre.\"', '\"Hilarious scenes throughout the whole movie hide a real lack of depth or appeal for this movie. Don\\'t get me wrong, I still liked it but behind the laughter there wasn\\'t really anything else going for it. It even copied from \"I know what you did last summer\" etc by running over someone and dumping there body into the ocean. I mean, c\\'mon, couldn\\'t they have thought up something themselves?65%\"', '\"What can I say about this movie except it\\'s possibly one of the worst movies of it\\'s type ? I\\'ve sat through movies on the Lifetime Channel with my girlfriend that were better than this ( and that\\'s saying a heck of alot bub. ) Avoid this movie like the plague people.\"', '\"Bruse Willis as the hit man \"Jimmy Tulips\" and Matthew Perry as the hapless dentist \"Oz\" are funny in this movie. I was charmed by the dental assistant Jill, played by Amanda Peet and Jimmy\\'s wife Sophie, played by Rosanna Arquette. Michael Clarke Duncan\\'s character, \"Frankie Figs\" was powerful. This is an entertaining movie with some funny skits, but it isn\\'t really for all audiences, primarily because most of the characters in the movie are \"hit men\" and trying to kill each other. The fact that a policeman actually was killed during the mÃªlÃ©e of hit men killing each other is something that I wish had not been in the story - but to be fair, I\\'ve watched the movie twice and the first time I watched it (probably in 2000), I didn\\'t think anything about the policeman being killed.\"', '\"Sandra bullock in her prime as FBI agent turned undercover beauty pageant contestant Gracie Lou Freebush. The storyline is fairly well developed, the acting pretty good, and the actors well cast. The jokes land well and often. This is of my all time favorites, endlessly re-watchable and quotable \"With all this foil in my hair I\\'m getting HBO\"\"', '\"\"Scary Movie\" is a funny spoof, for sure. But it is not the best of all the \"Scary Movies\" in the franchise. That being said, don\\'t get me wrong here, because this movie is fun and entertaining, especially so if you enjoy comedies that is a spoof on other movies.\"Scary Movie\" does have an overall storyline, which is very similar to the storyline found in \"Scream\", although elements from other famous movies are thrown into the mixture to spice it up. And it does work out quite nicely.The list of movies and TV series that are being spoofed is just great. I didn\\'t catch all of these spoofs and references, not by a long shot. And if you enjoy spoof comedies, then you should check out those listed under the \"Connections\" heading and then \"Spoofs\".The laughs are bountiful throughout \"Scary Movie\" and the comedy is really great. It was right up my alley, so I was really amused by the comedy throughout this movie.The cast list in \"Scary Movie\" was also quite good, and those cast for the roles were all doing good jobs and individually brought something unique and nice to the movie. And this really lifted up the movie quite a bit.And \"Scary Movie\" is also the movie that brought the \\'wazzup?\\' thing and made it popular.\"Scary Movie\" is entertaining and funny, although you must like spoofs in order to really appreciate this movie (or the franchise as such).\"', '\"Well, I wonder.  Can\\'t rightly say wether I liked the movie or not because I don\\'t think normal reactions apply here (if you\\'ve seen the movie, you know what I\\'m talking about).  I think the real issue here is how far gross-out movies will have to go after this.Cause this movie was REALLY bad.  Not bad like, \"oh, what a stupid movie\" but bad like, \"oh....my.....\"If you have no idea what I\\'m trying to get at by now, all you need to know is that NOTHING was left to the imagination.\"', '\"I suffered through an hour of this movie TRYING to get interested enough to finish it. I finally did finish it but could have stopped watching it at any time and never have given a second thought as to what happened at the end. I cannot believe big name actors such as Bruce Willis ever agreed to star in such a ho-hum movie :(\"', '\"I love this movie. I\\'ve seen it a dozen times and it never gets old. My dad always laughs because when it is on I watch it again and again no matter how many times I\\'ve seen it. It is one of my favorite movies. I just love how simplistic it is. This movie is so hilarious. I love it so much. Although I wouldn\\'t recommend the second Miss Congeniality because it was not even close to as good as the original. If you like Sandra Bullock at all you will love this movie. Sandra Bullock is by far my favorite actress and Benjamin Bratt is such a cutie. If you love romantic comedies this one\\'s for you. If you haven\\'t seen this movie yet I highly recommend it to everyone.\"', '\"To those who havent seen it, dont miss out on this movie.  This spawned crappy TV shows like The In Laws and Meet My Folks, so you can definitly say this is a modern trendsetter.  Robert DeNiro and Ben Stlller were perfectly casted for these roles.  This movie promised laughs and garuntees enjoyment, and maybe an addition to your list of favorite movies.\"', '\"One year ago, a group of dumb teenagers dispose a man they accidentally killed. One year later, the teens are being stalked by a serial killer. Could the dead man be alive?The film\\'s main spoof is obviously Scream, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, and Scream 2. The famous \"first ten minute\" scene in Scream is spoofed in the prologue of Scary Movie, where Carmen Electra comes in to make a cameo, like all Scary Movie film does.This film is very funny, crude, and gross. No wonder the franchise is a huge success in the box office. Anna Faris, the main character, is the heroine. She gives a funny performance. The teens are REALLY DUMB in this film. If you like smart comedies, stay far away from this series. When the killer kills the characters, we wouldn\\'t care because it might be funny or because the characters are just too stupid to die.There are many \"laugh-out-loud\" moments in this film. It has some really clever jokes and some just gross out, which spoofed a sex scene in Scream. This film ranks #3 out of the 4 (or even more) films in the series. It\\'s not bad considering the higher two are even funnier.If you\\'re just looking for a comedy that you can shut off your brain on, then watch this film. If not, then don\\'t. This film is clever, funny, and just plain stupid. Go see it!\"', '\"The Wayans brothers are certainly talented and generally funny but this movie is tailor made for 14-year olds.  The premise is good and the parody references are well chosen, but the film relies too heavily on the typical early teen mix of jokes.One interesting side note is that they bring back many faces from In living Color such as Kelly Coffield (who hasn\\'t been seen since the show ended)\"', '\"The titular Bridget Jones is in her early thirties, smokes too much, drinks too much, thinks she is overweight and most worryingly for her single. Her mother tries to set her up with stuffy lawyer Mark Darcy but she takes an instant dislike to him. Instead she ends up dating her boss, Daniel Cleaver, who is clearly a cad and a bounderÂ… who claims Darcy once took the woman he was engaged to. Over the course of the film she comes to realise she is with the wrong man but by then it might be too late.I probably wouldn\\'t have picked up this film if it hadn\\'t been on the 50p bargain shelf at the local charity shopÂ… I\\'m glad that I did though as it was a lot of fun. There are plenty of great laugh out loud moments and Texan RenÃ©e Zellweger does a great job as the English Bridget. She is ably supported by a cast of well-known British actors; most notably Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as Darcy and CleaverÂ… it was particularly fun watching Grant play the cad rather than the sympathetic male lead; not that he plays the two all that differently! It was also a highlight to see the two scrapping; not a well-choreographed fight but a believable brawl with them kicking, punching and grabbing each other in a messy but realisticÂ… and hilarious way. Overall an enjoyable way to pass an hour and a half; it may be considered a bit of a \\'chick-flick\\' but blokes can enjoy it too!\"', '\"I didn\\'t quite hate this movie, it had it\\'s moments.  Most of the funny stuff was sexual in nature, everything else was pretty bad.  If you want to see this movie, I suggest renting it or better yet have a friend rent it to save you a couple bucks.\"', '\"Zellweger\\'s electrifying and charming performance as the quirky and awkward titular heroine single-handedly made me, at least for a moment, think that this conventional and predictable rom-com is way more witty than it actually is. I mean, I didn\\'t expect to sympathize with such a character as I did. What really infuriate me is that I don\\'t think this film needed to be that silly and schmaltzy at all. It had potential to be worthy of Zellweger\\'s exceptional performance if it ignored the conventions of its sub-genre and the unnecessary, redundant twists near the end. Actually, I think it would have been much better if it had leaned towards being dramatic than farcically comedic. Regardless, it\\'s still a delightful and endearing film. And, to be honest, I love it just as it is!(7/10)\"', '\"You know, Scary Movie should not be known as Scary Movie. Probably Perverted Movie. Why, I don\\'t think this is even a movie at all. This has got to be the sickest piece of trash I have ever watched. And I thought Talos the Mummy was bad. This is unspeakably stupid in every way. The plot does not exist because this...thing for no reason switches to a needless sex scene or some other perverted scene just for the sake of putting one there. None of those scenes have any relation to the movie, if it was one. In fact, you might think you are watching a different film when the scene switches abruptly to a sex scene. As for the scenes that satrize films like the Matrix, Sixth Sense, Blair Witch Project and Scream, those were done poorly because the actors genuinely look like they were trying hard but unsuccessfully to imitate the scenes. The actors...are just pitiful. Anyone who would agree to act in such a film is either perverted or in desperate need of money. The acting is the same boring thing every time. For instance: person sees killer, person becomes supposedly \"scared\" and panics, killer stabs person. Whenever any of the main characters see the killer heading towards them with a knife, its always the same reaction. Their eyes go wide and the go \"Oh My God! Its him! Run!\" After about 5 times of the afore mentioned it becomes less funny and more stupid and pointless. I\\'ve heard a lot of good and bad remarks about this waste of my time. Please, if you\\'re quite sane, save yourself from this sad excuse for a movie. Otherwise, open up and eat the bad trash.\"', '\"It\\'s a standard Hollywood movie, but a clever script, Zellweger\\'s performance, and an excellent supporting cast lifts this predictable story to a level well above most of the romantic comedies. Hugh Grant is perfectly cast as the devilish \"bad boy\", and Colin Firth is the only choice for the rather thankless role of reprising Mr. Darcy of \"Pride and Prejudice\" (he is a very good actor but in most American movies he plays a pompous and humorless jerk; at least here he is a generally sympathetic character). But as good as all of these actors are, it\\'s Zellweger that carries the movie. Her performance is perfectly nuanced -- she\\'s funny, adorable, and goofy, and manages to convey just enough pain during her character\\'s misadventures to be touching, while still letting you laugh.It\\'s an ideal date movie, and she\\'s still as cute as a button with the extra weight she put on for the role.\"', '\"This movie is very funny, Sandra Bullock is at her best here and her supporting cast are just as funny if not even more. Micheal Caine here is incredibly funny as well as Benjamin Pratt. The characters in this movie seem to \"gel\" well together and act exactly proficently.This movie is extremely funny and even tries to shift some of the mystique surrounding beauty pagents away, unsuccessfully in my view however. There are some simply class bits in this movie, for example the bit on the plane and also when Bullock is being made over, but at the same time there are some bits which are so inane and boring that i wanted to throw my tv out of the window! Fortuantly however, those bits are few and far between, there are very few of them and the movie on the whole is something that i would gladly see again and again due to its brilliant casting and also its very funny outlook.\"', '\"Seriously, I turned this movie off. I thought it would make me laugh out loud. I heard it was smart and funny. I have been lied too.Scary Movie has to be the worst spoof I have ever seen. It is not at all funny, just dumb and offensive. The horrid jokes include dumb teenagers accidentally touching each other, policemen defecating, stereotyping and people cross-dressing. There is even one scene where a girl gets stabbed in the breast and, when the knife is pulled out, there is a chunk of ice attached to it. (I later found out that all it was stating was that the actress had breast implants. Bad joke.)Instead of actually laughing, I found myself saying \"What?\" when trying to figure out the humor. The only funny part was the man who was thought to be dead, but really wasn\\'t, and that was hardly funny at all! I turned it off after the movie showed a picture of a man\\'s genitals. How repulsive. That is solid proof that it is a bad movie, because I have sat through the Cat in the Hat and Jaws: The Revenge. On a second viewing, I found two funny parts. The first was the \"Can you see me?\" part, and the second was \"Does Scream have a plot?\", but they couldn\\'t hold back on the disgusting scenes, could they? The cross-dresser scene and hair coming out of the underwear scene were very, very disgusting and repulsive.This movie is the first movie I have ever rated a 1.1/10\"', '\"I was out with a few people the other night and i was dragged in kicking and screaming into watch this \"Film\". Lets just say the only people who could possibly enjoy this \"film\" are insomniacs because it will certainly put them to sleep!! It\\'s not funny, it\\'s not clever it\\'s infact boring dribble!!

Stiller wrote, directed, and starred in this hilarious and ridiculous comedy.Zoolander is a dumb, but hilarious character. He is naive and full of himself. Stiller plays it a little over the top, but it works. Stiller makes us feel what Derek Zoolander feels even though we as audience are much smarter than Zoolander.Owen Wilson plays Hansel, a new up and coming model who becomes a rival of Zoolander\\'s but then they become best friends. Stiller\\'s wife Christine Taylor plays Matilda Jeffries, a news reporter who feels that she needs to help Zoolander get out his slump.Will Ferrell and Milla Jovovich are great supporting players. Ferell plays Mugatu, a costume designer who wants to end Zoolander\\'s career. Jovovich plays an employee of Mugatu\\'s who does some of Mugatu\\'s dirty work.Ben Stiller\\'s dad Jerry does some funny work as Maury Ballstein, Zoolander\\'s agent. He is caught in the middle between Zoolander and Mugatu.Stiller makes a ridiculous idea and makes it over the top and it works. This is a fun movie and one of the starting points of the frat pack. This movie\\'s popularity will keep rising.\"', '\"This infamous Wayans brothers horror/comedy spoof rivals \"Freddy Got Fingered\" for sheer tastelessness. To begin with, there\\'s the \"penis attack\" scene. Yes, you heard me. A character is attacked by a penis. And that\\'s just a warm-up. Later on, we get the part about the geyser of semen. No, that was not a typo. The writers of \"Scary Movie\" act as if they had never heard of good taste. Given the evidence (the Wayans gave us \"In Living Color\") that\\'s probably not too far from the truth. The criteria we must use to evaluate the film is extremely simple: is it funny?Well sometimes it is and sometimes it isn\\'t. In addition to those mentioned above, there are countless gags and horror movie parodies. Some of them fall flat, but there are enough hits to compensate for at least some of the misses. I laughed several times, but the film suffers from too many dead spots, especially during the third act. How you respond to it is purely a matter of taste. If gross-out comedy isn\\'t your thing, what are you doing here anyway?In closing, I must give credit where it\\'s due. Anna Faris provides a strong screen presence, guiding us through the movie\\'s weaker moments. She\\'s not gorgeous by any stretch of the imagination, but she has an undeniable appeal. In fact, she would have been right at home in an actual horror film. Let\\'s take it a step further.

Teenager fun but damn funny at the same time. It\\'s a horror comedy. That is the new genre that Scary Movie has invented horror comedy.

As lighthearted as it is lightheaded, this daffy spoof of conspiracy thrillers and the mad, mod world of male models and other hipsters has a surprising undercurrent of sweetness to it. Star/director/co-writer/co-producer Stiller plays dopey Derek Zoolander as a gentle, essentially kind-hearted naif under his hip veneer. The same is true of Owen Wilson, putting his twang and quirky humor to good use as Derek\\'s rustic yet hippy-dippy rival-turned-ally Hansel. I suspect folks will like ZOOLANDER even better on DVD, since there are tons of hilarious extended scenes and deleted scenes as well as the original Zoolander TV sketches that Stiller & Co. did for VH1. As Derek says in the voiceover intros on the DVD menu, the ZOOLANDER disc is a wonderful introduction to \"the world of DiviDuh\"! :-)\"', '\"It is absolutely amazing that this film was able to sneak past the censors in its current form.

Another scene I saw in the trailer and thought was pretty funny was when the sherif shows the fake-Neve Campbell \"some photo\\'s, tell me what you think\". In the trailer, a good short laugh, in the movie it just goes on and on and on and on....In short, just watch the trailer on the internet and realize that 90 minutes of this nonsense is a bit too long.\"', '\"I just rented the DVD and this movie is even better on the second viewing.

They go to her parents house and that is where the fun starts. Robert De Nero is definately getting a lot better at comedy and in this he is very funny as an ex CIA over protective father. There are many funny scenes in this film including the Cat and the Urn sketch and the airport scenes and Ben Stiller carries them off to perfection. Very enjoyable. 8 out of 10.\"', '\"When I first saw every preview, I\\'d think I\\'ve seen every joke there. But am I wrong! It had me laughing all the way, from beginning, the hospital \"practice marriage\" all the way to the end! This story directed By Jay Roach (Who directed Austin powers 1 & 2) is original and hilarious. It revolves around Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) who wants to marry Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). To make Pam fall in love with Greg was easy. Before Greg could propose, he figures he needs to get the parents\\' approval. So he goes to Pam\\'s parents\\' house in long island. I know it\\'s Long island because a certain scene was filmed in Manhasset.Greg tries to impress Pam\\'s father (Robert DeNiro)and mother (Blythe Danner),but each step he tries to make,is one bad step he messes up. Then, Greg finds out he can\\'t be with his future wife. He must sleep in the basement. He finds out Pam\\'s father, jack Byrnes, is with the CIA, resulting in a very great game of.. Lie Detector. That\\'s basically the plot, I don\\'t want to spoil it for you.DeNiro gives a great as protective father with a cat,Ben Stiller in his best role ever, so far. Blythe Danner is marvelous, reminding me of Sissy Spacek from \"Blast From The past\".DeNiro and Stiller have the funniest roles, and always give a good hearty laugh. I have never heard an audience laugh this hard. I watched the movie 5 times and I can\\'t get enough of it! The audience roared with laughter at Stiller\\'s funny antics, and DeNiro\\'s comeback to shine.This movie is pure genius. Even better than Happy Gilmore. I can\\'t help but laugh. My sides burst out as well! I recommend it to anyone. So if you haven\\'t seen it on the big screen, see it NOW. Better than Scary movie. Scary Movie is nothing compared to Stiller and DeNiro. Two BIG stars, one great movie you have to see.\"', '\"It had been a long time since I have seen a comedy; however, Meet the Parents was well-worth the wait.  Robert DeNiro, who is one of my all-time favorite actors, is brilliant as Jack Byrnes.  I felt that his performance for a comedy was even better than his role in Midnight Run.  Ben Stiller was also excellent as the guy who has everything possibly bad happen to him. Terri Polo, Blythe Danner, and James Rebhorn are solid in supporting roles, but it is Owen Wilson that really shines.  Keep an eye on him--because he will be a star.  A lot of people have been badmouthing this movie, but I feel that it was a really well-written and acted movie.  I think some people were expecting too much or are hard to please.  If you are a big fan of Stiller and/or DeNiro you must see this movie.  I feel that this movie is a must-see anyway.  10 out of 10.\"', '\"Renee Zellweger\\'s accent is uneven, but the rest of this enjoyable what\\'s-a-gal-to-do comedy is spot on.  Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are both excellent in the two major male roles.  The situations are mostly believable.  The \"Greek Chorus\" of Bridget\\'s friends is perfection itself, and Bridget\\'s mum and dad are ideally portrayed.  Sit back and enjoy.\"', '\"Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen. I went into the movie with low expectations, it is a spoof after-all can\\'t expect much. Overall the Scream and the entire Trilogy and among my favorite films of all time. So the idea that the cynical banter would be lightened and made fun of as cynical banter sounded like it was capable of holding at least some humor in it.Despite these low expectations it was still a disappointment. In fact this is now among the highly select group of movies I have walked out of, consisting only of the Touch of Evil rerelease and the live-action Spawn movie. This movie takes bad taste to a new level and attempts to out-gross anything that the Creators of American Pie or the Farrely brothers could even dream of. It lacked any sort of value and the humor was entirely geared towards the stupid, hormone driven teenage male.This movie is a complete and utter waste of time and money and despite the fact that I didn\\'t pay for it at all, I still wish I had been given something to at least somewhat equal that squandered hour of my life that will never be returned.\"', '\"Ben Stiller stars, directs and co writes the movie.Zoolander is a dim witted supermodel that becomes a pawn in a plot to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia by corrupt fashion executives one of them played by Will Ferrell, who wants to retain cheap labour.At the beginning of the film we see Derek Zoolander being ousted as the top male fashion model by the rising star, Hansel McDonald played by Owen Wilson.His reputation is further diminished by a critical article from journalist Matilda Jeffries played by Christine Taylor.Zoolander retires from modelling rejoins his family in the coal mines but Derek is not cut out to be a miner and he later accepts Ferrell\\'s offer to appear in his next fashion show.The film is silly but the genial good nature of both Stiller and Wilson carry it through.The absurdity of the plot sort of keeps things ticking over. The film was not a big office success but seemed to have found an audience in later years via TV and DVD.It may not be laugh out funny, supermodels are of course an easy target but it did make me consistently chuckle and there is a good soundtrack as well.\"', '\"I find it hard to put into words how bad this film is. Scary movie is supposed to be a spoof of all the horror movies that have hit our screens over the past few years. The problem is i thought spoofs were meant to be funny. This is so amazingly unfunny it is hard to believe.I sat through this movie , stunned at how bad the so called jokes were. The was only one funny moment in this film and that was when the Gym teacher revealed her secret. One funny scene in 90 minutes is as bad a it gets when it comes to comedy. I find far too many Hollywood films stink like Scary Movie and i have come to the conclusion that it is the childish American sense of humour that does not appeal to me. Why does every US comedy involve farting? It was funny first time round with Blazing Saddles but why have we had to endure it in nearly every other American comedy since? Have they never heard of overkill? This film is so bad that the only way to sum it up is to say Please, please dont waste an hour and an half of you life with it. 2 out of 10.\"', '\"Remember these movies:Wreseling Ernest hemmingway, Love potion #9, The net, While you where sleeping, When the party is over, a time to kill, speed, speed2 cruise control, 28 days, forces of nature & Practicul magic, they where all good but this on \"Miss Congeniality\" A.K.A \"Miss Undercover\" Is here number one hit so far. Great actors in it like Benjamin Bratt, Sandra Bullock, Meliss de Sousa, William shatner, Micheal Caine(to be true, his first good movie), Candice Bergen and Ernie Hudson.From pretty to very pretty Sandra stars in this perfect Miss usa pageant. My words are everybody has to see it, and can\"t hate this movie. For me it is really my number one movie.\"', '\"This movie would be an unbearable tragedy if it were a true story; but since it\\'s not, it\\'s hilarious.  Laugh-out-loud funny.  Many of the physical gags are along the line of \"National Lampoon\\'s Christmas Vacation.\"The ending is a little unbelievable, but still one of the funniest movies I\\'ve seen in quite a while.\"', '\"And totally hot! So hot. She may have put on weight for the role but American born and raised Renee is super gloriously gorgeous as Brit Bridget Jones on a whole \\'nother scale that\\'s difficult to calibrate! She\\'s so pretty and not fat. This is a really sexually forward movie with all the butt touching and dirty talk and all, am I lame, or are these guys creeps? A little bit of both. I love Renee. Her laugh is intense and she looks so \"wanking\" amazing in her underwear in Bridget Jones\\'s Diary and in her bunny costume too, wow. This funny movie is so hilarious and really quite good. Bridget\\'s narration is great! I\\'m a single hot intellectual sweet pervy unlame dude & I love BJD! It\\'s so precisely, balls to the walls, exactly my type of movie that it\\'s difficult to calibrate. I Loooooove Renee Zellweger!!! She\\'s my fav and so sexy and funny and so hot.\"', '\"This film tries to get us to like these cold blooded murderers ~! I\\'m sorry, but I cannot like or relate to a cold blooded hit man ~! The whole premise of the movie is that this hit man is a nice bloke, but he aint! That girl dentist is the worst actress in the history of motion pictures, never once ceasing to annoy the viewer! The whole romance plot is a shocker, and you just can\\'t wait for it to end!! Why won\\'t Willis get it together and make Die Hard 4, and quit it with crap like this?!?!\"', '\"I think I must have different contact lenses from the other people who\\'ve commented on this film.  Either that, or I saw a different film.                      ***SPOILERS AHEAD***First of all, I have to say that I found this a mildly amusing film with some good moments that made me laugh out loud.  I also have to agree that Renee Zellweger does a fantastic job playing Bridget Jones:  she\\'s plain, gawky, funny, warm, sincere, and a real twit all at the same time.  That said, I confess it took me a little while to warm to her character, partly because Bridget is such a twit.  I mean, she\\'s 32 years old and she doesn\\'t have a clue how to fix a meal for friends?  She automatically assumes that first-date sex is inevitable even before a relationship begins (hence the underwear angst)?  She cannot string two words together without babbling?I guess the thing that bothers me the most about this film, though, and people\\'s glowing reactions to it, is wondering what Bridget and Mark are going to talk about from now on.  I mean, he\\'s a top barrister with education, money, social standing, and a variety of interests, humanitarian and otherwise.  Bridget, on the other hand, seems to have no interests, other than drinking, smoking, feeling sorry for herself, and catching a man. She\\'s not intelligent, well-educated, committed to anything, or even with the prospect of being a viable, supporting housewife.  At least with Daniel, cad though he clearly is, [I muse cynically here] she had fun--and so did Daniel.  Fun and Darcy don\\'t actually go in the same sentence! In the end, I thought she ended up with the wrong man.I walked out of the movie theater a bit disappointed.  I\\'d heard lots of good things about this film, and although it has some good moments and some funny lines, and Zellweger\\'s acting is commendable, I thought the film just didn\\'t live up to expectations.\"', '\"After i had seen it at the cinema i immediately bought it it was so cool and if you are also  a fan of Sandra Bullock like myself you\\'ll love this but anyone will enjoy this comedy which will keep you laughing all the way through.Sandra Bullock gives an excellent performance playing FBI agent and Tomboy Gracie Hart. I Recommend this,everyone will love it.A+++\"', '\"This movie is to chick flicks what \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather Part 2\" are to guy movies. It\\'s on TV just about every day of the year on one cable network or another. \"Miss Congeniality\" is hardly great art, but it\\'s a lot of fun and holds up better than a lot of similar films. Sandra Bullock is irresistible as \"Dirty Harriet,\" a grungy FBI agent who goes undercover as a contestant at a beauty pageant to foil a terrorist. She\\'\\'s transformed from nerd to bombshell with help from a prissy pageant consultant (the always brilliant Michael Caine). Bullock\\'s pratfalls are endearing, and her musical wine glass playing is reason alone to see the film. Heather Burns is likable as the beauty queen Bullock befriends, and Candace Bergen and William Shatner are in their campy glory as the pageant\\'s hosts. Unlike other beauty pageant comedies (\"Smile,\" \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\") \"Miss Congeniality\" treats its subject with affection rather than disdain. It\\'s a movie both men and women can enjoy.\"', '\"Derek Zoolander(Ben Stiller) was once the best of the modeling industry, but after losing the \"Best Model of the Year\" award to a rising model named Hansel(Owen Wilson), his career is winding down. Noticing Derek\\'s downfall, a huge modeling campaigner Mugatu(Will Ferrell) puts Derek as the face of his new line of clothes. The only problem is that every major assassination of the past two centuries has been initiated by the modeling industry and Derek is brainwashed to be the assassin in the next murder. With the help of Hansel and a reporter named Matilda(Christine Taylor), Derek tries to escape the evil scheme that he is capable of committing.The movie, as you can probably guess, is just hilarious. Ben Stiller is absolutely fantastic and this is the first appearance of his wife, Christine Taylor and did a great job also. Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson just add on the greatness of the movie. Overall, the movie is one of the funniest movies of the decade.I highly recommend this movie.\"', '\"It all started so strongly, back in 2000, a comedy film which shone light on the very popular horror film \\'Scream\\' was released and it became an instant hit, a cult classic in fact. The latest movies are unrecognisable when compared to the original, so re-watching it last week really brought back some memories from my teenage years. The movie is downright stupid and it knows it. Following the scream storyline very closely and re-enacting the scenes with a slapstick comedy twist was original and brilliant at the time. It is so absurd and silly but it completely works.It is written by and stars the Wayans Brothers so that should give you a good idea as what to expect from the film. The cast is well complied, perfect for a teen horror/slasher movie so when put into a spoof spin off film; they really fit the part and make it all the funnier.You honestly have to take this movie for what it is, It really won\\'t be to everybody\\'s taste and there will be many, many people who find it crude, distasteful, offensive or simply not to their humour all together. For me though it is brilliant, the strongest Scary Movie out of them all, it didn\\'t complicate things and stuck to mocking 1 movie (with a couple of others thrown in here and there), something which changes drastically over the later films.It\\'s a popcorn flick, have a few beers, sit back and enjoy it for 90 minutes. It still holds up after all these years.8/10.\"', '\"Too close for comfort, but great for a laugh!  Despite the fact that this movie strayed from a beloved book, I thought it really captured the spirit that made Bridget Jones so lovable and someone with whom I could identify. I must admit, I had severe doubts as to whether Renee Zellweger could be \"normal\" enough for me to have that feeling in movie, but she did a fabulous job of really submerging herself in the character and within 60 seconds I was laughing so hard both with and at her.  Hugh Grant did a fabulous turn in a character that is deliciously out of character.  Colin Firth is perhaps the most beautiful stoic ever.  Must say, I liked this movie beyond all expectation and I think it ranks among my favorite date movies of all time.\"', '\"This movie made me laugh from start to finish.  Absolutely hysterical!  It pokes fun at the \"Horror\" films of the last few years like the Scream movies, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and a couple more.  Hilarious and definitely made for mature audiences.\"', '\"I loved this movie. This movie introduced me to Ben Stiller\\'s work. Him and Robert Deniro were a perfect match. The cast was wonderful and worked well together. I can relate to the plot, it seems like any time one is trying to impress another something is bound to go wrong. Poor Greg (Ben Stiller) just seems to have the worst luck. It puts a different perspective on how airlines deal with people. The airline doesn\\'t handle baggage very well and so I can understand why he would not want to check his bag again. The fact that he said \"Its not like I have a bomb\" does not make it less funny just because 9/11 happened. If airlines actually took things this seriously then they might have prevented 9/11 from happening. So those who don\\'t like this scene should lighten up and not take it out on funny movies made before the horrible event occurred. I enjoyed this movie very much.\"', '\"One word sums up this movie: Idiotic.  British humor can be funny.  `Men Behaving Badly\\' and `Coupling\\' are very funny British shows I see occasionally on BBC America. But, for the love of God, this movie is positively not funny.  It also is complete foolishness, not funny foolishness but utter foolishness.  Sleep inducing foolishness.  Most of the characters are unlikable in almost every way.  Bridget is not very intelligent to put it lightly.  Her escapades I assume were supposed to be amusing but were more or less annoying.  Hugh Grant is by far and away my least favorite actor of all time.  If I had known he was in the movie I would most likely have skipped it altogether.  Colin Firth\\'s character was the only character I enjoyed watching.  He at least had some kind of intelligence and depth along with a little mystery and intrigue.In short, I wrote this because I am flabbergasted at how highly this movie is rated here.  To put it in simple termsÂ…This movie sucks big time.  So for those of you who have not seen this film and say to yourself `IMDB ranks it high so it must be good,\\' think again.  Easily one of the most boring and meaningless films I have ever seen.If you wish to see a good Renee Zellweger movie see Nurse Betty or Jerry Maguire.  This one is pitiful.\"', '\"Is there anything more nerve-wracking or heart-racing than meeting your significant others parents for the first time? This seems to be more of an obvious fear for the male in a heterosexual relationship than it is a woman\\'s; the desire to make a presence that\\'s simultaneously meaningful and respectful, but not too brazen, is a tricky dance to accomplish and the anxiety that accompanies such an event is usually too much to even begin to adequately articulate. One winds up overthinking everything to the point of either saying something they didn\\'t mean to say or feeling like they have just made a complete fool of themselves in front of the person they love and her own family.I suppose I can rest easy knowing that writers Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg have made a \"worst case scenario\" film about the subject, which effectively makes almost any evening spent with the parents of your significant other seem desirable and successful in comparison. Jay Roach\\'s Meet the Parents is the kind of film that takes those fears and persistent worries and etches them into a film that ups the stakes so high that, after a while, it becomes difficult to laugh given how far the film has fallen from its own sense of realism. it takes a realistic and common fear and repeatedly throws so many incredulous situations towards it, turning it into a farce, that, by the end, it\\'s not only hard to take the film seriously, but the characters as well.We meet Gregory Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse who has been in a relationship with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) and is working to execute the perfect marriage proposal as soon as he gets off work. Just before he\\'s about to pop the big question, Pam gets a call from her sister that she is now engaged, right after her fiancÃ©e asked Pam\\'s father for her hand in marriage. While Pam claims it isn\\'t necessary to do such a thing, it\\'s a sweet, traditionalist gesture. As a result, Greg keeps his plans under the wraps and agrees to go to Pam\\'s family\\'s home in Long Island for the wedding.Upon losing his luggage on the flight, Greg meets Pam\\'s father Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother Dina (Blythe Danner). Right off the bat, Jack is cold and offputting to Greg, emphasizing Greg\\'s less-than-positive view of cats and his own career choice of being a nurse. This sets the tone for what will be the next few days - awkward, uncomfortable interactions that will revolve around Greg trying to please Jack, but, in the end, only resulting in frustration or anger on Jack\\'s behalf. Things only get intensified when Greg winds up meeting Kevin (Owen Wilson), Pam\\'s ex-fiancÃ©e who is helping organize her sister\\'s wedding.Meet the Parents has a committed cast of greats, starting with De Niro and Stiller, the two obvious, and even making strong uses of Polo and Danner, who transcend supporting roles and have a few of their own moments to shine. Consider Polo\\'s character consistently trying to tow the lines of loyalty to her father and express her love for Greg, while Danner\\'s character\\'s cheeriness is usually diminished by the sternness of her husband. The glaring effects of the male characters on the female characters is an interesting dichotomy, especially seeing as the female characters are the whole reason everyone is brought together.Other than that, and some surface relatability based on the basic premise of the film rather than the actual details, Meet the Parents is one long sitcom. The film houses a barrage of overblown sight gags, caricatures instead of characters, and a case of \"maximum antics, minimum laughter,\" where the writers continue to dogpile awkward scenarios on the characters while forgetting to humanize the characters in order for the gags to actually work. This is less a film and more an assortment of asinine events that work to beat the audience down with slapstick and a great deal of comedy that is almost too desperate to be funny.Meet the Parents will get empathy points from many, but the points it receives from its obvious brand of comedy should be relatively minimal. There\\'s an appalling lack of human interest here outside of the film\\'s concept, which is a big problem when you have a film that has the ability to resonate very deeply with people. Many of us have been in Greg\\'s situation and many of us have found ourselves to be the worst enemy at times, but these elements, while substantial and ripe for exploration, can even be taken in a haphazard manner.Starring: Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner, and Owen Wilson. Directed by: Jay Roach.\"', '\"ok, first things first - r the british gonna get completely stereotyped? hugh grant, colin firth and renee zellewegger(how do u spell her name!?!) give VERY posh accented performances - not the all the british r posh ya know! anyway, back to the film, i thought it was brilliant, i couldnt get into the books, but this had me rolling around on the floor in hysterics - hugh grant in the rowing boat and then in the water - a classic! renee was very good, the accent, though posh, was impecable, and colin firth - all i can say is that 4 a guy his age, he is very good-looking - YUMMY! the characters were developed well, the other sub-plots (what was with that guys face from the shopping channel?!) and just the performances in general made this a really enjoyable film and i\\'m glad i that i\\'ve seen at last! 10/10\"', '\"This is actually a very clever and smartly executed comedy revolving around dumb characters. I just found this film to be amusing and I had a smirking or chuckling most of the way through the first time I saw it. Ben Still is actually really good at making these comedic movies. So the movie is revolves around a very exaggerated male modeling. With most of the humor coming from mocking models and the modeling career. How models are dumb and so superficial, which can actually offend some real models out there if they don\\'t have a sense of humor about it. But than again, there are plenty of movies that bash on handicap people and overweight people. Where it has that it\\'s funny cause he or she is fat kind of ordeal. But in this, it\\'s funny cause he is so dumb and lack common sense type of humor. Which has been done many times before as well. However the way the humor connects so well with each scenario is what makes this movie really work as a comedy. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the first time around and I am currently looking forward to the sequel.9/10\"', '\"I was hoping that this movie would be just outrageously funny, but fearful that it would be mostly flat, with a few good jokes, and that\\'s it.  Well, without discussing the jokes, there were only a couple of them that really got me good.  Far too few to justify even a suggestion that you watch it.  I enjoyed my time at the theater when I went to go see the movie, but the people I was sitting around were cracking better comments than the movie itself, and without them, I know I would have been bored.\"', '\"There is a telling scene in \\'Bridget Jones\\' Diary\\', when the heroine\\'s errant mother comes home to a husband dazed and directionless having been abandoned.  Colin Jones has been set up as a model of dull decency on a par with Mark Darcy, and suggestive of why Bridget should prefer the latter\\'s dogged solidity to Daniel Cleaver\\'s caddish, fun, sexually explosive flibbertigibbet.  Mum begs Dad to take her back, apologising for what she has done.  Colin pauses and says he\\'s not sure.  Mum bursts into tears, before Colin laughs, hugs her and says he was only joking.  good old dad. \\nHe waited until she had debased herself as low as she could go, until she was grovelling, had ceded any power (the great lack that decided her adultery) and independence to him as he restores his self-dignity.  It doesn\\'t matter that he has treated her as a non-person for years, never mind not condescended to conubial favours.  There is a steely cruelty in this rare gentleman, and the scene is revealing about why Bridget has ended up as she has; what she wants; and a possible fate in store for her if she chooses Mark.people have complained that a film of this title has largely forsaken the diary format.  This is not just a tired question of fidelity to text - by writing her life, Bridget takes control, shapes and interprets a seemingly chaotic, random, and failed existence.  In a film where she is an objective player, if still the main one, she is likely to lose even this mediating power.  But the film we have here is not an \\'objective\\', third-person story about a woman called Bridget Jones.  Everything in the film is filtered through her subjectivity - every pleasure and humiliation made to seem better or worse that it is because SHE experiences it.  In this way traumas like Salman Rushdie\\'s ordeal, the racist treatment of refugees in Britain etc. all become reflections of Bridget\\'s ego.  Cleverly, the film inverts the traditional male focus of Hollywood narrative.  Normally it is the man who is given the choice between two types of women, the \\'bad\\', sexually active one, and the good, more \\'spiritual\\' one.  Here it is the men who are types - and reduced to their types so they seem caricatures - and Bridget\\'s sensibility  which is whole and coherent. \\nTraditionally it is the male who seeks a good woman who will take him in hand, in effect mother him; as I have suggested, Bridget\\'s uselessness at \\'traditional\\' \\'feminine\\' tasks (cooking etc.) means she needs a father figure; similarly, it is she who forces the resolution, who chases the love object, not the man.  Just as Bridget in the book fixes a messy life, so it sit the film heroine\\'s desires and goals that shape hers.Ideological qualms aside (can\\'t we see other Britains on film? etc.), \\'Diary\\' is rather fun.  Quite why any woman would want to exchange a funny, charming, articulate rascal for a mumbling plank I don\\'t know, but I am assured by friends that I am wrong, and that Colin Firth is swoonsome.  If you\\'re looking for cinematic ingenuity, thematic density, an original story, or visual pleasure look elsewhere (Edward Yang, for instance...); if you want an amiable, undemanding film that passes the time, with cosy jokes and an excellent street brawl (loved it when caddish Cleaver fights back with a bin lid), than here you are.  Renee Zellweger is, for once, hugely sympathetic, not just for being winningly game - complaints about being too \\'posh\\' miss the crucial point that she is only posh in public situations, as befits a work based on Jane Austen.\"', '\"This just proves that movies can be great as well as good earners without having violence and vulgarity. This movie is straight up clean fun from start to finish. What a great script. I was laughing the whole way through. DeNiro as the tough guy/comedy character is great, even better than it was in \"Analyze This.\" I wonder if he\\'s going to revert to those types of roles now. It\\'s great to see such diversity in what he can play. He didn\\'t even need to say anything, just holding up a cat called Mr. Jinx and puckering at it is enough to make any grown man cry from laughter. Stiller is at his best here as well, combining his Jewishness with a clutzy attitude makes for a hysterical combination. I\\'m glad he stayed away from all those Jewish family/mother jokes because they seem to be getting old. Great showing from the girl who played Stiller\\'s fiance (can\\'t remember her name right now). She\\'s the one who added a touch of drama and romance to finish up the package. All in all, a great movie.\"', '\"Great classic movie dont know why is movie is so underrated\"', '\"After having seen such movies as the likes of \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" and \"Scream\", I\\'d just like to say this...weren\\'t they already parodies of the whole horror film genre?  If so, that would make \"Scary Movie\" a parody of a parody.  Clever.\"', '\"I loved the books this was based on and could not wait to see the film.  I now own the dvd.  Movies never are as good as the books, but this one stands on its own.  The casting was terrific.  Bridget\\'s parents are funnier in the movie than in the book.  This is one of my top ten favorite movies or I wouldn\\'t own it.  Good cure for depression gals.\"', '\"Ben Stiller just does not come across well as an earnestgood guy. At least the way he portrays himself in this movie.De Niro is good except when he drops out of character towards the end.Some solid chuckles though.\"', '\"There are two kinds of audiences to this movie: those who have seen the Scream trilogy and those who haven\\'t.The second group will think: \"What the hell was this sh**?\"The first mentioned group will be rolling on the floor laughing!Thank God I\\'m one of the first group. Scary Movie mocks about EVERYTHING that happened in Scream 1 - 3, and in such a twisted way that you cannot help but to laugh your a** off! Just take a look at the names: Neve Campbell\\'s character Sidney Prescott becomes \\'Cindy (notice the exchanged \\'d\\' and \\'n\\'?) Campbell\\'. Hilarious! And it goes on like that.For those who haven\\'t seen it yet, I would say it is making fun of the following movies: 90% Scream 1-3, 7% I know what you did last summer, 1% Blair witch project, 1% American Pie and 1% Matrix - even though that seems off-topic, but you just has to love it when you see the parallels.Oh yes, of those 90% Scream I\\'d divide it as follows: Scream 1: 75%, Scream 2: 20%, Scream 3: 5%. And I really liked it that way!And, again, the warning to all German spectators: Go to your local video store and rent all three Scream movies in English! Then visit a theater/cinema near you that shows the films with the original language. Under NO circumstances you should watch either in the German dubbed version!\"', '\"In structural terms, BRIDGET JONES DIARY doesn\\'t have too much relationship to its source; the diary-form is soon abandoned in favor of the basic romantic comic plot. What the film does have, however, is a winning central performance from Renee Zellweger in the eponymous title role; many of her thoughts are heard in voice-over, and director Sharon Maguire has great fun exploring the distance between such thoughts and what really happens in Bridget\\'s life. In many ways she is an idealist, perpetually in search of the ideal boyfriend but doomed to spend her life with lowlifes and/or cads. As Daniel Cleaver, her boss and one-time lover, Hugh Grant is a perfect example of this latter kind of person, the guy who protests love for Bridget on the one hand while trying his best to exploit her credulity on the other. The film also brings out the story\\'s Austenian echoes; Colin Firth is wonderfully standoffish as Mark Darcy, but he understand his true nature from the way he stares at Bridget, even though he moves scarcely a facial muscle. Proud of his public image as a hotshot lawyer, he finds it difficult, if not impossible to acknowledge his true feelings - at least until the climactic fight sequence with Cleaver. BRIDGET JONES DIARY also contains at least two memorable cameos from Gemma Jones as Bridget\\'s mother - whose antics put her daughter to shame - and Paul Brooke as Mr. Fitzberbert (or Tits Pervert as Bridget calls him), Cleaver\\'s snobbish sidekick. In short, a film that improves with repeated viewings.\"', '\"A simple comedy, maybe its original, maybe its not. But it\\'s excellent humor and decent acting has something every moviegoer can enjoy.\"', '\"Robert De Niro proves he is as great a comic actor as a dramatic one. Ben Stiller is at his best. Their interaction is terrific. Everyone in the theater I saw this in was probably of the same mind, as we were one in laughter. A must see.\"', '\"This is exactly what one can expect from a parody of horror movies. All kind of jokes (plain dumb to clever ones), familiar scenes and lines, continuous references to other films. I can\\'t see why one would consider this a let down. The crew themselves don\\'t take the movie seriously and this makes it better. A good suggestion for a good laugh, when you need one.\"', '\"Scary Movie is the type of movie that attracts the teen audiance.  This movie features crude sexual humor, profanity, drug use and violence.  Scary Movie has a runtime of 88 min. The movie has a weak plot and slapstic humor, half way through the movie the humor dies out and stops being funny.  It spoofs scenes from movies like the Matrix, Usual Suspects, Romeo Must Die, Scream pt1 and scream pt2.  Overall the movie is good, I gave it an 8/10\"', '\"I thought this film was alright.... not much more....The plot is pretty mental and elaborate: male models are behind all the major assassinations that have taken place!

We\\'re told that it\\'s because she so \"natural\" that she has men buzzing around her. Well, that might be true if Miss Zellweger looked more like Carole Lombard. In fact, one could easily see this as a screwball comedy back in the \\'30s if Hollywood made the story starring Lombard, Cary Grant (not Colin Firth) and James Stewart (not Hugh Grant). Get my drift? Instead, Miss Zellweger looks more like pudgy Lynn Redgrave of \"Georgy Girl,\" an overweight and rather awkward young woman given to wearing tight clothing and making the most inappropriate remarks at the most crucial moments. She speaks her mind without any regard for the consequences and lands into one troublesome social situation after another because of her quirky attitude.An inside joke has COLIN FIRTH\\'s character called Mr. Darcy--and indeed, he behaves as that gentleman did in \"Pride and Prejudice,\" at first utterly rejecting Bridget Jones and then making a pass at her which she turns down, only to change her mind before the final reel.HUGH GRANT has a thankless role as a witless cad but plays it with his usual charm, the sort of role James Stewart might have done had this been made back in Hollywood\\'s Golden Age when screwball comedy was just as mad but a lot less risquÃ©.But Renee, Colin and Hugh are not Lombard, Grant or Stewart and the film suffers because none of them can make this kind of material seem like anything more than a manipulative romantic comedy about an awkward girl finding her Prince Charming in a Jane Austen kind of way--with all the modern sensibilities destroying most of the charm.Unless you\\'re a devoted fan of these stars, this one is pretty hard to recommend except as very lightweight entertainment in quirky British style, but Bridget\\'s gaffes are too monumental to be accepted by Darcy.\"', '\"First,i\\'d like to apologize about my bad English,i\\'m not American.Now the review,people will disagree,but,this is one of the funniest movies i ever seen.Warning:If you like political correctness,this movie is totally not for you,it goes from suicide jokes to ejaculation jokes,it has lots of sex jokes,some are unfunny and kinda gross,but,are compensate by how other jokes are hilarious. Now,\"Scary Movie\" parodies slasher teen movies,mainly,\"Scream\" and \"i know what you did last summer\",but,take jabs at other films even \"matrix\".So the film synopsis is the same than from \"Scream\" and \"IKWYDLS\",only adding stupid,because it is a stupid version of these films.Sinopsis:stupid teens accidentally kill a man,one year later,these teens are chased by a stupid killer.See?Now,despite being one of the funniest movies i ever seen,it still has it bad moments,i mean,even naked gun has bad moments.One of the problems is after a while,the movie loses it steam,and the jokes get bad (those are probably the Seltzer- Friedberg parts of the script) but still it\\'s a very funny movie and i recommend to everyone who likes stupidity and spoofs,even those who don\\'t like may enjoy it\"', '\"It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve seen a movie that had me laughing through almost the entire thing.

So you know what that means-` I see rich people.\\' That would be Miramax clan who invested a few bucks on this big hit! *** Average\"', '\"I am amazed at the glowing endorsements this film has garnered here on the IMDB.  It is, quite simply, not a good movie.  The characters are extremely thin, though some of them manage to impress (like the dental assistant). \\nThe script is a disaster.  I\\'d lay odds that if you read the script, you\\'d find very few jokes.  It\\'s as if the writer was just writing down whatever came to mind and thought \"When Matthew Perry says it, it\\'ll be funny.\" Friends is not the best sitcom on TV, but it has much better writing than this movie.None of the acting was impressive at all.  Bruce Willis was nicely understated, but he can\\'t be said to have accomplished much, because he had so little to work with.  The plot was contrived, the romance angle was laughable!!  Not funny, but pathetic.  The couples meet, have sex, fall in love, and get married in the space of, what, couple days at the most. Extremely poor, in my opinion.It\\'s a cute little movie to watch on video with your girlfriend on a rainy night.  But do not shell out hard money for this dreck!\"', '\"Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock) is an FBI Agent who is somewhat lacking in feminine qualities, when the Miss United States Beauty Pageant is under threat from a killer; she is entered into the contest as Miss New Jersey and Victor Melling (Michael Caine) an expert at create winners is charged with making Miss Hart a Miss United States Contender.Sandra Bullock transforms completely into the beauty that she really is, but not without plenty of mishaps and giggles along the way. All the cast pitch in with good performances to help make Miss Congeniality a pretty fun film, that never becomes too sappy or sickly, and it actually is good entertainment.7/10\"', '\"I\\'m not a fan of spoofs, I do not like any of the Naked Gun films or Spy hard. The only two spoofs I like are the The Spy who Shagged Me and this one. This one (Scary Movie) is really pretty good. It has some real big fat laughs, where you almost spill your guts and not too many where you think: too extreme (I thought there were only two or three). That is a good thing. Plus it is pretty violent sometimes too, which I always like and the trailer did not show the best jokes at all. I actually thought after watching the trailer that this would suck be dumb, but it didn\\'t, because you get all sucked in to the films lameness. One big flaw though is, that it almost follows the original storylines of Scream and I know what you did last summer.\\n7 out of 10\"', '\"This movie had me on the floor laughing when i first saw it, i loved it! and Ben Stiller and Robert DeNeiro did such a good job in acting for it, if you havent seen it yet, go rent it, it was so funny!!!!! so go out n get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"', '\"Funny, with better, more original writing than any spoof or other comedy I remember.  First rate entertainment which keeps giving surprises which had me (and most of the audience) laughing out loud.  Keenan Wayans (director) should be feeling on top of the world!!\"', '\"Exception being, Edward Norton (Keep the Faith was a very, very good movie).This film made me cringe at points for being so egotistical. Start from the improbable beginning: a little, bespectacled girl hitting two guys. Improbable, but passable. Cut to the next scene, the same spectacles on Sandra Bullock. Oh, she is conducting a raid! How original! We just got to watch the SAME scene a couple of months ago in \"Hannibal\". So we know what will happen: she makes a mistake, she gets beaten for it, and (but of course) she gets a new assignment so that she can clear her name.Stop me if I am wrong here, but this is one of the longest chain of clichÃ©s in any movie. \"Big momma\\'s house\", \"Hannibal\", \"Pygmalion\", \"My Fair Lady\", you name it, it\\'s here.It shows who the \"Producer\" was. She never stops hogging the screen, either eating tons of ice cream (who thought that was funny), or smiling, or insulting anyone. Someone should tell Ms. Bullock that it takes a special someone to be funny and gross at the same time (think Eddie Murphy), and she is definitely not that kind of person. Her jokes are boring, her acting is only so-so, and she never stops being \"the nice one, the intelligent one, the good one\". What a bore. Furthermore, the film lacks coherence and credibility. We are supposed to be watching a \"serious\" comedy, yet when she is having her make-up applied, a megaphone blurts out: \"make up, podiatrist, dermatologist, aisle 25, urgent\", as if in a real hangar. So dumb. I agree, there are times we should check our brains at the door and just forget all about coherence, but that is usually in \"stupid\" comedies, as \"Dumb and dumber\". This film is pretentious AND dumb at the same time.Not to mention the fact that sweet Sandra Bullock transforms \"magically\" from being a brat to a beauty queen without the audience understanding what went into it. We only see her assistant, Vic (very funny performance, BTW) having trouble with her. Oh, and I won\\'t mention the fact that this should be an insult to any feminist. It really is degrading to women, considering the fact that it shows beauty contests as having something to do with intelligence. Isn\\'t this the 21st century?Overall, 6. Only because the supporting cast did make me laugh (at times).\"', '\"In real life. There is something about Meet the Parents that usually leaves you thinking \"I\\'ve lived through this before\". Everyone I saw this with could relate at one point or another with Greg, which made the humor so effective. You get to care so much about the main character because you actually feel you could have been at one time or another him.I? Well, a parent of an ex-girlfriend of mine was a criminologist. You can imagine how hard I laughed during the \"interrogation\" scene.\\nIf you have ever dated someone, you owe to yourself to watch this movie. It\\'s hilarious, and Robert de Niro and Ben Stiller won\\'t disappoint you. What a chemistry!\"', '\"I must admit this movie had some really funny moments. Scary Movie was really hysterical at times. So so funny! This was a true parody and to me, was as it should be and what I expected, a hilarious spoof on those trashy horrors we all love to hate and hate to love so much!This movie was refreshing in it\\'s sheer funniness. It\\'s not a movie to be taken seriously and it\\'s almost a roast on all the major horror movies that have been popular over the years. The movie isn\\'t deep and it sure isn\\'t for everyone, I almost think you have to moderately like, or at least have seen, many horror movies to really get into this(how would one get all the jokes otherwise either?) Basicaly, If you like parody movies and haven\\'t seen this, I suggest you go out and rent it now. Not a dull moment-and you\\'ll laugh your head off!PS:I enjoyed this much more then Scream and even though it\\'s an absolute absurd and silly movies-they can be fun sometimes. For sheer giggles, this is a great choice.\"', '\"I had heard lots of high brow rubbish before this movie, lots of \"snotty nosed\" comments on how its not a movie to \"stretch\" you etc etc etc! I\\'m sorry that these people are so far gone as not to be able to see a good light comedy in the best Hollywood traditions without enjoying it. In this movie there is a lot to enjoy, Sandra Bullock a long time favourite of mine manages to get appealling, attractive and offensive into one character (the ice cream eating scene is truly repulsive). The secondary actors fill up the spaces nicely, but, Michael Caine again proves how well he can do every type of role. But, Sandra carries the movie and does it well, long live \"Happy\" movies the world is miserable enough. 9/10\"', '\"This was a great movie for everyone who loves comedy and crime in one movie, and the casting was perfect, matthew perry and bruce willis did a great job of acting in this movie, and the plot was the greatest part of all!!!\"', '\"Greg \"Gaylord\" Focker played by Ben Stiller is a male nurse who is invited to meet is fiancÃ© to be Pam\\'s parents so that he can get their permission. However, former CIA Agent Jack Byrnes played by Robert De Niro puts Greg through a living hell before anything happens. While staying at the house he finds out that his luggage is misplace by the airport and later gets the third degree from Jack. With Jack, being a former CIA agent he uses tactics he learned to make sure that Greg is the right man for his little girl. The motif based around Greg\\'s struggles thought the whole movie. From the struggles with his luggage, the male nurse insults, to the invasive questioning from Jack. Yet being a heavy struggle for him the comedy is flowing like all movies that star Ben Stiller. Furthermore, although Jack does play sarcastic, aggressive parents there are many comic scenes that make the movie funny as well. Next, Kevin played by Owen Wilson is trying to get back Pam the girl he had lost in his past. During time that Kevin had met Greg, Kevin keeps telling Greg about the good times that him and Pam had in their past. This puts a little frustration as well as comical competition between them. Since her family is completely overwhelmed with Kevin, Greg has to go out of his way to show Pam\\'s family he is the right man her. Another one of the more comic parts of the movie is when the cat goes to the next-door neighbors but Greg thinks he is lost and tries to replace it with a stray. When the stray gets into the house the wedding dress of Pam\\'s sisters shredded by the cat, yet everyone else is at dinner. While Greg is placing calls to find out about his luggage, Jack is finding about the cat and also finding out more about Greg\\'s past. The final draw is when her family is insulting him about not becoming a doctor and his name, which is Gaylord. Whenever Jack gets the rest of the information back about Greg, after Jack finds out that everything that he said was true he feels that Greg should be placed back into his family\\'s inner circle once again. But by that time Greg is getting on the plane to head back and gets arrested by security for attacking a flight attendant and Jack has to use his CIA Agent security to get him out of trouble. Throughout this movie, there have always been struggles against Greg but the audience will laugh through every one of them.\"', '\"I enjoy a spot of lowbrow humour as much as the next guyâ€”unless the next guy happens to be a Wayans brother. In 90s slasher spoof Scary Movie, Shawn, Marlon and Keenan Ivory Wayans have created a film so infantile and so devoid of genuine humour that it is hard to believe that anyone exists with an IQ low enough to appreciate its idiocy.A crass collection of obvious lampoonery, gross-out toilet humour, sexual innuendo and uninspired visual gags, this utterly puerile effort must represent the absolute nadir of spoof movie-making (with the possible exception of the Scary Movie sequels!). Rapid fire gags about farts, fat birds, genitals, drug-use, and sex all fail to raise a laugh thanks to their predictability, whilst jokes that might have seemed topical at the time now seem extremely dated and will probably make no sense at all to many of today\\'s viewers (eg.,The Miller Time \\'Wassup?\\' skit and a Spice Girls gag).In their desperate search for cheap laughs, the Wayans Brothers also unwisely cast their net outside of the horror genre, lampooning everything from Amistad to The Matrix with material that even Leslie Nielsen in his twilight years would have left festering at the bottom of the barrel.I rate Scary Movie 3 out of 10: one point for the delightful Anna Faris as winsome heroine Cindy Campbell, and another point each for the ample curves of Carmen Electra and Shannon Elizabeth (it\\'s always nice to have something good to look at when a film sucks so hard!).\"', '\"This was a very funny movie and I\\'ve heard a lot from people that they didn\\'t like it because it was stupid. Well stupid is funny, seeing people go up there and make idiots of themselves is what makes a lot of people laugh and the Wayans brothers did just that. I liked this movie a lot and if they make another sequel, I\\'ll be there.\"', '\"I\\'d heard this was supposed to be a good spoof on horror films.What a major disappointment.  Bad acting, bad timing, lots of farting and sexual innuendo--must have narrowly missed being classified as NC-17.Should have been thrown in the cutting room trash can.I almost walked out 3 three times but thought, surely my eyes deceive me. This can not be happening. At 88 minutes it is 85 minutes too long.YECH!!\"', '\"I think that the storyline of this movie was really weak. There was nothing new in the type of story that was told. Good cop against bad criminal, male cop against female cop. A movie with a really happy ending. Criminal gets caught and there\\'s the ever expected love romance between de male and female cop. But the humor in this movie really made me love it. I just couldn\\'t stop laughing.\"', '\"On the inside of Meet the Parents is a great plot idea, struggling to get out. Actually, that\\'s not strictly true - the plot is actually realized pretty well; it\\'s the supposed timing and unrelenting nature of the events that, for me, make this film no better than mediocre.The premise is simple: About to propose to Pam (Teri Polo), his girlfriend, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) realises he\\'s expected to ask her father\\'s permission first. Of course, Jack (Robert de Niro) turns out to be every suitor\\'s worst nightmare: demanding, condescending, belittling. Worse, it seems Greg can do nothing right.The bulk of the film documents everything that happens over a weekend at the parental home. Pam\\'s sister is getting married, so it\\'s a big get-together with family and friends. The battering starts immediately; Greg\\'s luggage goes missing. Jack makes snide comments over the colour of his rental car and choice in pets. Greg even causes chaos when opening a bottle of wine.He is mocked for his choice of career - he\\'s a nurse. Guess what: half the guests are doctors. He\\'s intimidated by Pam\\'s previous boyfriend, the seemingly perfect Kevin (Owen Wilson). His surname makes him an easy target. He manages to lose the family\\'s pet cat, so he buys a replacement which looks nearly identical - which promptly tears the wedding dress to shreds. His luggage turns up, and Jack searches it, finding a pile of women\\'s clothes - because, of course, it\\'s not his bag.It transpires that Jack is a former CIA agent - except Greg becomes convinced he\\'s still involved in some covert operation. So he blurts out what he knows - and, wouldn\\'t you just know it, he\\'s put his foot in it again.Taken individually, each incident is at least passably funny; some are hilarious; some make you cringe on Greg\\'s behalf. But it\\'s the whole thing - the relentless progression from one minor disaster to the next - where I felt the movie fell down. At first, it\\'s pretty funny, watching this guy make a complete fool of himself; but when it goes on and on, and you realize you\\'re in for an hour where nothing, NOTHING goes right, it just gets depressingly tedious.And it\\'s not all perfect. The surname gag grew old fairly quickly; the way people addressed him using only his surname was downright rude rather than funny; one leaking toilet would NOT flood a yard, no matter how full the septic tank (and what kind of planning is it to hold a big wedding party with the tank ready to blow?) The happy ending was also pretty unconvincing.I haven\\'t really said anything about the performances. I felt everyone did a reasonable job, nobody excelled. de Niro *can* do comedy - Brazil, Midnight Run - but here, I thought he was too deadpan, and the role just a bit *too* psycho. Stiller was a good choice for the lead, and Owen Wilson is great as the all-too-perfect ex. But, as I said, it\\'s the pacing that spoils things. If they had spread the pain out a little - shown meetings over several weekends - along with scaling it back a little, I\\'d have enjoyed it a lot more.\"', '\"Now all you pro Sandra Bullock people calm down, I haven\\'t anything against Miss Bullock but have you seen The Net and Speed 2 they Suck big time!. Well I\\'m glad to report this put Sandra back on track and deserving the paycheck. What a movie, hilarious and actually well plotted. I went to this with a friend and didn\\'t expect much, come on now a movie about a FBI agent going undercover as a Miss America, how lame is that. But WAIT! the scripts good the acting is cool and the jokes are actually funny! Whoa!. One for us blokes with the stunning Sandra Bullock and the rest of the female cast. One for the girls in the chick flick genre. I actually came out of this movie over two hours ago and I still smile at the thought of some of the gags. Michael Caine surprises us with the gay trainer hamming it up to a limit unexpected of the guy thats been in Get Carter and The Italian Job. Go see this movie if you want to smile. Top Class!.\"', '\"Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock) is a tough-as nails FBI agent, quite capable in her field but lacking everywhere else. When a mission goes awry, she is forced to go undercover as a contestant in Miss United States Beauty Pageant in order to prove her worth. Now this is especially difficult for those cops(in this case Gracie) who lacks all \"feminine graces.\"Here Gracie is not one of those \\'cool\\' cops who can pin her hair with one hand and stab the enemy with the other. She is the one who can match her male colleagues in boxing, makes witty comments, wears baggy jeans, cannot manage her unruly hair, cannot walk in heels, chews loudly, and snorts when she laughs. Sandra Bullock is effortlessly good as Gracie and steals the show with her over-the top antics. She provides all the laughs in the movie.As for the story line, well, it is not as amazing as Sandra. It is pretty entertaining to watch her. You can overlook the story line when she comes on screen.Rating: 6.5/10\"', '\"Another stupid comedy with pointless jokes.I had some expectations for this movie because I thought that the \"scream trilogy\" and \"I know what you did last summer\" were terrible  but...this is really bad.Don\\'t spend your money on this garbage.\"', '\"I saw Scary Movie expecting to see some better gross-out jokes than in both There\\'s Something About Mary and American Pie. After seeing the preview, I expected that I was going to leave the theater holding my sides, and with my cheeks aching from laughing so hard. What I got was an hour and a half of the exact same jokes that I had already seen in the previews, with a few disgusting and boring sex jokes. The spoofs were put in almost verbatim from such films as the Scream trilogy (obviously), Urban Legend, I Know What You Did Last Summer, the Matrix, and even the Usual Suspects for some odd reason. Because of that, what you get is not a film that stands on its own, but a conglomeration of skits based on the above horror films. Watching Scary Movie is almost like watching a sick version of a Saturday Night Live-type TV show. While I was watching Scary Movie, I found myself laughing at the jokes almost entirely because I WANTED it to be funny, but then I found myself feeling stupid for laughing out loud at something that was not even remotely amusing. This truly is a terrible film, and I can\\'t say that I recommend it to ANYONE.\"', '\"It\\'s an amusing romantic comedy with RenÃ©e Zellweger is a plumpish woman on and after her thirty-second birthday. She\\'s single and nothing much is going on. She seems cheerful enough about it all but she decides to begin life anew, starting a diary and making resolutions such as losing fourteen pounds and cutting down on the drinking and smoking.Zellweger works in a London publishing house and begins to wear short skirts and rather vulgar see-through blouses to the office. Soon enough she\\'s flirting with her boss, the ever sly Hugh Jackman, and soon after than they\\'re in the sack together. She begins to get a bit mushy and asks him if he loves her. For that, he buggers her for the second time.Well -- does he love her? Is he willing to \"commit\"? (That\\'s code for \"willing to get married.\") Evidently not, because she pays him an unexpected visit one day and finds a luscious babe naked in his bath room. The babe eyes Zellweger with a smirk and remarks, \"I thought you said she was THIN.\" Ouch.Meanwhile, always hovering around the background, is the successful but stuffy and decidedly unchic Colin Firth. Zellweger has loathed him at first sight. He never smiles or flirt or jokes around like the roguish Jackman. Not much fun, you know. But one day he takes her aside and tells her grimly that he \"likes her\" just the way she is. Coming from him, that\\'s a Niagara Falls of a confession. In the meantime, though, Jackman has abandoned all his girl friends and tells Zellweger she can give him rebirth. That is, he\\'s now willing to get married and so, it develops, is Firth.At a dinner one night at Zellweger\\'s flat, Jackman and Firth run into one another and have a fist fight over her. Now this has got to be female fantasy Number One -- two men fighting over you, a plain girl with not much going for her but brains and zest. And they\\'re both successful and have other women salivating over them. Wow. I won\\'t claim it began with Jane Austen\\'s \"Pride and Prejudice\" because I\\'m sure the theme goes back in history through the Greek masques, and is lost finally in the mists of antiquity. (For men\\'s fantasy Number One, viz., The Conquering Hero. Start with \"Rocky.\" Go back to \"The Iliad.\") Much of the wit lies in the writing itself, full of irony and vulgarity. There are a few slapstick scenes -- Bridget trying to cook -- that hark back to \"I Love Lucy\" and Laurel and Hardy. They\\'re still funny and the absurd characters are well defined.Zellweger is a decent actress and though hefty she has an engaging blue eyes and a smile that could brighten a room. Jackman is his usual on-screen self, stuttering slightly, a little embarrassed at times. Firth is unpleasant and stiff but Zellweger has juice enough for both of them and she\\'ll turn him into a paragon of Ã©lan before you know it.\"', '\"This was by far the funniest movie I have ever seen. It was extremely well-acted and absolutely hilarious. Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller had such a good chemistry and both of them know how to portray a vast amount of characters. Watch for scenes with the cat. Newcomer Nicole DeHuff does a good job in her role also. Go see Meet The Parents! And if you already have, go see it again! 10/10\"', '\"Helen Fielding originally started writing the leading fictional character\\'s scribbling as articles for The Independent, this was later fully published and became the biggest selling book of the 1990s, so it was only right for her and rom-com writer Richard Curtis (Blackadder, The Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill) to team up and bring her to the big screen. Basically Bridget Jones (Oscar BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated RenÃ©e Zellweger) is an average woman living in London who works in an office, has issues with her weight, smokes and drinks, has many imperfections, and is single. Following New Year, to take control of her life, Bridget decides to start a diary, to tell the complete truth, to try and change her habits, to lose weight and stop smoking, and express her true feelings about her job, her family and friends, and of course her pursuit to find the right man. Bridget works in publicity at a book publishing company, and fantasises about her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), one day he starts to flirt with her, and soon enough they embark on a relationship. Bridget has fallen head over heels for Daniel, but his feelings are not reciprocated, she discovers he is a womaniser, and he even becomes engaged to another woman, she quits her job at the publishing office and eventually finds work in television journalism. Bridget on many occasions encounters barrister Mark Darcy (BAFTA nominated Colin Firth), he is good looking, but she cannot stand him, she also assumes he is already dating colleague Natasha (Matilda\\'s Embeth Davidtz), but he surprises her at event by confessing that he likes her. Bridget celebrates her birthday, inviting her friends round for dinner, only to cause chaos with her cooking skills, Mark is there to support and show affection for her, a drunken Daniel also shows up, assuming she was alone, Mark and he step outside and have a fight, Mark wins but is shunned away, while Daniel is rejected by Bridget. Meanwhile, Bridget\\'s mother Pamela (Gemma Jones) has left Bridget\\'s father Colin (Jim Broadbent) and started an affair with shopping channel presenter Julian (Patrick Barlow), they do reconcile, and Bridget\\'s mother reveals a truth, Bridget assumed it was Mark who had an affair with Daniel\\'s wife, in fact it is the other way around. Bridget at the Darcys\\' ruby wedding anniversary party she wants to confess her feelings for Mark, but she is devastated to find out that he and Natasha have accepted jobs in New York, but Bridget speaks out about how England will be losing a good man like Mark, her words obviously have an effect on him, but he stills travels to America. At Christmas time, Bridget\\'s friends invite her to join them on a trip to Paris, France to forget all about Mark, but he surprises her showing up at her flat, they kiss for the first time, there is a moment when she assumes he leaves, after reading about her hatred for him in her diary, but they embrace in the snow after he explains he was buying her a new diary, to start the New Year.

Zellweger does an impeccable British accent and is adorable as the 30-somthing heroine who gets herself into embarrassing situations but you root for, Firth is very likable as the good looking uptight lawyer, and Grant is splendid and escapes the posh twit persona seen previously to becomes a caddish bastard. All the acting by the ensemble cast of stellar Brits is great, the script is witty, daftly funny, hilariously cringy and suitably sweet, and the pop music soundtrack, including \"Out of Reach\" by Gabrielle and \"Have You Met Miss Jones?\" by Robbie Williams is great, it just has all the right ingredients, a brilliant romantic comedy. It was nominated the BAFTA Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and Best Adapted Screenplay, it was nominated the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical.

How no-one works out Big Momma is a man dressed up had me beat. There were plenty of times where he was hugged, touched etc where people would think \"hey, that felt cushiony\". Anyways, the film revolves around Martin Lawrence pretending to be an Aunt of a woman and her son trying to escape from her dodgy boyfriend.The cops find out she\\'s planning on staying at her Aunt\\'s, so they dress up Martin Lawrence as \"Big Momma\" and hope to find out some info that will lead them to the gangsters.

Unfortunately, I only laughed once during the whole movie. Seeing a bad attempt at parody such as this only makes one respect Airplane and Naked Gun all the more. Avoid this gross, strained \"comedy.\" A 1 out of 10.\"', '\"Way back in the early 80s, when Airplane and the like films came out, they had no intention of having a plot, and Scary Movie remembers that.  What we do get is a no holds barred parody of the recent rash of teen horror flick that have come out in the last few years.  Scream, The Sixth Sense, I Know What you did Last Summer, and the Matrix among others all are given an ol\\' punch in the guts through this film.  The plot, which is very thin, is used only to keep the gags running along.  But who cares?  This film is very much aware it is a movie, and takes good advantage of it, with the gags coming along a mile a minute.  Scary Movie is meant to be silly, and it pulls more jokes off more than it misses.  I found myself laughing heartily at this film, along with the majority of theater.  From the amazingly hilarious opening sequence, which features the ravishingly beautiful Carmen Electra, to it\\'s subtle gags involving the facial expressions of the killer\\'s mask, Scary Movie is non-stop laughter from the beginning to the end.  Parent\\'s beware, how this movie avoided the NC17 rating, I\\'ll never know, and frankly I don\\'t care.  Well worth the price of admission at any cost!!!!\"', '\"The movie is based on Helen Fielding\\'s novel, but the story-line is nothing novel, and in fact reminiscent of Picture Perfect. But the focus here is on the spinsterhood of the sulking heroine. The plot gives ample scope for humour and it is exploited fully by the cast and crew. The difference is that the movie is set in the UK and hence accomplishes a unique marriage of British humour and Hollywood film-making.\\nZellweger does her role to perfection in all aspects, while the others are adequate. Grant takes a break from his \"nice guy\" stereotype. The soundtrack might be worth buying. You can be assured of a good time if you don\\'t expect too much of the usual mushy stuff. Don\\'t bother about the diary; it\\'s there just to keep things interesting.\"', '\"This movie made me want to frolic around with my good friends and splash them with gasoline!!!  Don\\'t know what I\\'m talking about GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  If you\\'re a gen Xer that grew up under the MTV culture there is so much in this movie that you will appreciate.HANSEL ROCKS!!!\"', '\"Scary Movie was a hilarious movie that spoofs off many popular horror movies...it was genius.. Making spoof movies are extremely difficult because you have to make it funny enough so everyone will enjoy it..that\\'s not easy. Everyone has different tastes and most likely people wont like it. Scary Movie achieves to deliver to many people...more than i thought. Its very crude but its still awesomely done. It was hilarious but also stupid. It\\'s a great comedy!! I recommend this for moviegoers who want to laugh. I was amazed by the reviews for this film because spoof movies tend to not really succeed. But this got many positive reviews. Kudos to Shawn and Marlon Wayans. They made a very enjoyable spoof movie to be enjoyed for many years.\"', '\"\"Scary Movie\" is, by far, the worst movie I have ever seen.  There were so many disgusting scenes that were just not funny.  While \"Something About Mary\" was not my favorite movie, at least \"Mary\" had some redeeming qualities.  I hid in the theater after watching \"Scary Movie\" until most patrons had left because I didn\\'t want anyone to see that I had just seen that trash.  I did see someone I knew in the theater, noticed her laughing, and now I think a lot less of her.I had the overwhelming feeling that I needed a shower after watching \"Scary Movie\".  It was just so disgusting.This is gross-out humor at its worst.  Trying so hard to go \"over the top\" that no thought is put into any other aspect of the movie.\"', '\"i was asking me this question all time long since i have made the mistake to go in this movie. it was from the beginning the one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life. not that i had great expectations, the movie on its own was bad enough to fullfit this place in my movie-stats. i can understand that the character of zoolander is good enough to be part of a fashion-award-show and also good enough for some jokes but it is definitly not enough to make a movie of it. i supose the studios gave stiller the money for this movie without reading the script. but i`ve been strong. i`ve waited to the end to build up my meaning about this movie. honestly i hoped the movie could become a little better but it hasnt. the movie is made for idiots by idiots, cause a healthy mind couldn`t have made this rubbish.\"', '\"Gosh, this is the worst kind of movies. Vulgar jokes, bad acting, I barely laughed at this movie, and I guess that in a few years, when I see it again, I will probably lower the rating from 2 to 1. Because this is horrible. The only people that gives this movies a good rating is probably the same ones rating Epic Movie as the greatest movie of all time, and I can understand the teenagers that in their age might think this i fun, and a great movie. It isn\\'t! I can\\'t come up with one good thing about this movie, and I was really considering giving it 1, but to be nice, I decided to let it get a 2, because, I can\\'t actually refuse to laugh one or two times during the movie, how bad and disgusting the jokes are, I guess I still have got a bit of that childish humor left, but as I have already written, when I get older, I will probably give Scary Movie the rating 1. I\\'ve heard they\\'re planning a Scary Movie 5... Please don\\'t. Just try to pretend that these four Scary Movies were never made, so we might forget them in the future.\"', '\"What a terrific film. Brilliant. I don\\'t know how mister Stiller did this, but that\\'s it and that\\'s all. Forget about Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Godfather, Rear Window, forget them. Forget contemporary classics like Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight, There Will Be Blood, Memento. Ben Stiller did the greatest film of all times here, without a shadow of doubt. Saying otherwise means that you suffered a brainwash, even more evilesque than the one Zoolander suffered. In fact, Will Ferrell dancing and yelling \\'kill the Malaysian leader!\\' with a blue background would look like a good dream, compared with the brainwash you suffered. Even more, dare I say.This film, vastly underrated, deserves at least one Oscar by year only for homages. Ben Stiller deserved the Nobel for Human Sciences here, and also a Nobel of literature, obviously by helping to create a script that could easily beat any book created by Freud, Dostoyevsky or Shakespeare. He deserves. I am afraid that I\\'m going to watch Zoolander for the rest of my life, because there is no piece of cinema made before, after or whats ever worth watching after that. Bravo! A film that for once, made me feel like a genius!\"', '\"This film is quite simply the finest comedy to come out of the US this century. That\\'s why it flopped there. Tut tut. Stiller and Wilson do the original buddy stuff, playing out their ridiculous male models to perfection, whilst the supporting cast are sensational. Jon Voight as Derek\\'s New Jersey coal mining father (you\\'re dead to me boy, more dead to me than your dead mother), Will Ferrel\\'s bizarre but hilarious fashion designer Jacobin Mugatu, creator of the piano key neck tie (obey my dog!) and Jerry Stiller\\'s track-suited, dwarfish agent lothario with serious renal problems (ah, my prostate\\'s flared up like a honeydew) all combine to make a film with barely a laugh-free second. Oh, and David Bowie\\'s in it. I think, in all fairness, it\\'s a case of either getting it or not. Personally, I find a poodle in a wig, pointless celebrity cameos and the phrase orange-mocha-frappucino pant-wettingly funny. If you don\\'t then please leave now and go watch Starsky and Hutch like all the other cool kids. But know this: you are a big fat faker. Put a cork in it Zane!\"', '\"This is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. Even my children (whom I assume it was aimed at) didn\\'t like it.Whoever is advising Sandra Bullock on her choice of scripts needs changing pdq! As good as she was in The Net, 28 Days and A Time to Kill, she is equally ill suited for this film and role.\"', '\"8 August 2010. What is difficult to determine is whether it\\'s Matthew Perry, from FRIENDS (1994-2004) or Mitchell Kapner, the writer of the movie that makes the comedy mesh so well, from the physical gags that seem to be pretty lame but are artfully presented on screen so that they are fresh and really funny. This is a predictable comedy, mystery, crime thriller that still is able to shake and twist its premise into something interesting and sufficiently new that it makes the movie entertaining, hilarious, and decently above the average comedy movie. Natasha Henstridge from SPECIES (1995) has the elegance and style to carry off her serious character while the rest of the supporting cast along with Bruce Willis add that sure and charismatic charm of a solid romantic comedy. While this movie doesn\\'t shake the roof off, present a classic, new bold award-winning combination, it is layered enough with a captivating plot with a dash of substance (the test of love) and performances that it makes for a really nice experience, in other words, a good time.\"', '\"Went into this movie not expecting a lot from it. But I was pleasantly surprised. It\\'s not a cerebral comedy by any stretch of the imagination, but good in a slapstick kind of way. Reminded me of a modern version of Charlie Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy, or the Three Stooges: a guy completely in over his head, completely out of his league. There were some good site gags that many people may not have noticed about this movie, like the fact that this guy is driving a Toyota Corolla, and not something fancy. Some people have noted that Rosanna Arquette as Matthew Perry\\'s bitchy french Canadian wife had a horrible accent, and badly acted, but I think that was deliberate, it just added to the slapstick. I also found it amusing that they didn\\'t try to hide the fact that they were in Montreal, and not try to pass it off as New York or some other American city, because it was important to some of the gags about Canadian vs. American tastes. A lot of so-called American movies are filmed in Canada these days, and they always try to pass off our cities as some American city rather than as themselves: good touch. And watch the Keystone Cops they were hilarious.\"', '\"This film is a very comedic film made me very happy thank all the workers in this film deserve the 10 stars and more\"', '\"Okay, you know those ladies nights? Whether it\\'s just you alone, chilling with a bowl of popcorn, or it\\'s you and your sisters or your neighbor or your mom or your aunt or your cousin, this movie is perfect for a night in and a good laugh.The jokes are timeless and hilarious, the romance is predictable (but I see nothing wrong with that if it\\'s done well) and the bond the main women form on screen is brilliant. 100% recommend.\"', '\"\"Miss Congeniality is a gem. Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite current actresses and really comes through as the klutzy tomboy FBI agent who is entered into a beauty pageant. Beauty pageants are fertile ground for satire and slapstick, and the creators and actors don\\'t let anything get by them. The cast is great, from Ernie Hudson as Gracie\\'s boss, Michael Caine as her coach, Benjamin Bratt as her love interest, Candice Bergen as the pageant head honcho, William Shatner as the pompous pageant emcee, and the actresses who play the contestants. One nice touch is that they didn\\'t make the contestants either bubbleheads or mean self-centered brats, which would have been the easy way out. There are plenty of laughs as Gracie tries to learn to be a beauty pageant lady instead of a rough and tumble FBI agent.\"', '\"Ok people, time to start looking to deep into this movie and laugh at it for what it is worth.  What is funny about this movie, everything!  I find it so unbelievable that HBO can run great shows like The Sopranos, Sex and the City, and Six Feet Under, and people can\\'t stop praising them, in which, they should be praised, because they are good; and then material in this movie offends them?  I haven\\'t seen anything in this movie that I hadn\\'t seen in Sex in the City that was offensive, but yet that show is a masterpiece by everyones standards.  But when a movie makes fun of other movies and throws in sexual humor, that\\'s just appalling to them.  It\\'s just a movie people, it is taking cliches, stereotypes, and making them funny! If you were embarrassed to sit among other people in a movie theater to watch this movie, you need to ask yourself are you taking life for what it\\'s worth?  This type of movie is what makes life funny, because we are able to make fun of ourselves and realize not everybody acts like this!!  People lighten up!!!! 8/10\"', '\"... literally...  My girlfriend and I walked the 7 blocks home from the local theatre and could not stop laughing.  I haven\\'t had so much fun at the movies in years.  DeNiro is absolutely fabulous.  Ben Stiller may be the saviour of the good name of young comic actors.\"', '\"I just saw a sneak preview of The Whole Nine Yards.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie--at least what I saw before the film platter fell off right at the climax (Doh!) and I was handed my free pass to another showing.  (I can\\'t wait for digital projection!)  Willis is as likeable as ever, even as a murderer (hit man) of 17 people.  Thankfully, Perry\\'s usual awkwardness is not overplayed.  Peet is adorably corny.  Henstridge is sultry.  Duncan, Williams, Arquette, and Pollak are all excellent in their supporting roles. The movie provides non-stop action and humor and is not gratuitously violent.   Now, I just have to go see the last half of the movie.\"', '\"Oh my god! I don\\'t remember seeing the most idiotic comedy in all my life. In a good way, of course. When I started to watch it, I couldn\\'t expect it so brilliant. Frat pack really do their work, making us laugh. Well, at least, make me laugh. Ben Stiller is just perfect for roles of a kind, good heart idiots,Owen is there to support as always, Christine Taylor is constantly showing that she becomes actress, not just Ben\\'s wife. Brilliant Vince Vaughn with his perfect sense of comedy rhythm, in his short appearance. But this movie has something that no movie before it. Amazing Will Ferrel as fashion magnate Mugatu, so great, with his unbelievable hair, pet, clothes, job. Makin fun of male models is something he can do just fine, along with his colleges. A must-see comedy with many celebrities like Billy Zane, Fred Durst,Stephen Dorff, David Bowie.... Mila Jovovich,of course\"', '\"Once upon a time I did enjoy this film but not I have to ask myself what was I thinking watching this film?It goes to show how some comedy films actually look better on paper but this film didn\\'t get the message because it has everything that should be ashamed of itself for.Well they try to have a serious plot with Terrence Howard playing the main villain and Martin Lawrence playing the protagonist however the film script really should have been review before ever getting a green light.Well I have to give it some decent points for trying to be creative the film just miss it mark. Some of the jokes in this film are just not that funny and it should have never been mention on film.The acting in this film is just about normal and it\\'s hard to really say he gave a good performance or not but the film just look better on paper all together.I would say watch it if you\\'re curious but other than that it\\'s just not strong to get on DVDI give Big Momma\\'s House an 5 out of 10\"', '\"This movie is painfully bad.  I ended up sitting through it just to see if there was even one scene that might make me chuckle.  Just one..... and there wasn\\'t.  It is so stupid it will make you feel ripped off even if someone walked up and gave it to you.  You will feel like you wasted 90 minutes of your life.There is not a single funny scene in the entire movie.  It centers around Ice Cube going to visit his uncle, who had recently won the lottery.  He hangs out with his moronic friend Day-Day and they try to be funny with a long series of boring, tired, done-a-million-times jokes on drugs, sex and flatulence.I cannot believe that someone who is supposed to have some talent such as Ice Cube could have written such trash.  And who in the world would have produced this film?  Why it would have to be Ice Cube himself since no one else with any sense or taste would have touched it.  This is, without doubt, the all-time worst movie ever made.  I think you should all go and rent it (was it ever in the theaters?) just to see how bad films can be. Congratulations Ice, a new low!\"', '\"This movie may have had somewhat of a weak plot (which is part of the humor in itself) but the actions of all the characters in the movie are hilarious. Ben Stiller plays a somewhat \\'dumb\\' (putting it lightly) male model. He\\'s been hypnotized to kill the prime minister of Malaysia. All the characters are great and the humor is non-stop. I laughed in the car on the way home. So go see it \"You freakin\\' idiot!\"\"', '\"Another sweet-but-painful film labelled as comedy by the marketers, in the style of British films which started with Four Weddings and a Funeral and has continued quite nicely ever since. This is by no means as good as the best of them, but is quite watchable, and shows that Renee, like Gwynneth can do a credible British accent. Its funny how the real actress now resembles what her character calls a \\'stick insect\\', which only shows she didnt take any hints from the screenplay. All the British leads are terrific, of course, and it makes for a experience that this male thought was eminently worthwhile.\"', '\"The trend in comedies is to go for the gross out gags.  Some movies do it well -- \"Dumb and Dumber\", \"Kingpin\", \"There\\'s Something About Mary\", and even \"American Pie\".  There were times in each of those that I thought, \"I can\\'t believe I actually saw that!\"  But they had me rolling at the same time.  \"Scary Movie\" had me thinking the same thing, but I didn\\'t laugh. The above movies were gross, but they were on a different level -- and they varied the content.  This movie had a handful of jokes that were played over and over and over and...\"Scary Movie\" got real tired real quick.  The first gay joke was funny. The 50th was not.  The first oral sex joke (a rip-off of  a classic Chris Elliot moment in \"Mary\") wasn\\'t funny. The 50th was offensive.  The first naked male brought a chuckle.  The next few times, I had to turn away.  Drugs and dopers were funny in \"Fast Times At Ridgemont High\", but Spicoli rarely mentioned them or was even seen with them.  His attitude and actions told it all.  Everything out of Marlon Wayans\\' mouth is cliched drug references. It bored me.The movie did have some funny moments.  Carmen Electra in Drew Barrymore\\'s role from \"Scream\" was classic.  The remake of the \"Wassup\" commercials had me.  The \"The Blair Witch Project\" spoof showed exactly what everyone who saw the movie was thinking.  I especially enjoyed the girl watching \"Shakespeare in Love\".   There were just too few of these moments.I wish that more time was spent in developing this movie.  References to the Bud commercial and \"Big Momma\\'s House\" show how recently this was thrown together.  In all, this movie had me longing for the Wayan\\'s comedy from \"In Living Color\" and \"I\\'m Gonna Get You Sucka\".  This one just sucked.\"', '\"Scary Movie is absolutely hilarious throughout the film!! It has love, TONS OF LAUGHTER, thrilling moments. Such a GREAT FILM!!! A+++ Film.\"', '\"\"Bridget Jones\\' Diary\" was one of the best movies I\\'ve seen this year.  As Bridget, Renee Zellweger was witty, with an adorably self-deprecating sense of humor.  Hugh Grant and Colin Firth (as her boss and a man she knew as a child, respectively) also did well in their roles.  It was such a funny movie, definitely a romantic comedy, but I think guys would like it, too. It was so good, in fact, that although I\\'ve already seen a free sneak preview, I would definitely pay to go see it again.\"', '\"Throughout the film, even at the end, I felt like imploring the guy, \\'run for your life! She\\'s not the one!\\' Pam\\'s neglect of Greg\\'s feelings and most of all her blindness toward her father\\'s obsessiveness demonstrates how we never see our own family the same way other people do. You know your family is weird--but just how weird is only found through throwing a stranger at its mercy.\"Parents\" begins as an overprotective-father-versus-boyfriend story, moves toward the ridiculous, but always remains believable. After a while it becomes clear that the real problem between Greg and Jack (Robert DiNiro), Pam\\'s dad, is simple: they just don\\'t get along. We\\'ve all come across people we know we don\\'t like from the moment we meet them. Greg\\'s tough luck is that his father-in-law to-be is one of these people.\"Meet The Parents\" is good because it gives each character enough of a life that each has something to learn. It\\'s also got a lot of humanity at its core. Most everyone who sees this film will be able to relate to Greg\\'s predicament. Most everyone will recall a time when they were in Greg\\'s shoes--or they\\'ll come to the shocking realization that they were torturing someone and didn\\'t know it at the time.This is a rare story in which there really is one main character around which everything else revolves. Everything that happens is connected with Greg Focker (Ben Stiller plays it perfectly; he\\'s never been funnier). There are no unnecessary subplots that enhance supporting characters. They don\\'t even bother giving Pam her own life. All she is, from first frame to last, is Greg\\'s girlfriend. Jack is Greg\\'s girlfriend\\'s dad and so on. This puts you inside the main character\\'s world in a way few films do.While the writers show great control over their material by doing this, they fall short in other areas. Greg\\'s last name, Focker, and the various ways people pronounce it, is a running gag that isn\\'t nearly as funny as the film\\'s creators seem to think it is. Whenever things start getting dull, they pull out the old Focker joke so at least the small-minded people in the audience can get a giggle. There are moments of agony, such as truck tires spraying sewage all over Pam\\'s family, that are so gross you can\\'t believe what you\\'re watching. The goal is to set this lewdness against a backdrop of suburban normalness, which makes it funnier.Supposedly anyway. More times than not, though, it works. The film does what all good entertainment does: holds a warped mirror up to real life, so we can laugh at ourselves a little.Grade: C+\"', '\"Bridget Jones Diary is a must see for all. Its really really funny, and the fact that it stars Hugh Grant and Colin Firth makes it even better. This is one of my favourite films of all time, and i can\\'t wait to see The Edge of Reason.\"', '\"After watching this movie for the first time, I was stunned.  Shaken to the core.  I instantly reached for a cigarette.  I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever identified more with a fictional character in my life.  The incredible magnitude of which was felt by all my friends and family.  It was truly scary.  I resolved to read the second book, \"The Edge of Reason\" and loved it instantly.  This is my new favorite movie.  I don\\'t know what else to say!  I give an 11 out of 10!\"', '\"This movie is a must see for anybody under the age of 30, it is hilarious....  It has some sick humor in it and it is hilarious.  The trailer does give some of the funny stuff away but there is a whole lot more to surprise you and I mean it will surprise you.  I might have to go see the movie again because everybody was laughing too loudly to hear through half of it!\"', '\"Unusual but not entirely successful feel-bad comedy. At first glance, \"Meet the Parents\" seems to be a hybrid of Blake-Edwards-style farce and uninspired mainstream movie comedy (sort of like every movie Steve Martin has made in the past 15 years). But before long we realize it\\'s actually much crueler than that Â– unlike those essentially safe entertainments, which are always rather boringly humane in their treatment of their characters, this film isn\\'t afraid to get ugly. Its poor protagonist may not be particularly likable (and Ben Stiller\\'s performance doesn\\'t help a lot where that\\'s concerned), but he nevertheless gains our sympathies because of the incessant, unreasonable series of tortures it rains down on him. It parades ugly character after ugly character in front of him, but unlike ridiculous farce figures such as Martin Short\\'s Franck in the \"Father of the Bride\" series, these people are all too believable, the kinds of smug hypocrites we encounter all too often in life (and that includes Focker\\'s fiancÃ©e, actually). That\\'s sort of where the problem comes in - the glitzy Hollywood veneer never really jells with the elements of real pain, and we never particularly want to see Stiller accepted into this family. Worse than that, the film\\'s not consistently funny, though of course it is frequently appalling, and to some that\\'s going to be close enough. 6.5 out of 10.\"', '\"Very funny dry humor and situational humor. lots of good characters (about 6 viewings)\"', '\"Comedy is Sandra Bullock\\'s place- that\\'s what MISS CONGENIALITY proves. Although Michael Caine steals many scenes (he\\'s Michael Caine, after all!), Ms. Bullock does what she does best. Her makeover is not really believable, but this is not a documentary. It\\'s a laugh riot comedy!8/10\"', '\"Really funny! Ben and Owen are awsome! Ben Stiller is so funny.! And Owen, you have got a style of your own that is so cool! I watch it all the time!  Its cool to see something new each time I watch it!\"', '\"Sure it\\'s stupid and you\\'ll let out some groans, but this movie is hilarious. I find myself watching this over and over. If you have seen the movies they spoof it makes it that much funnier. Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Usual Suspects, The Matrix. I\\'m probably missing a couple. The entire cast of Scary Movie is funny, but I do think Anna Faris makes this. While the sequels to this just go downhill more each one, Scary Movie is clever and literally had me laughing the entire movie.\"', '\"I think Ben Stiller is usually quite funny, especially in Meet the Parents (update as of 12/04: his shtick is now growing weary), but Zoolander is one of his worst. There are few funny moments that I actually laughed at. Even though Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are best buds and frequently work together in films, it didn\\'t help the rest of the movie at all. The female love interest of Derek Zoolander lacked charisma, and though Ben\\'s real life dad Jerry Stiller (Seinfeld) was in this, he couldn\\'t save it either.Zoolander is a huge misfire because it tries to target a specific age group and, I think, fails mostly due to the fact that it\\'s not nearly as funny as it thinks it is. Sure, it has a few funny cameos from the likes of Billy Zane, David Duchovny and Will Ferrell, and there are a few funny one-liners including \"How are the children supposed to learn to read if they can\\'t even fit inside the building?\", but if you\\'ve already seen the trailer...you\\'ve seen the best bits.2.5/5\"', '\"Arghh.. yet another movie, whose trailer gives away all the best jokes. If you haven\\'t seen the trailer, see the movie :) If you have seen the trailer, don\\'t expect much more from the whole movie :(Reasonable movie, usual good acting from the good actors in the cast, nothing new from this movie though. Already been there, seen that.\"', '\"Being a thirtysomething single woman, Bridget Jones\\' Diary hit an emotional soft spot.  I could relate  to her fears of being alone, and the not-so-prudent choices she made in her love life.  What a performance...Renee\\'s London accent was not at all distracting, as she pulled it off brilliantly. I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who have waited 30+ years for something extraordinary...and are still looking.\"', '\"And that\\'s exactly what it is: dumb.  But not in the sighing, rolling your eyes, praying to higher powers that the movie would end kind of way.  It was dumb in that overly cheesy \"Austin Powers\" sort of way.  In other words, you have to be pretty clever to write a character that utterly dim.Some of the comments were just so implausible, so ludicrous, that you couldn\\'t help but laugh.  And I don\\'t mean that in a negative way.  Can Derek Zoolander really be that dense?  In this movie, he can and he is.  Ben Stiller as the overly mugging model was hilarious, but Owen Wilson as his arch-nemesis Hansel really stole the show.  I\\'m not even that big of a Will Ferrell fan, but he\\'s so over-the-top bizarre, you can\\'t help but laugh.  To paraphrase a quote I\\'ve heard before, \"he can make you laugh the way a drunken clown can make you scared.\"True, the plot\\'s a little thin with Zoolander brainwashed into killing the \"Prime Rib of Propecia\" (watch the movie to understand), but the great majority of the gags and the one-liners are the fun in getting there.  And it also has a lot of great \\'80\\'s songs bounding throughout the movie.It\\'s funny.  One of the funnier films I\\'ve seen for this year, so that adds a point to it, but at the same time, it loses a point for removing the World Trade Center buildings from the movie.  A sign of the times, I\\'m afraid.

I laugh every time I watch this movie it is so good. This is the perfect cast and you feel Ben Stiller\\'s character so well it makes you want to scream of frustration. It is done so well and I can\\'t wait for the sequel to arrive.I just really hope they don\\'t screw it up because this is gonna be a hard one to top. Robert DeNiro should get more recognition for this one, and Ben stiller too.

I thought they\\'d be a laugh. Wrong, well half wrong, I was blasted away by the sheer production of this sequel! Horrible.First off, I felt like Ice Cube and Mike Epps could have easily filmed this on a lazy Sunday afternoon and shipped this out while drunk to the movies. It was so hard to understand them talking because half the time they were talking at the same time...I was embarrassed for them! The jokes were so stale and stagnant I couldn\\'t even muster a snort of laughter because it was that bad...the Mexican gangsters were supposed to be the three stooges? I could have gotten high and I still would have thought this movie sucked. The suburbs???

But, when I watched it for a second time, hoping I would laugh as hard as the first time, I was kind of p*ssed off the way Ben Stiller\\'s character is blamed for everything, especially when you know how the film turns out. It is a little annoying.So, the first time I saw this, I loved it, the second time, I grew to dislike it a little bit. The cast is great, starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller of THERE\\'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, Teri Polo, Blythe Danner, James Rebhorn, Jon Abrahams, and Owen Wilson.But, I can also relate to the film in many ways, since I know a lot of people that compare to those in the film.I think the film is a major riot, but also a way to majorly upset someone. If you are the kind of person who finds it funny to blame stuff on innocent people, then you will love this movie. I did the first time and I still enjoy watching it from time to time. Just not for a way to spend free-time. See it when you have nothing better to do. MEET THE PARENTS gets 4/5.\"', '\"Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Blythe Danner and Owen Wilson star in this 2000 comedy. Gaylord \\'Greg\\' Focker (Stiller) is a male nurse who wants to marry his longtime girlfriend, Pam Byrnes (Polo). He decides to go with her to meet her parents, Jack (De Niro) and Dina (Danner) for the weekend in honor of her sister\\'s wedding. Things start to go very wrong for Gaylord when he tries to get Jack\\'s approval, but eventually wins his support and proposes to Pam. Wilson plays Pam\\'s ex-boyfriend, Kevin who is into carpentry and carves an altar that accidentally gets burned. De Niro is terrific as the father-in-law from hell and he and Stiller are great together. I recommend this good comedy.\"', '\"Meet the Parents is a good movie.Directed by Jay Roach.And the actors for the movie are perfectly picked.Everybody fits in his own character.It is a story about the love but this love is a tough job.The main character is Greg Focker.He is a nurse in the literally meaning of the word.His girlfriend is Pam who is a teacher of little children.They are both in love.The problem is that Greg has to live in Pam\\'s family\\'s house.And her family is not that good.Actually her mother is very nice woman who just want to help for the happiness of her daughter.The problem is Jack.Her father.He is a man of his word.He loves his daughter and he can kill if somebody hurt her.The meeting begins good but the first mistake that Greg makes is that he says,he doesn\\'t like cats and then a fluffy little cat goes in the hands of Jack.There are many jokes and fun.Even some intensive moments.The movie is one great big fun.Robert De Niro himself is the strict father and Ben Stiller is Greg.I give this movie 8 cause it is really a classic in the comedy genre.Enjoy.\"', '\"Don\\'t get me wrong, I enjoyed the performances of Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, and Renee Zellwegger more than held her own in the lead role.  I just thought the film a bit on the silly side, and many situations were contrived.  It could have been a comedy with some depth to it, but there were too many stock Hollywood sequences like a fight breaking out with the restaurant windows breaking and cliches like that.  The music didn\\'t fit well, it seemed too obvious that they were trying to sell the soundtrack. (I know, what else is new?)  The Pride and Prejudice parallel is really thin, see the BBC Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth if you want to see the real thing.\"', '\"But I freaking love this movie. I don\\'t like Owen Wilson. Jon Abrahams? C\\'mon. Ben Stiller? Hit (There\\'s Something About Mary - Along Came Polly) or Miss (Night at the Museum - The Watch). I\\'m indifferent to Teri Polo and Blythe Danner. I love De Niro, yeah, but in a comedy?And yet, everybody just works on this one. I absolutely adore every second of this movie for some reason (James Rebhorn is particularly amazing). I think the script and dialogue is so good that allows everybody to put on great performances. That\\'s all I got. I don\\'t really know why, but I love this movie and I saw it multiple times and it never gets even a bit worse.\"', '\"Well, not for me anyway. I am not a movie go-er who cares about sexual content, language, or expression (I\\'m a theatre student, what do you expect) but I was on the whole completely unentertained by the amazing misadventures of the Wayons brothers on their way to explore as many sexual sight gags as they could muster up. Why not spend more time emphasizing the jokes of the Scream movies (which were actually funny when explored) rather than spend uncanny amounts of time on sex. Hey, it wasn\\'t my movie; I am sure they had a reason for their jokes but if you are seriously looking for a movie filled with memorable and exciting gags that will keep you in stitches, you may feel a little jipped. Then again, maybe I would have thought it funnier in retrospect if I hadn\\'t got a parking ticket while I was waiting for more Doofy and less Cindy.\"', '\"Honestly speaking I had not very high expectations for this one. Not because I thought it was bad, but because so much is revealed in the trailers nowadays. So I figured all the funny jokes had been given away already. I was wrong. This movie is truly entertaining and hilarious. I don\\'t remember having such a great time at the movies in quite a while, even if some people think it is predictable, but... isn\\'t that the reason most of us go to movies anyway? To spend a good time, have a good laugh and hopefully forget some of our everyday worries? Well this film did it for me. Congratulations to Miss Bullock, she did great job both as producer and as a leading lady, and the supporting cast was amazing. 10/10\"', '\"This is a hilarious movie!! Ben Stiller is so funny, and so is Deniro!!The dinner scene is great! I can\\'t believe anyone could hate this movie!! Owen Wilson is also great as Kevin, Pam\\'s old boyfriend.  This movie has a great cast, great plot, is very funny, and is an overall great movie! 10 of 10 stars!!\"', '\"While it is, of course, the job of an actor to act, there are certain things that just can\\'t be done. Without straining the ability to suspend disbelief, for example, you could not have Oprah Winfrey play the biological mother of Haley Joel Osment. Having Bernie Mac play JFK would be another stretch that\\'s pretty much unimaginable. And the idea of having Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson play male models is on the same level.Some people might say that that\\'s the point - it\\'s inherently funny to have a man who resembles a chimpanzee and a man with half a nose playing models. That might be true, were it not for the fact that Ben Stiller, Jerry Stiller and Owen Wilson have, between them all, the comedic talents of a stale animal cracker. The only plus to this movie was Will Ferrell - that\\'s it.I have no idea what a person might find funny about Zoolander - clearly some people find it endlessly amusing, even some of my friends - but I can\\'t, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone that I don\\'t want to see commit suicide. If you really want to experience something that nearly emulates the amount of pain this movie will inflict without having to spend over an hour watching it, may I advise the following?Go duck hunting with Dick Cheney. Have an intimate encounter with a food processor. Dip your most sensitive bits in gravy and tease a rabid wolverine. Hug a wrecking ball (in use). Apply for a job brushing the teeth of great white sharks.Any of these will allow you to experience the sheer mental torture that \"Zoolander\" will inflict on you without actually having to invest the time in watching Ben Stiller \\'act\\'.\"', '\"What a dilemma! Do you go for the revved up, sexy bad boy or the stable, common sense, respectable, honorable and loyal... It deals with that, self esteem and the ups and down of fitting in. Isn\\'t it nice to see reality in a movie without blood and guts? Bridget is so vulnerable and yet she is stronger than she gives herself credit for. She is sensitive and sensible, yet she doesn\\'t know it yet. She also has to deal with parent issues and struggles of life. All the characters play their parts incredibly. They do such a great job you wonder how much of themselves they really are playing vs. acting. I think this is a great flick. I love it!\"', '\"I was very disappointed with ZOOLANDER. I like Ben Stiller\\'s work, but the movie really just had the same joke over and over; male models are dumb and pop culture is transparent. And by trying to hang some MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE plotline around such a flimsy movie idea to begin with, well it sunk fast. Yes, there are some laughs and even some clever scenes, but Derek Zoolander is such a dim, sullen lead character all it does is remind you whatan amazing feat AUSTIN POWERS really was. Thismovie wanted to try and pull off a satricial bullseye like that film but I feel it really missed it\\'s mark and one of thebig problems was that Stiller decided to direct it himself. The man is not a director. He is a fine actor, a good writer, but his three movies (REALITY BITES, CABLE GUY and now this) well they are patchy messes with no real rhythm or sense of honesty to them. As an actor, Stiller has never been better than in FLIRTING WITH DISASTER. But, Zoolander is like the lead - all one look, nothing else. BLAH!!!\"', '\"This movie is pure evil.  Undistilled, simple, heinous evil.The 80\\'s were about bigger and bigger explosions, the 90\\'s are about bigger and bigger disgusting, unreal sex jokes.  The Wayans boys thought: \"Hmm, the Farrelys are making money.  Let\\'s just make an incredibly stupid movie for frat boys everywhere!\"This film is degrading to humans and other life forms.  The lead character is subjected to forms of sexual abuse that would make people picket a porno theatre (and people are letting their kids watch this).  The makers thought that parodying a self-parody like \"Scream\" somehow makes sense; instead they end up recycling exact dialogue from other movies and we\\'re supposed to laugh at it?If you give it a second of thought, this movie is disgusting, insulting, and frankly about as funny as \"The Sweet Hereafter.\"  To be blunt:  I\\'d rather have my entire body shaved by a jittery chimpanzee on a caffeine high before ever watching even one second of this piece of crap ever again!  (I also understand these chimps are hard at work on the sequel.)\"', '\"Whether or not you want \"Everyone in a Panic\" renewed the face of the American besteirol and scored the first big success in terms of comedy in the early 2000s, a movie that draws on horror movies to create satire is simply great, and everyone in a panic, can do it perfectly, it is impossible not to watch the first film in this saga without losing air or not to cry with their absurd and utterly stupid jokes that catch us for their cheap and stupid, comical, offensive and stupid humor. Stew. Everyone in a panic is provocative, amused by their complete comic idiocy.\"', '\"Quite possibly the funniest thing I\\'ve seen in years.  I laughed so hard I thought I was going to have a stroke.  I thought this was a bit of a different type role for Hugh Grant, which he really pulls off well. Interesting to see him playing a dark character.\"', '\"If you are not, you won\\'t.  It\\'s a really clean movie, except for one silly orgy scene, (no nudity) so you can take the kids, (although they won\\'t get the jokes.)It\\'s really well done.  This is a nine, folks.\"', '\"I had to watch the first movie before going to see the second. I\\'m hearing mixed reviews about Zoolander 2 but I don\\'t care. I\\'m still going to watch it. I heard it flopped and that is a good thing because it means they\\'re not going to make a Zoolander 3. Zoolander was meant to be a stand alone film. Anyway, what can I say to review this film? It is a comedic classic that stands the test of time. You\\'ll have a grin on your face for most of the movie. The one part that was a little played out was the scene were Zoolander and Hansel are looking for files inside the computer and slapping it around like apes. The joke goes on for a few seconds longer than it should have but that\\'s about it. The only negative thing I have to say about this movie, which has been quoted by me maybe over a million times.\"', '\"What to say! I kept hearing about this film during my first few years at secondary school, as Scary Movie 3 had just come out. So I decided to watch it and I\\'m glad I did! What an achievement,comedy everywhere you look, TASTEFUL gore (not simply blood everywhere) and a selection of decent actors. Anna Faris will most likely have a great movie career, the Wayans brothers were a nice touch, as was Shannon Elizabeth, Lochlyn Munro and another intriguing character, Regina Hall. All I can say is see this film, have some laughs and buy the sequels as soon as possible, as they are equally fantastic in all aspects of comedy and quite possibly, horror!\"', '\"This has simply got to be one of the sorriest excuses for a movie ever made. The only reason that I didn\\'t leave the theatre was that my girlfriend\\'s 8 year old son was with us, and he thought it was hilarious. Hmmm, and it\\'s rated 14-A in Canada. Terrible acting, terrible script, terrible plot, and on the satire side - also awful.I will say this though - good soundtrack.\"', '\"This is one of those movies where you will laugh nonstop.  I haven\\'t laughed so hard at a movie since I went to see Liar Liar a few years back.  A must see for those that love to laugh.  Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro\\'s characters interact extremely well setting the atmosphere for the entire catastrophic weekend to follow.  Following the nonstop disaster of a boyfriend meeting the parents for the first time left the whole audience within the theatre laughing.\"', '\"Being that I am not the \"stick insect\" and am more the \"Bridget Jones\", I have to say ... Yep! I\\'ve been there, I\\'ve done that ... and even through all my humiliation, I laughed. Thank goodness they made a movie about it! I roared with laughter and felt the tears. But happy endings are possible and not just in the movies. This story is definitely the modernization of Jane Austen\\'s \"Pride and Prejudice\" but is more true to life than the funky \"Clueless\". Men may not understand all the things women are about, but I bet most will be able to see at least part of Bridget in their girlfriends or wives. Women have long known that their are only two types of men ... the bad boy and the nice boy. The only question is, which do they prefer. I think Bridget has the right idea.\"', '\"** out of (****)\"Scary Movie\". What was once hailed as a modern classic in the realm of parody, is now a faded memory. And... I could see why. The 2000 gut-buster is actually pretty funny in some areas. The director realizes the typical horror clichÃ©s so he mocks those, sometimes intelligent, other times not. But see, that\\'s just it. For every knee-buckling gag, there\\'s also a tired one. That\\'s why I\\'m so disappointed in \"Scary Movie\". It has the potential to be there, but it never reaches that point.What jokes work? The ones that wink at the horror downfalls without going in for the kill. Subtle, yet effective. Which ones don\\'t? The gags that involve sex, racist stereotypes, utter stupidity, and homosexuality. Now I\\'m no prude, and with these subjects the humor could\\'ve still been there, but the way the jokes are handled are very child-like and quite painful.All in all, the 2000 Wayans concoction isn\\'t a bad one, but it could\\'ve been better. About half of the jokes work, but the other half don\\'t. And you know, that half does count even if you think it doesn\\'t. This might not be a \"Meet the Spartans\", but it sure isn\\'t any \"Airplane\".\"', '\"I saw BJD last night with my wife, who has been asking about this film for weeks now.  I kept putting it off, thinking it to be another clunky, formulaic romance film.  I wasn\\'t exactly incorrect, but the film is rather inventive in how it handles some conventional situations.Renee Zellweger did a fine job as Bridget Jones, although it\\'s difficult to see why men would find her physically unattractive, even with the modest weight gain Zellweger had for the movie.  I thought she looked terrific. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth (one of my favorite underused actors) swap their normal roles around for this film, and both are outstanding.  Grant is the sophisticated, ethically challenged Lothario, Daniel Cleaves (nary a stutter!) while Firth\\'s character seems almost unable to break outside of himself at all.  You can feel Mark Darcy\\'s tension, his wanting to express himself and his despair at not being able to do so.  I\\'d say Firth\\'s performance is easily the best in the film.Unfortunately, but not too importantly, the crucial plot twists in the story are pretty obvious to anyone with half a brain, especially the one concerning Cleaves and Darcy.  In the meantime, there\\'s a lot of edgy humor in watching Jones bounce from disaster to disaster, trying to exceed her own abilities and in a few instances succeeding.  Some people have commented on her lack of moderation in drink, tobacco, and sex and how that made her unsympathetic.  That seems to me to be a somewhat sexist point of view, as many films feature male characters with the same exact issues, and these manage to garner sympathetic reviews.One last note: Previous reviews have mentioned \"Someone Like You\" in comparison to BJD.  My thoughts were on \"Circle of Friends\", which dealt with an overweight central female character trying to break free of her own expectations and those of the people around her.  While I really enjoyed BJD, and CoF doesn\\'t have the same edgy humor, I think CoF does a much better job of handling the central conflict of both films and treats the characters better.  (Colin Firth is also in CoF, although he is in his traditional jerk character.)  When Bridget Jones\\' Diary comes out on DVD, my wife will be clamoring for a copy, and then we\\'ll put both on the same night and have a film duel!\"', '\"Next Friday (2000): Dir: Steve Carr / Cast: Ice Cube, Mike Epps, John Witherspoon, Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister, Tamala Jones: Brainless mess with absolutely no reason for existing. Sequel to Friday with Ice Cube writing and narrating the film. He was responsible for Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister landing in prison but after an escape, Cube is sent to live with his Uncle Elroy. Cube\\'s cousin works at Pinky\\'s Record Store where he hides out on his pregnant girlfriend. Next door live drug dealers with a nasty pit bull. There is a subplot involving taxes and saving the property etc. Witless and predictable with uninspiring directing by Steve Carr. Ice Cube plays the humourless lead, which works against the mood of the film. It is as if Cube arrived on the wrong set. Mike Epps plays Cube\\'s best friend who is a complete idiot. John Witherspoon plays Cube\\'s less than friendly father. Perhaps the worst element is an embarrassing appearance by Lister who breaks out of prison and seeks revenge on Cube. Perhaps he should seek out the producers of this film. Tamala Jones plays Epps\\'s pregnant ex-girlfriend although being part of this film gives her something else to be angry about. The conclusion presents theft and drugs as fun as oppose to the endless trouble brought to those who dabbled in it. Nothing of value in this film that prides itself on being stupid. This film should be tossed in a campfire for a marshmallow roast. Score: 1 / 10\"', '\"I loved both Meet the Parents films. I don\\'t know which one I liked more because they were both hilarious. Both Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller are fantastic in these films. Director Jay Roach has brought us his best films to date. Some people find Austin Powers stupid. I think it\\'s really funny, but I prefer Meet the Parents more. Robert De Niro\\'s Jack Byrnes\\' character reminds me of my father. I mean my dad wasn\\'t in the C.I.A or anything like that but he sure does scare some people. De Niro\\'s character in Meet the parents is kind of an asshole because he goes out of his way to make Greg(Ben Stiller) look bad. It feels that way at least. I think that, though Austin Powers was hilarious, Meet the parents is a comedy that everyone can enjoy. It is the definitely better version of Son in Law. I wasn\\'t a fan of Son in Law, but I love this film. The acting is a lot better and the film is a lot funnier than Son in Law. Not that I have a problem with Pauly Shore, it\\'s just that I prefer Ben Stiller. I am one of those people. Well, I doubt that Ben Stiller will go and fake his death like Pauly Shore did. Well, it was just a film, but Pauly Shore really hasn\\'t done anything in so long. Both Meet he parents\\' films are laugh riots, and I love the original. Both of them are great though.\"', '\"I really thought i wouldn\\'t like this movie. Fart jokes just don\\'t appeal to me, however i started to like Anna Faris\\'s character Cindy. She was funny, stupid and innocent. I think they spoofed the right film because Scream was really stupid but in a good way so I\\'m glad they spoofed that. Scary Movie is a nonstop gag fest that anyone can enjoy. So long as your over 18. The ending was fantastic if a little predictable. Shaon Elizabeth was great. Overall it was soo funny and soo cool. Some jokes are bad and some really bad but on a hit/miss basis there is more hits than misses. At some point it can be scary in a weird way. its also quite gory, I\\'m not going to get into any detail because my reviews are spoiler free but if you watch it you will see. Some parts where boring but others exciting. so overall this is a very funny movie with some bad moments.*****/*****\"', '\"Jonathan Lynn is the cat\\'s meow.

How did this actorwho had so little to contribute to (granted, the markedly lesscompelling) Isn\\'t She Whatever, the Jacqueline Susanne vehicle,come across as such an energized goofball goddess in this movie? Was it Jonathan, the stars? Bruce is less tedious than usual. I wonder if he had anything todo with choosing the inspired jazz venue and soundtrack.

An easy see, and another reason to praise the almighty Ly\"', '\"This is a movie that took me a time or two to warm up to it, and now it just gets better the more I watch it.  WARNING*****  this is by no means a good film.  There are tons of better and funnier movies out there that you could watch, and if you do watch this one, you might not like it at all.  So make no mistake, it is really stupid, you just have to check your brain at the door, and enjoy all of the shameless cameos by, well, everybody.\"', '\"This movie has some funny moments. Like the bedroom scene with the homosexual football player and his girlfriend. But most of the jokes were very weak and if I\\'ve grinned three times during this movie that would be a lot. Don\\'t get me wrong I love comedy, but to me this was just a collection of mostly weak jokes. A weak attempt to earn money by making fun other movies.I am glad I didn\\'t watch this one in the cinema, it would have been a waste of my money. This is the kind of movie you watch when it comes on TV, and you have nothing else to do.\"', '\"From slaptickey sight gags and pratfalls to more sophisticated humor such as Arquette\\'s negotiation of a hit man\\'s retainer at that moment during sex when he\\'s most likely to be agreeable, this nonstop barrage of humor has something funny for all adults.

It\\'s broad comedic appeal may be it\\'s greatest virtue.\"', '\"In my opinion, Mathew Perry carries the film on his shoulders.  He was very funny and added humor to every scene in which he was in.  Bruce Willis is his usual hard self and theres even some nudity for the guys.  But just because of Mathew Perry\\'s performance I\\'m giving this a high 7.\"', '\"I assumed this was going to be a sendup of the genre, a la Airplane and the Naked Gun, but Noooooooo.  This movie is constructed for the absolutely lowest common denominator.  It goes for the most obvious gags, and even telegraphs them!  Excuse me, driving a big red truck through here...The script is abysmal, the acting would be better if it were even WOODEN, and the editing is amateurish.Apparently these filmmakers felt it was necessary to ladle on heaping doses of sex, sexual language, sexual and homophobic innuendo, and gross \"humor\" to make the movie watchable.  They couldn\\'t have been more wrong. Instead, they\\'ve come up with a juvenile attempt to pander to a mindless audience who will laugh at anything, and that doesn\\'t care how they spend their entertainment dollars as long as they can throw their brains into neutral for an hour or two.\"', '\"Before I was forced to watch this movie I had already guessed the story. Some of the gags were amusing but they just had Ben Stiller, aka Gaylord \\'Greg\\' Focker, messing up EVERY single thing. It made the movie very tired.This movie could\\'ve been much better (but not less predictable) if they\\'d had half as many gags but made them more likely and deeper.Not one of Robert De Niro\\'s better moments. Shame really.\"', '\"Ben Stiller created the `Derek Zoolander\\' character for a five minute sketch on the VH1 Fashion Awards.  The antics of the incredibly stupid male model was a big hit, and so they decided to greenlight a full length movie about the character.  But the producer\\'s overlooked one thing.  Derek Zoolander is a one-joke character.  And so its no surprise that the full length movie built around him falls flatter than a bad perm.I was amazed by how few laughs this movie had.  And the few jokes that were in `Zoolander,\\' have already been revealed in the trailer! Now `Zoolander\\' does have its moments, the celebrity cameos for example, are funny.  But they are the exception.  So if someone asks you to go see `Zoolander,\\' runway.  I mean, run away!  2 stars out of 5.\"', '\"Scary Movie could have been fun.  It COULD have been side-splitting hilarity.  Unfortunately, the script seems to have been written by adolescents with hormone-induced stupidity and immaturity.Scary Movie is filled to the brim with jokes that fall flat: there are unnecessary flatulence jokes, body fluid/sex jokes to the extreme, genitalia that does not look fake at all, and some scenes that are directly lifted from other horror movies in order to be parodied, but instead drag on and on forever to a laughless death.  The ONLY scene that is a brilliantly inspired parody is NOT from a horror movie, and you have to wait until the VERY end to see it.  An R-rating? It\\'s ludicrous that serious, quality films like Tom Soldonz\\' Happiness and others are condemned by the MPAA to have scenes cut or be released unrated for having controversial topics/scenes.  This piece of drek drags out some of the most offensive, thoroughly squirm-inducing and tasteless acts, language, and images ever imagined, yet gets an R-rating just fine.And as for the Wayans, their creativity seems to have dwindled ever since In Living Color ended.  Their show was a funny, brilliant, daring satire at times.  This movie, however, is a testament to how dumbed-down, empty, and money-hungry some entertainers become for a paycheck.3 out of 10\"', '\"This movie was pretty bad.  Every now and again there was a trace of real wit, as in a few of the direct parodies of scenes from the \"Scream\" or the \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" movies (I particularly liked the pretty heroine yelling, \"C\\'mon! Do it!\", ala Jennifer Love Hewitt from the \"I Know\" flicks--very funny!).  The \"Blair Witch Project\" bit was clever, and well-done.  But overall, the Wayans brothers humor isn\\'t stupid-funny (as in the sublime \"Airplane\" or \"Top Secret\" flicks) it\\'s just groaningly, unfunny-stupid.  A shame, had it been made with a little more finesse, it could have really been something.\"', '\"Any Jane Austen fans out there who adored the A&E mini series of the great book \"Pride and Prejudice\" will adore Bridget Jones\\' Diary.  Although Renee Zellweger\\'s accent leaves something to be desired in places, she does a decent job of portraying a Brit.  But, then, what can you expect? Honestly. Colin Firth (Mark Darcy) is, as usual, stunning in this movie.  He does a phenomenal job of taking Mr. Darcy out of the Jane Austen movie and snapping him forward almost two hundred years and making it realistic.  Granted, a lot of this is credit to the author of the book (and the screenwriters), but he really does a smashing job and it does help that he was in that original great production of \"Pride and Prejudice\".  Again, for any Jane Austen fans, you will greatly appreciate the wealth of random \"Jane Austen movie\" characters from other adaptations of her books: Gemma Jones, James Faulkner, Jim Broadbent, Embedth Davidtz, Hugh Grant (of course), and Colin Firth (of course)!  It\\'s a great plug for the origination of this storyline.  And it really is a great modern adaptation of Jane Austen.  Not quite as inventive as \"Clueless\", but great nonetheless.  Props to Helen Fielding for her great novel, and as well to the screenwriters.  This is a movie I would recommend to almost anyone.  Although, I have heard the criticism that the female character is whiny and unintelligent and on a completely lower eschelon than Mark Darcy (from a man, of course), I would definitely say this is a movie for the woman who has always wanted that one unattainable man--as well as a movie for those who believe in true love and that it truly does conquer all...even drunken stupidity, clumsiness, and outright moronic behavior. This movie proves that attraction and connection honestly are the two most important things when it comes to how we choose a life-partner...and that they\\'re not exactly something we can control...\"', '\"Man, every time I watch black comedies, it makes me feel evil.... Anyway, this movie was my most favorite black comedy (and my first one, too), and this movie does have meaning in it. The humor in this movie was a bit stupid, but once again, it did have meaning in it. I was surprised when a person mentioned that Greg\\'s last name is Focker, which is surprising when I saw this movie. And there was another part when you realize that Greg\\'s real name is Gaylord Focker. I was also surprised by this, too, because who would name their son, Gaylord? I hope to see the reason why the Fockers decided to name their son Gaylord, because I\\'ve seen Meet the Parents, and now I want to see Meet the Fockers. I\\'ve seen the trailers in the official site, and I thought it was hilarious. Since I can\\'t write spoilers for this movie, I have to tell you guys this: This movie actually has meaning! So, watch it!\"', '\"When I saw the preview for this movie, I thought, Hey this is going to be a great movie.  Now that I\\'ve wasted $7 to see this movie all I can say is OVERKILL.  The jokes were much more crude than the ones in South Park:Bigger Longer and Uncut, and they ran anything remotely funny deep into the cold, cold ground. Two  questions pop into my head when I think about this movie: How in the world did this movie get an R rating? and Why didn\\'t Dimension Films give me the millions of dollars they flushed down the toilet? I\\'ve only really hated four movies in my life.  Now I can add another to the list.\"', '\"Bridget Jones\\'s Diary is a surprisingly good movie.  Detractors who deride it for its admittedly minimalist plot miss the point - this is a film that shows life without the layers of artificiality favoured by directors (resulting in movies somehow removed from the realm of the everyday in which us mere mortals dwell).  Life is frequently aimless and trivial; and therein lies the movie\\'s attraction.  Notwithstanding of course that this is a very funny and highly original comedy.\\nBridget (played with considerable aplomb by Renee Zellweger) belongs to the ranks of that modern phenomenon - the over-30, unmarried career woman. Just when it seems Bridget may be destined for terminal spinster-hood, two opposing forces enter her life - charming cad Daniel, and uptight (but very sexy) lawyer Mark.  Which of the two is her Mr. Right?  And why does everyone insist on asking that question detested by all singletons - \"How\\'s your love life going?\"  The movie\\'s conclusion is predictable, and although any other ending would leave the audience feeling cheated, it does seem somewhat tame and ultimately unsatisfying.\\nThe film encourages the viewer both to get involved with Bridget emotionally and to laugh at her at the same time.  Perhaps the best joke is the milieu inhabited by her parents - where the mini-gherkin is the height of sophistication, and 60-year-olds throw garden parties with such alarming themes as \\'tarts and vicars\\'.  Bridget is certainly no social butterfly, and whilst we cringe at her public embarrassments (notably her TV report involving a fireman\\'s pole and a bottom the size of Brazil), we triumph with her when she manages to turn a bad situation to her advantage.  Maybe we can recognise a little bit of Bridget Jones in all of us.\"', '\"When I see the trailer and spots of this movie, I thought it would be funny. I was wrong. Sure, the movie has some funny scenes, but there isn\\'t much of them. I\\'ve seen the VH-1 spots and I think that the film doesn\\'t have enough ideas like the spots have. Zoolander is quite entertaining, because of the good performances. Stiller is good as Zoolander and Wilson is excellent as Hansel. Will Ferrell is good also, but doesn\\'t have enough screen time. Too bad that the movie isn\\'t quite funny... ** out of *****\"', '\"Dear Movie Fan, This movie was just dumb and moronic. I didn\\'t laugh once at the stupid jokes. All the jokes were mainly about drugs and sex, what ever happened to good comedies like Monty Python\\'s Search for the Holy Grail. This movie was a waste of money and if you have movie taste you won\\'t like this movie, this is just a warning if you haven\\'t seen this movie to not see this movie...\"', '\"A stupid movie for stupid people! There is absolutely nothing funny in this movie, americans really need to learn how to make a parody this is just embarrassing!\"', '\"I went to see \"Scary Movie\" with not a lot of expectation. The reviews were mixed, although the movie had grabbed the most $$$ in the opening weekend. I had seen the trailer and it was not too tempting either. Still, curiosity got the best of me. And believe me, the movie is not that bad. Just try and avoid taking your parents with you, or for that matter, your kids. Some of the stuff is really gross... I mean REALLY REALLY gross.\\nAs it is a spoof, so don\\'t expect any coherent story-line or plot, although the movie generally tags along the line of IKWYDLS, in between, several other ideas are thrown in. \"The Sixth Sense\" bit (\"I See Dead People\") was added, probably at the last minute, therefore it was totally disconected.The first scene of the movie, Carmen, running around in her underwear, was classic stuff. Just like any James Bond movie, the first scene HAD no relevance to the rest of the movie :-)Then the story picked up, when it started following the IKWYDLS routine, with several really interesting spoofs. The bit where the Cameron Diaz-like cum scene was created, was overdone. So was the gut-wretching male orgasm. It made the audience go wild, nevertheless. The grosser the better, it seems.The bit, which was picked up from \"The Matrix\" was surreal, but then the whole movie was surreal. The end of the movie made a mockery of the tag line \"... No Sequel\". Interesting Stuff.All in all, a couple of hours worth spent, with genuine laughs and some really wild scenes. Worth it. I\\'d give it an 8.5 anytime.\"', '\"It is nice to see a movie now and then that isn\\'t either 2 and half hours of melodramatic crap with over inflated actors or a comedy that is littered with big name actors that simply ARE NOT FUNNY.  But this movie was.  Very light hearted, and not afraid to poke fun at itself, The Whole Nine Yards is a good \"sit back, turn off the brain, and laugh\" kind of movie. Everyone in it does a great job. Not the funniest movie on earth, but better than most of the stuff I have seen lately.\"', '\"Scary Movie (2000, Dir. Keenen Ivory Wayans)StoryA group of teenagers including Cindy Campbell and Bobby Prinze, accidentally hit a man when driving, and dispose of the body, but now they are being stalked by a very recognisable masked killer. The victim count increases, whilst Cindy must survive the carnage that has she has seen in so many films before.ActorsAt the time of the release, many of the stars featured in \\'Scary Movie\\' are young and very unrecognisable among the audience. They don\\'t do a bad job in it and really fit into the world of parody films. They seem to fit in so much that at times, they do seem a tad bit annoying, but for the tone of the film they seem suitable for it. Music\\'Scary Movie\\' is simply a parody of horror films, and it only seems right that the music of the scenes fits the film in which it parodies. The films which it\\'s parodying, especially \\'Scream\\' and \\'I Know What You Did Last Summer\\' have a deep, beating, suspenseful theme, and \\'Scary Movie\\' produces music very music like it. Special EffectsLike many parody films, the special effects are seen ad more comedic effects. Instead of using digital effects in this film, there is a more common use of physical props. Sometime, they look quite realistic and disgusting, such as the testicles appearing and sometimes look quite unrealistic and again disgusting, such as a dummy of Cindy being sprayed with seamen. Overall, most of the effects in this film are either disgusting or sex related. ConclusionWhen the film was originally released, it was quite entertaining, but as the years go on, it starts to lose its comedic factor. This movie really seemed to be the start of the downfall of parody films, as we are now presented with such \"gems\" as Date Movie and Epic Movie. You would be better suited if you have seen the movies it\\'s parodying first, before you see this film, as you would understand the scenes more and find it a lot funnier.\"What is it?\"Â– Bobby (Jon Abrahams) \"What is it? She\\'s gone and she\\'s not coming back\" Â– Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) \"Its been over a year, Cindy\" Â– Bobby (Jon Abrahams) \"But Ginger was such an important part of the Spice Girls\" Â– Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris)\"', '\"This movie is absolutely hilarious!  Watch for the cameos -- I have to see it again to catch them all.  Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Farrell are the three funniest men on the planet.  Jerry Stiller had me cracking up in every scene!  If you\\'re ready for a good laugh do yourself a favor and go see Zoolander!\"', '\"This was 1 of those movies were I was hoping it would be good, and wanted to come out of theater saying \"WOW that was great!\" but the smile just didn\\'t come to my face. Zoolander wasn\\'t much better than it looked like the trailers.. An interesting plot, and mostly no product placements, unlike the ridiculous Josie and the Pussy cats. Zoolander was funny sometimes, but Ben\\'s \"look\" got old pretty quick. The moral of the movie, which there is in every movie, was deep, yet had it been delivered in a different way, it would have been more convincing and, the lazy humor wouldn\\'t have been so painful and disappointing, or wouldn\\'t have SEEMED that way, had the producers ELABORATED upon that moral a little more. Then, I would have been more impressed. Please, spare me the bluish-gray lipstick thing and use that silent, jokes-fallen-flat-second a little wiser.\"', '\"Being a long time fan of the BJD books (three years and counting), I had nothing but high hopes for the movie version. I was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview last night, and I was not disappointed. The movie, like the book, has the most hilarious lines and moments, and each of the actors portrayed their characters so well you couldn\\'t imagine anyone else in that part.  Renee Zellweger IS Bridget, there is just no arguing it. No other actress could have pulled off what Renee did in this movie. Hugh Grant makes for an excellent Daniel, who is completely two faced and has a smarmy sort of charm that makes you want him just as badly as Bridget does. Colin Firth is a superb Mark Darcy, but that was a given because the character was practically written with him in mind - as all avid BJD readers know, Mark Darcy\\'s character is a play on the Mr. Darcy Firth portrayed in Pride and Prejudice.Some of the more hardcore fans of the book may be disappointed with all the missing jokes and scenes, but to film the entire book would have left us with a 10 hour movie. The writers did an excellent job distilling the essence of the novel, and the finished product has all the charm and wit of the original. The audience, many of whom I\\'m sure have never read the book (and many of whom, surprisingly, were male), laughed nonstop throughout the film, and everyone seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. As for those of us who have read it, I do believe that this is one of those rare book-to-movie jobs that was really spot-on, and everything that was noticeably changed in the process only makes the movie better.  So go see it, it\\'s hands-down one of the best movies of 2001 so far.\"', '\"I dunno, apparently I\\'m the only one out here who didn\\'t like this movie. I left the movie feeling cheated and upset. It felt like a bad episode of Three\\'s Company, with a big budget.The humor was weak and thin, most of the funny moments were shown in the previews, and the especially sad part was, over and over there were WONDERFULLY funny situations and setups, that would just fall flat. Most of the humor was the kind of disparaging \"how embarrassed can we make the poor little Jewish boy\" junk that Three\\'s Company and it\\'s ilk made famous.Apparently the rest of the world loves this movie, but I was embarrassed walking out of the theatre, and wouldn\\'t recommend this movie to my worst enemy (well, maybe him, since he has no taste anyway).\"', '\"What was nice about this film was Martin Lawrence\\'s costume portrayal of Big Mamma!  He did a great job of making it believable!  Nia Long, a single mother without a husband, provided the standard love interest of a standard formula of a cop \"falling\" for the pretty girl and \"proving\" that she was not guilty of a crime.  The church scenes were quite enjoyable as well as the musical performances.  It\\'s nice to see older actors with many roles in this film.  Today\\'s movies with all young people may be popular but are unrealistic as real life people have older parents, relatives and other associates.  The on-film chemistry between Lawrence - Long was good!  You should enjoy this film for the fun that it provides.  Don\\'t look for too many morals, other than good triumphs over evil!\"', '\"To all those chubby girls out there with bad people skills, a clumsy sense of humour and absolutely no hope, comes this charming rom-com about the one Bridget Jones who\\'s profile is all of the above, and yet she always manages to stumble into the light at the end of the tunnel after rolling around in dirt before of course. This movie, even with the hilarious script and the two British men who make every married woman wish they weren\\'t (Grant and Firth), the movie would not have been such a success with Renee Zellweger, who once again proved to be one of the best comedy actresses we have around. Relieving audience of the usual clichÃ©d romance stories that get thrown in their faces, or the mindless comedies, comes this masterpiece that revives the rom-com genre and has you pulled in from the first scene, being so incredibly relatable and the idea that its never too late for a happy ending even if you haven\\'t met Mr.Right in your teens or your 20\\'s when everything\\'s still pointing up is just another perkI would recommend everyone to give this movie a go!\"', '\"At first I thought it just be a gimmick type movie but I was pleasantly surprised. It had a lot of good ideas and it reaches its goals. It goes a little overboard in some parts but generally its a real funny movie. DeNiro is hilarious in this one. He\\'s just so over the top unbelieveably cruel. Gaylord Focker is the funniest most outrageous name for a character I have ever heard. The racing scene between Deniro and Focker was my favourite moment, just the looks on their faces made me laugh. It wasn\\'t the best funny movie I ever seen thats for sure and that certainly is not what i am trying to imply but it is undeniably good. 8 out of 10\"', '\"This movie has a fun opening, that immediately caught my attention. Thevarious twists that it continued with were funny and interesting. Themovie tends to turn the way you normally look at things (as portrayedby the main character) upside down, which is enjoyable. However, afterthe middle part of the movie things become too clear, making the restof the movie slightly less enjoyable. It is still a good movie towatch, though.\"', '\"i first read \\'bridget jones diary\\' when i was about 14 (although being young i didn\\'t really understand some of it) i was so excited however when i heard that they were making a movie and i really wanted to see it when it came out, i wasn\\'t disappointed it is funny, likable, and after i watch this film (everytime) i am left with a warm feeling inside (mainly because in the end the single girl gets the cute, smart boy and is happy) and i can also relate to bridget and most of her \\'embrassing\\' situations, shes just like us, shes normal, there is depth to her that make her down to earth but at the same time she so out of this world that she takes us to another place. The actors, all different work amazingly well together (although when i heard i couldn\\'t see it working)however it does, they connect. This is an excellent film and there should be a law that everyone must see it\"', '\"This story is about an undercover FBI agent (Sandra Bullock), who is \"infiltrating a Miss America beauty pageant. Laughable plot, but still quite enjoyable, because the jokes are executed with great timing and are quite funny. Terrific supporting role by Michael Caine.One of Sandra Bullock\\'s better comedy roles of her entire carreer, with excellent comical oneliners and some decent acting, BUT this movie really lasts an half an hour too long. Most comedies never pass the 90 minutes mark and for good reason. This comedy lasts almost 2 hours, which is stretching an already paperthin story to a breaking point. Starts out as a 7 star comedy, but because of it somewhat tedious end part I downgrade this movie to 6 stars.\"', '\"I only gave this movie a 1 for stupid, and the rest is just crap, sick, and disgusting. I thought this was going to be good. The second one was not much better, and then they went to PG-13, and that made this series even worse. I don\\'t think I watch them past the second one, because they were so bad. I think these films that like to go laugh at stuff like this is to keep themselves from laughing at their own stupidity.I never really thought that acting stupid in a movie was funny. Now, if people were doing this stuff for real and not faking it would be funny. Ha Ha, but no it is obvious that watching this is like watching a stupid comedy play of how to be stupid and try and make people laugh at the dumb crap they can do on a movie set. It is called spoofing horror and spoofing stupidity of themselves. Utter crap this series was and is. I don\\'t go for comedy that is \"how can I be stupid for the day?\". Enjoy if your into crap like this.\"', '\"I had really looked forward to this movie, and when I finally saw it, It was horrible. The humor is so childish and boring. I could hardly watch the whole movie. Maybe its because I didn\\'t see all the other scary movies it maked fun off, but thats just tough.\"', '\"Just when I think a movie can\\'t get any worse, along comes Zoolander. This is absolutely one of the worst movies I have EVER seen. It isn\\'t funny, it isn\\'t clever, the script is awful, the direction awkward, the mixture of morality and lessons and feeble humor unbelievably lame and poorly done.  It is awful from top to bottom and side to side.The only thing that I was looking forward to was maybe, maybe, Ben Stiller would take his shirt off or something, but we didn\\'t even get that! In all seriousness, Ben Stiller is a good actor, and he had a concept which could conceivably have been hilarious, but it takes more than one single good actor to make a movie. There are many many funny movies, that I have laughed it, (most from the far past), so I am not without a sense of humor, you see. It is absolutely beyond my comprehension how so many critics can think this is a good movie. But then, for all I know this is better than much of what\\'s out there these days.\"', '\"I managed to get to the end of this movie because of my love for Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis. But even their characters were terrible. The storyline is not good enough to keep you captivated and the characters are all unrealistic and annoying. Amanda Peet\\'s perky breasts made me give this forgettable movie two extra stars because it was a 3/10 for me.\"', '\"Yes this movie was stupid but I wasn\\'t expecting anything other then lowbrow comedy so I enjoyed this movie.  It was a Naked Gun style horror movie, the kind of movie where they just throw in parodies of everything they can think of, or just throw in anything they can into some scenes.  Still I think most people looking for a good waste of time comedy will enjoy this movie even if they do say it was stupid.\"', '\"I got to see the sneak preview of Scary Movie last Thursday night - for free.  I remember first hearing about the movie back when they were going to call it, \"Scream If You Know What I Did Last Summer,\" and was looking forward to it.  I heard last week that Mom & Pop Wayans left during the premiere.  I now understand why.The movie had its funny points where I laughed heartily.  Those were few and far between.  Most of the time, I was embarrassed to be in the theater, with the people I was with.  Many of the sight gags had me gagging.  This movie was definitely more gross than funny.\"', '\"This movie is possibly the best comedy I\\'ve seen this summer. Of course I may be a bit partial because I\\'m a huge Williamson fan and admired the way the Wayans brothers spoofed his work. Is it just me or did everyone, including the critics, seem to missed the Brady references? Cindy, Bobby, Greg...sure they were subtle, but I like them, especially how it when with the Wayans\\' commentary on the \"whiteness\" Williamson\\'s films. Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m a big Williamson fan but I appreciate humor in any form. Going back to the \"whiteness\" commentary, the Wayans\\' have several references in the movie that are funny including a reference to Williamson\\'s commentary in Scream 2. The best part of the movie is that you\\'re guaranteed a laugh or groan from scene to scene with just enough time to catch your breath. Going back to Williamson, the movie takes pot shots at his films\\' self-awareness which I found amusing, fans of Williamson\\'s work will also be rewarded with a semi-unexpected cameo. The film loosely ties together Dimension\\'s Scary Thriller plotlines well enough that anyone who\\'s seen them will get a good laugh out of them. I was a bit disappointed in not seeing any spoofing or reference to the last of the Scream Trilogy. As for the, \"Oh my god, that\\'s offensive\" stance some seem to have with this film and others such as \"Me, myself and Irene\"...why don\\'t you tight <explicative> calm the <explicative> down and laugh. The whole point of these films (to me) is to point out how erroneous those types of views, stereotyping and such are...a movie isn\\'t real life, movies can comment on real life, but in the end it is we, the viewers, that make that commentary possible. Don\\'t protest to change a movie, protest to change reality. (Note: I am a minority) Overall, a great movie spoof. Over-analyzed or under-analyzed, don\\'t take it seriously...it is, after all, a comedy.\"', '\"Sandy nailed this one. I\\'m not going over it scene by scene. It was so funny and entertaining I just can\\'t stop watching it. Caine added laugh after laugh. Sandy\\'s wonderful smile was as bright as the sun as always. I lied. I said I wasn\\'t going to go over scenes ,but; I must. Her smile at the pool melted me. While doing aerobics, Miss Texas gives her a look that say\\'s \"you are not going to win\"! Stan Fields goes on and on while the building is burning down. Funny! Cathy Mourningside\\'s eyes darting around really cracked me up. Something nobody mentioned was the way Gracie liked to stick her tongue out. Don\\'t know why but I think it\\'s cute. All the acting was superb. I enjoyed this movie to the max. Don\\'t know why they tried to make her look like a loser at first. That simply can\\'t be done. You could dress her in a potato sack and she would still look great.\"', '\"Great entertainment!  Sandra Bullock has grown past her other roles as she adds graceful athleticism to an already formidable repertoire.  A delightful performance from beginning to end.  This is an actor who can change personae without seeming effort from one end of the spectrum to the other.The writing is exquisitely hilarious and unpredictable, especially for a comedy with so much physical energy.  The jokes flow so fast and profusely we almost didn\\'t have time to breathe, although kids might not catch a lot of the gems as they whiz by in an ironic insider staccato.Members of my family who have been in beauty pageants laughed the hardest and longest as they recognised truth after poignant truth.And the movie keeps its delicate balance between excoriating the hypocrisy and shallowness of the promotions while acknowledging the intelligence and decency of the women who participate.We made it all the (hysterical) way home although my husband repeated funny lines all the way.Candace Bergen and Michael Caine are excellent too.\"', '\"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.Why is it that in `women\\'s films\\' women appear particularly unable to survive without a man on their side? But I don\\'t want to write a contribution to the battle of the sexes. I want to comment on this movie.I had a good laugh, I have to admit. Maybe I would have enjoyed myaself more, if there hadn\\'t been two girls sitting beside me, close to a nervous breakdown each time Hugh Grant appeared on the screen. The most stunning effort is of course Renee Zellweger\\'s courage to completely destroy her outward appearance and look like the `average woman\\' instead of a sexy super-model (I suppose, that was the idea). Hugh Grant, like him or not, has great fun in the part of the macho guy. And Colin Firth does a good job as a phlegmatic cynic, though I am not sure whether I wanted Bridget to decide for him rather than for Hugh Grant.The problem of the film is that while it is some kind of ironic response to romantic comedies, it turns out to be nothing else after some time. The ending is terrribly happy and conventional. But if you rent the film, don\\'t turn off during the end credits! You would miss the very best joke of the whole film (`My name is Ellen.\\')!\"', '\"I thought that this movie was one of the more funny movies that i\\'ve EVER seen! I will admit tho, once that you\\'ve seen the movie once, u\\'ll be hard pressed to want to see it again!I liked pretty much everything within this movie, it was funny, it had everything that you would want to see in a movie, it had gags, it had some incredible sequences and best of all.... It took the mick outta all those movies out there e.g. \"Scream\" and \"I know what you did last summer.\" I coulda loved this movie just for that alone!Now, thats not saying that i don\\'t love those movies (love them to DEATH) but i was glad when someone came along and blew the air out of these movies inflated egos! This movie doesn\\'t pretend to be anything else other than what it is, plain and simple gags, and in some cases, those gags can be very funny if you have a good memory of what happened in the movies which it was taking the mick out of!(Short spolier here!) There are some moments in the movie tho that made me want to scream because they seem in such bad taste etc. The two major ones were the toliet scene and also \"Mrs Man\" Showing her private privates scene! I didn\\'t really get the spoof of Mrs Man but with the toliet scene, oh yeh, i got it! I was just left hoping that it wasn\\'t a real \"thing\" poking outta his ear!Ahh well, this movie was something spectular in my opinion, altho i think that its one of a kind and not something that can be repeated, i hope that the seuqal is something that can be repeated.... 0=]\"', '\"Ben Stiller has shown throughout the years that he does great at starring in fun comedies, and this is no exception. Stiller stars as Greg Focker, a male nurse who is going to meet his girlfriend\\'s parents for the weekend and ask her father for approval to marry Pam, the aforementioned girlfriend. Stiller creates a character that is hilarious, believable, and one that many can relate to.Robert De Niro steals the show as Jack Byrnes, a former CIA agent who is a nice guy but has strict rules. There are times when he suspects and knows that Greg is up to no good, but is accepting of who Greg is and isn\\'t afraid to say anything. Jack likes to have fun but makes Greg nervous. Nobody can pull off the chemistry better than De Niro and Stiller do in these roles.Teri Polo plays Greg\\'s girlfriend Pam and Blythe Danner plays Jack\\'s wife Dina. They both do fine jobs but are not given a whole lot to do.Director Jay Roach takes an idea of what it\\'ll be like to spend a weekend with a girlfriend\\'s parents and makes an original story out of it. Roach is great at telling funny and heartfelt stories. Roach does an excellent job at getting the performances that he wants and is able to tell a good story.\"', '\"Please, if you ever sit home alone and are bored to death and decide  to rent this movie....Don\\'t!! Turn around and just read the book. It is SO much better! However, if you want to see a film with an awful American actress putting on an awful English accent, a terrible English actor, putting on a terrible pair of sunglasses, a weak bunch of co-stars, projecting weak one-dimensional characters, and last, but not least, THE most abysmal film fight ever, with THE most abysmal Gerri Halliwell remake of: \"It\\'s Raining Men..\" then this is the movie for you!!!\"', '\"This was the funniest spoof type movie I have ever seen. It sure knocks the socks off of Naked Gun, Airplane, Hot Shots and any other Leslie Nielson movie...a must see. Although the movie Scream was in fact a great movie, everyone knows that most horror movies are rather laughable...this brings out the best.\"', '\"This movie is hilarious, if you\\'ve seen all of the scream movies,and both I know what you did last summers.  If you\\'ve at least seen the previews for Blair witch, matrix, and sixth sense, you\\'ll be fine with the rest.  Oh yeah, and there\\'s a \"usual suspects\" reference thrown in there that you might not understand.  But if you\\'re a huge fan of those movies, you will LOVE this movie.  It mainly spoofs the scream movies, and it is unbelievably funny. Example: Deputy Dewey\\'s name is....Doofy. A mentally retarded man who gets to play as a police officer. Funny stuff.  I highly recommend it.\"', '\"I had a couple of hours to kill today and this more than did that.  It was a very pleasant way to spend the time - I laughed out loud more than a few times.  Stiller\\'s best performance yet. De Niro continues to show that he can be very comfortable in comedy roles.  A couple of old-timers (Danner and George) put in good performances.\"', '\"Ben Stiller plays fashion model Derek zoolander who is really kind of ugly but more importantly for the story, extremely dumb. I loved it when his girl friend said she was bulimic and zoo said \"You can read minds\"? The bad guys have turned him into a Manchurian candidate to kill the leader of Malaysia or Micronesia or Eurasia or Crimetia - the characters keep changing the name of the country.Ben stiller does a great job but what really surprised me was milla jovovich. I had seen her in the Fifth Element and a Joan of Arc movie and thought she was gorgeous but the world\\'s worst actress. Here she plays a black-haired villainess with red eye liner and she does a great job and is still beautiful.\"', '\"ZOOLANDER / (2001) ** (out of four)The first thing I do after watching a movie is evaluate any personal changes it made with me. A film can completely change my outlook on parts of life. Zoolander did indeed make a lasting impression.on my view of male super models. I can honestly say I\\'ll never look at another Calvin Klien billboard the same way again, but that isn\\'t exactly a towering accomplishment.\\nZoolander is not supposed to make a lasting impression; it\\'s flimsy, 90-minute escapism. Though I didn\\'t laugh very much in this nonsensical comedy either, although it does contain some funny material involving the title character\\'s stupidity, and it benefits from keeping its tongue firmly in cheek.Following the success of his blockbuster comedies \"Meet the Parents\" and \"There\\'s Something About Mary,\" Ben Stiller gathered family and friends to make Zoolander, an original, stylish satire on the fashion industry. Based on a 1996 VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards character Stiller co-created with MTV Movie Awards writer/producer Drake Sather, Zoolander is quite pleased with its unique sense of humor, but unique does not necessarily spell funny.Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, who has defended his title of Male Model of the Year for three consecutive years now, but this year his competition gets the best of him. A dashing, red-hot newcomer, Hansel (Owen Wilson) nabs the award, sending Zoolander home with nothing but a low self-image. Shocked by these and other tragic events, Derek wonders if there\\'s more to life than being \"really, really good looking.\" He returns to his Southern roots only for his coal miner father (Jon Voight) to disown him. Enter a diabolical plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, and you have yourself the visually amusing concept of Zoolander.Ben Stiller has the stuff here, as does Owen Wilson, Jon Voight, SNL veteran Will Ferrell, Jerry Stiller, and Milla Jovovich. I especially enjoyed the charismatic performance by Ben Stiller\\'s real life wife, Christine Taylor as an aggressive Time Magazine Reporter. Andy Dick, Fabio, Cuba Gooding Jr., Donald Trump, Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Billy Zane, and Garry Shandling and other big stars appear for satiric cameos. There\\'s a lot of talent involved with this film, which makes it all the more tragic that it doesn\\'t work.Ben Stiller, who also directs, writes, and producers this movie, has a lot of fun. During pre-production, Stiller and Owen Wilson spent two days being photographed by Frank Ockenfels to create model \"portfolios\" for Zoolander and Hansel. They posed in mock ad campaigns for Gucci, Perry Ellis, Tommy Hilfiger and Evian, as well as bogus magazine covers for GQ, Details, Rolling Stone, Surfer, American Way, ESPN and the International Male catalog.Filmed in New York City and Los Angeles, the film creates an enjoyable world of glamorous fashion fiction. Production designer Robin Standefer and costume designer David C. Robinson imagine lush, outrageous, exotic costumes and images that greatly contribute to character development. Even with such a complex visual arena, however, Zoolander flops. It\\'s visually entertaining, yes, but the story is not interesting, the characters one-dimensional, and the attempt at humor only occasionally makes us grimace. It\\'s dazzling, flavorful candy for our eyes, but Zoolander is all style without substance.\"', '\"The description I got of this movie before I saw it was \"think the answering machine scene from swingers (possibly the most painful scene to watch in movie history) and imagine watching it for 2 hours.\" Well, he was right, I\\'ve never cringed my way through a movie quite like I did with this, Ben Stiller is hilarious as he screws up everything imaginable and Robert Diniro is excellent. 8/10 for comedy, 10/10 for pain\"', '\"At one time I didn\\'t like Ben Stiller... silly me! His performance makes this movie painful to watch-it\\'s almost as if you were there!\\nSimilar over the top tasteless humor as found in Something About Mary -- just not quite as vulgar or extreme. A great unwind-after-the-work-week flick.\"', '\"One of the funnier movies this year and bound to become a classic, based upon the popularity of the \"Scream\" and \"I Know...\" movies.  Guaranteed laughs.  Excellent choice of actors/actresses and the Wayans brothers bring the same comedy to the screen as with their old show \"In Living Color\".\"', '\"Greg (Ben Stiller) is a regular joe trying to impress a psychotic manipulative trouble-making father-in-law to be. It seems to make matters worse, however, that he\\'s also a male nurse, jewish, and his legal name is Gaylord Focker, in this movie which is about as pleasant as taking a visit to a tooth-pulling dentist who is against using anaesthetics.The riffing on Greg\\'s name is primary-school grade humour, and has that feeling of a cheap joke, kind of that \"i can feel a song coming on\" feeling in bad musicals, just as bad is the \"we\\'re throwing in a funny line\" feeling.This is one of those movies where everything you could imagine might go wrong - does - and always to the detriment of poor Ben Stiller. By the time the resolution started happening, it was too late. There were just too many bad things that happened to Greg Focker.All this is not to say that its bad quality. Stiller hits the uncomfortable fiance thing perfectly. And the script is good - there are many moments, especially within the first half hour, that anyone who\\'s ever met the parents before can associate with. Is it enjoyable, though? No, i didn\\'t think so. Ironically, its because they draw you in so much that its so upsetting. You simply can\\'t accept these tragic situations as comedy - you feel too sorry for Greg Focker.The resolution is fairly forced and implausible.6/10. But not for me. Too sadistic.Highlight: the airline hostess at the end.\"', '\"The movie had quite a few funny moments, but the stretches between them were awfully dry.Though not a bad movie, I would not recommend it unless there is simply nothing else to watch.\"', '\"My mom is not amused by much of ANYTHING!  She laughed her head off, and was happy for the extent of the film.  That means the film was GOOD! Thanks!!!\"', '\"I was a little wary of this movie, given that I generally don\\'t fully appreciate the Wayans brothers\\' brand of humor.  But I gamely went along with my friends to watch it last night. First, this movie would have been better without the questionable material (which should have qualified it for an NC17 rating.) Second, the acting in this movie is much better than the material. Third, most of the fun in this movie comes from figuring out which movies they are spoofing or out-right ripping off.  By my count, they stole whole scenes from both the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer franchises, and peppered the movie heavily with direct and indirect references to other recent flicks, many not even of the horror genre: American Beauty, Matrix, Very Bad Things, American Pie, even Michael Flatley\\'s Lord of the Dance (or was that Riverdance?) And I believe the bathroom scene with the male organ could have been a reference to the famous shower scene from Porky\\'s, but I might be reading too much into it.And yet, this movie reminds me of a Woody Allen routine about life being like airline food -- it\\'s bad, and they don\\'t give you enough.  Yes, some of the humor is strained, and most is juvenile... but the movie is also too short (run time claims to be 88 minutes, but it must have some really long credits, because we were in and out of the theatre in 85 minutes, including the coming attractions.)  Bottom line is that I wish I had seen it at a second-run theatre for $1, or at least at a matinee -- it\\'s worth seeing if you like picking out pop culture references, or if you\\'re really into juvenile humor, but it isn\\'t worth the $7 or $8 most theatres get for an evening showing.\"', '\"\"Miss Congeniality\" has its moments of lameness.  The beauty pageant contestants are reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes, which is not offensive but pretty dull.  And most of the supporting cast is one-dimensional, though some are amusing.  I liked Michael Caine as the pageant consultant.  Bill Shatner looks like a total cartoon, but considering the roles he\\'s taken after quitting \"Star Trek\"--this is a high point.  And of course, Sandra Bullock shines as usual.  She was perfectly suited in her role as a tomboy, and I like how her character didn\\'t fade out, even after the arduous makeover.  She definitely shows off her knack for physical comedy more than she has in her past comedies.It\\'s hard to find a perfect comedy nowadays, so naturally this movie misses the mark here and there--the running joke of Bullock tripping on high heels wasn\\'t funny at first, and it wasn\\'t necessary to repeat it again and again. But when the movie hits the mark--it does it successfully!  I have to admit, I received lots of big laughs!  And overall, this is just a fun movie--emphasize the word \"fun.\"  There are many implausible elements that those who carry a notepad to the cinema will so graciously scribble down, but if you\\'re not part of the crowd I suspect you\\'ll have a ball.My score:  7 (out of 10)\"', '\"the movie\\'s just plain hilarious... since it IS a spoof, you might want to make sure you\\'ve seen scream 1 and 2, i know what you did 1 and 2, the matrix, usual suspects, american pie.. or you won\\'t get the full bodied flavor you deserve.\"', '\"Some funny parts--better after the beginning--but vastly inferior to the movie it ripped off--1980\\'s \"The In-Laws.\"  The \"In-Laws\", starring Peter Falk (\"Columbo\") and Alan Arkin, may be the funniest movie of all time.  I am not some old codger who saw \"The In-Laws\" in a theatre and is waxing about old times.  I am thirty, meaning I was eight when \"The In-Laws\" came out.  I saw it for the first time on cable.  But I know greatness when I see it, wherever I see it.  \"Meet The Parents\" aint great.  \"The In-Laws\" is. It will make you laugh as much or more than practically any movie you have ever seen. See that, not this.  (In case you haven\\'t figured it out, the plots of the two movies are very similar.)\"', '\"I\\'m not going to lie, I\\'m a little mad I missed the day of Sandra Bullock rom-coms. She\\'s done great work over the last 7-10 years but it\\'s too few and far between and I can\\'t remember the last true rom-com she\\'s done. I was far too young to see Miss Congeniality when it was released, which makes it more impressive that *for the most part* the film holds up well. I can\\'t defend some of the jokes or sexism clearly shown by Gracie\\'s colleagues. But I enjoyed Bullock\\'s \\'transformation\\' and her dual role, she\\'s always had a keen knack for timely physical humor - see Heat for example. The follows similar romantic beats and deploys more cliches than it needs to, but it works well enough. And hey, I will always be open to more Michael Caine, especially in roles he doesn\\'t typically play.7.0/10\"', '\"Miss Congeniality is one of the best movies I\\'ve seen in a while.  It is a good, clean, and hilarious movie!  Sandra Bullock is at her best!  This is a terrific date movie!  I went and bought it and my husband and I absolutely loved it!\"', '\"\"Scary movie\". Very appropriate title. This movie scares the crap out of me because it reminds me about how rancid the movie business has become lately. This is a movie made for those kind of people who were too stupid to understand what \"The Naked Gun\" series was all about. My favourite hate-object, Anna Farris somehow managed to get the leadrole (I\\'m pretty sure how, but I can\\'t tell you why, in risk of getting sued), and she manages to screw it up pretty good and she\\'s still the best actor here. The jokes are not only dumb but they\\'re so incredibly lame that it will make you want to burn everyone responsible for this tripe on the stakes. The reason it actually gets a 3 is because it has some funny gags. But then again, there are thousands of movies with better and more jokes. Go watch them instead.3/10\"', '\"Wish it would have stayed a little closer to the book and put in more of the fun stuff that happened in between her and her friends. But I still think they did a GREAT job and I hope that there is a sequaile to it and that if they do that it has all about her trip in it.\"', '\"This is without doubt the unfunniest, vilest, most revolting film I have ever seen.  The script appears to have been written during a drunken frat party - it is puerile, misogynistic and offensive.  I had to go home and take a shower after seeing it.  If you credit yourself with having any taste at all, give this one a miss.\"', '\"This film was a very lame attempt at been humorous. The jokes were poor, overcooked and could be seen at least two lines before hand. I didn\\'t have a decent laugh during the whole movie and was sorry I wasted my time viewing it until the end. The worst thing about this type of baloney is that a new genre of film seems to have been invented by some studios i.e. \"unfunny\" funny film whose only reason for existence is to lull the viewing audience into some sort of trite \"twilight zone\", letting them think that they go home in a jovial and entertained mood where the exact opposite is the case as the discerning viewer goes home unfulfilled, cheated and slightly disgruntled. Unfortunately, we have been exposed to a plethora of these films for too long as more and more of this type of banal movie is served up appealing to increasingly demoralized audiences as certain movie makers lose sight of the hilarious belly busters of yesteryear with their razor sharp script writers, ludicrous plots and acting beyond belief. They have become nothing more that \"cash cows\" for some actors to make a few extra dollars to keep them in the lifestyle that they have been accustomed to and are disingenuous to both, us their audience, and true comedians alike.\"', '\"It\\'s obviously going to be tough for a movie like this to appeal to me: I maintain that this film is better tailored for American audiences. But seriously, this is really awful. A terrible excuse for a movie.If you\\'re looking for a horror spoof, go with Psycho Beach Party or Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday The 13th instead. Both of them are much funnier and don\\'t have the distasteful nasty streak that was present here. The likes of Billy\\'s orgasm scene and Cindy flashing her [somewhat deformed] breasts are some of the many moments in which this Scary movie crossed the fine line between the wearisome and the unwatchable.I could keep going. I could move onto the quality of the acting, the pathetic writing, the failed spoofs (turning The Matrix into Riverdance... what were they thinking?), but I just want this review to end. I\\'m going to stop here.Now let us never speak of Scary Movie again. EVER.Grade: D-\"', '\"This is simply the best movie comedy I have seen this year.  If it had a point to it, some deeper meaning, it would be in my running for best movie of the year.Put simply, this movie is one giant situation comedy without much anything more to say.  The gags are logical, but in no way truly predictable (i.e. you know *exactly* what\\'s going to happen, to the very detail).  Granted, if you\\'re really looking that far in advance for it, you\\'re going to find it -- though you\\'re not really enjoying the movie.  Overall, no cheap laughs, everyone is hard earned and set up nicely and logically.MTP generates a lot of laughs without being crude (unless you consider the play on last names).  It truly blew my expectations away.  The preview does not do this movie justice.  Even when I recognized some of the bits from the preview, they were funnier in the movie (except maybe the polygraph test, which is about the same).  There was no sap, no cheesey moments, save for the end, which tidies things up nicely.  Normally, I have no place in movie for those types of scenes, but this movie makes no attempts to say anything more anyway, so it is excusable.Watch this movie.  It destroys Scary Movie (vulgar and crude, \"so stupid it has to be funny\") in terms of sheer hilarity.  I also rate MTP above There\\'s Something About Mary, and American Pie because, again, it does not have to lower its standards to get cheap laughs.  Also, the pace is much better than these other movies.  The timing is excellent, with plenty of logical humor as well as physical hilarity.\"', '\"Yes, I\\'m one of those weirdos who saw the second movie first and then rented the first movie afterward. This film isn\\'t as funny as its\\' successor but it\\'s cleaner. However, my only complaint is that Owen Wilson overplays his character, Kevin. The character of Kevin himself is quite unrealistic.Still, that doesn\\'t mean the movie is bad. It\\'s quite good actually. It\\'s just that \"Meet the Fockers\" is a lot funnier than this one. Robert DeNiro is fitting as his role as Jack Byrnes, Greg\\'s future (psycho) father-in-law.And it\\'s also worth the rental price, too.\"', '\"Robert De Niro is more or less a Walther Matthau-character is this comedy and it is surprising, even refreshing that he - as an actor and a co-producer of this film - wants to do a classic screwball-film. Even taxidrivers get older, one must realize. And when they do, they want to entertain on the good old family playground. It is in many ways an old-fashioned film, well acted and nice to relax to. One may not be wiser on the mysteries of neither life nor love after watching it, but some time has been killed in a very humane way.\"', '\"When they made Hot Shots! and HS Part Deux! they succeded. At first theysucceded with some of the movies of Leslie Nielsen as well. The reasonwas that they worked the script through, probably - that is.<p> However, Scary Movie stinks. This is <b>the worst garbage</b> I have ever wasted my money on renting. It is so bad that I don\\'t have wordslow enough to give an ample description of it.<p> If this is supposed to be talent, then watch out world!!! Because thenreal talent is down for the count, maybe even gutted and bleeding toit\\'s death. Don\\'t do the stupid thing I did. Don\\'t rent this movie.<p>\"', '\"This film wasn\\'t awful, but it was far from being good.  I love Robert DeNiro, but I find it embarrassing and stupid to see him in these idiotic comedy roles he now seems to be taking up all the time.  \\'Analyze This\\' was rubbish, and he has such good presence in serious films. I don\\'t know why he bothers with these stupid films.  Watch something wonderful, like \\'Taxi Driver\\' instead.\"', '\"Just awful.  I love a good parody, and for the 10 minutes that this movie was parodying, it was all right.  Unfortunately, those ten minutes were shown on trailers and ads, so it was nothing new.  The rest is just puerile humor more appropriate for a group of 7th grade boys.  Frankly, the whole thing makes Biodome and similar movies seem subtle by comparison.\"', '\"The Whole Nine Yards: Ever wonder why the suicide rate among dentists is so high?  I\\'m convinced it\\'s because they spend all day rooting around in people\\'s mouths.  Now imagine that you are Nick \"Oz\" Oseransky: in addition to being a mouth spelunker you are trapped in a loveless marriage with a chain-smoking-money-sucking-leech-of-a-wife, you have a live-in mother-in law who you\\'re convinced knows Satan on a personal basis and you\\'re struggling to pay off debts left by your good for nothing ex-partner and father-in-law. Just when Oz thinks he\\'s hit rock bottom, he gets a new neighbour, but not just any neighbour: this guy happens to be an infamous contract killer who ratted out his former employers and just got out of prison. And he wants to be friends.  It would be enough to make anyone jump in front of a busThis is a dark, slapstick romantic comedy that falls somewhere in between \"Prizzi\\'s Honor\" and \"Analyze This\" with a bit of \"Say Anything\" thrown in for good luck.  Matthew Perry is hilarious as Oz, the stressed out bumbling schmuck who finds himself in an impossible situation. Perry\\'s physical comedy continues to improve with every picture and this is his best big screen performance to date.  It was also refreshing to see Bruce Willis return to the wise cracking tough guy character that he does so well (especially after the disastrous \"The Story of Us\").   The supporting cast also worked well - Kevin Pollack was amusing as the Verbally dyslexic Hungarian gangster and Amy Peet positively glowed as the quirky dental assistant.  It would be interesting to see how the audience perceived Michael Duncan - here a ruthless killer- when they saw the second half of the special double feature -\"The Green Mile\".My sole complaint would have to be Rosanne Arquette\\'s character.  Don\\'t misunderstand me, I have nothing against scheming evil women, but her Quebecois accent was positively dreadful. I don\\'t know if this was meant for comic effect, but every time she started to talk they couldn\\'t end the scene quick enough for me.That quibble aside, this is a well-acted funny movie with some interesting twists and worth the price of  admission.\"', '\"Sure that this is a movie you can live without and in some weeks you even won\\'t remember one bloody second of it, but still an enjoyable movie just because it\\'s a bit fresher than most of the comedies we are seeing today. Sandra Bullock steals the show completely (perhaps her best role ever) as she plays the anti-woman who is an FBI-cop but then her worst nightmare comes across when she has to go undercover for some election from Miss America. It leads into quite silly situations that will make you laugh and even if the plot is pure Hollywoodnonsense (and not exactly the cherry on the pie), it\\'s quite enjoyable.

Unlike the aforementioned, this one tries to toss in some drama and intrigue. It all comes off as believable, as finding the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.The talent involved is immense, and it has some good moments. Mafia comedies haven\\'t been too hot lately (MAFIA! or THE GODSON-1998...WATCH THESE AT YOUR OWN PERIL), and this one is way above the norm. Yet, it throws too much on the plate to keep in balance. Matthew Perry\\'s character becomes irritating after awhile, and he simply doesn\\'t come across an earnest dupe. Bruce Willis, Natasha Henstridge and Michael Clarke Duncan are in firm control of their characters, and despite the script, give good performances.\\nWhile the WHOLE NINE YARDS attempts farce, the lack of support from the script undermines its efforts. The overall effect was tepid.\"', '\"Ben Stiller (Meet the parents) stars as Derek Zoolander, a confident but stupid male model who loses his crown to Hansel (Wilson) and decides to take time off to search for something else, only fashion mastermind Mugatu (Ferrell) has his own plans for Derek.This 2001 comedy directed by Stiller is sharp, funny and bizarre, a very good combination and one of the most delightful surprises of the noughties.Having portrayed many weird yet wonderful characters in his career, Stiller again dives deep into his best quality, that daft and humorous side that his fans love and he does so in such a way to make the film very enjoyable. Many performances of his have always been fairly repetitive, however with the type of jokes encoded and his direction does it come off and with the support, can we see a true energetic performance. The quality of direction is good, using a variety of shots and techniques to get the weird and wonderful messages across.Successful support is given by Owen Wilson (Wedding crashers) and Will Ferrell (Blades of Glory) all comedians with a similar style and combining recognized comedy actors justifies the genre and gives a clear message to audience about the life of these characters.Though the plot is predictable, daft and utterly a bizarre portrayal of what really happens in the fashion industry, you just have to sit back and enjoy it anyway. Too many films these days, particularly comedies, are made with no depth and hardly any funny jokes and predictable written underneath the title, for example The Heartbreak Kid. But sometimes they work, this script is sharp, and actually is funny with physical and other types of humour used to justify the needs of the viewing public, bring back this style of comedy.There will be shaking of the head moments and turning to look at the wall when one of the clichÃ©s appear but for the most part, Zoolander is sharply written, a completely daft yet enjoyable comedy that does work and is perhaps the best performance by Stiller in his long and established career.\"', '\"Zoolander is not comedy perfection, nor is it a total waste of space. In fact it comes in just above average because when it is funny, it is laugh out loud funny. Not surprisingly, when you have Ben Stiller turning in another great performance! He is a bit of a master at this type of role though and some may say that it gets tiring seeing the same kind of humour being churned out again and again. People were turning against Jim Carrey and Robin WIlliams for the same comedy showcases again and again before they defied expectations and went against the grain. It shows that they can do more than just comedy and gain a betetr critical reception for it!! Anyway back to the subject - Zoolander is a little reminiscent of the Austin POwers movies with its over the top set pieces and pantomimic villains however it works when the storyline is just as ridiculous!Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a male model who\\'s star is falling whilst OWen Wilson (Stiller\\'s regular sidekick) rises to international fame as Hansel, the stealer of Zoolander\\'s Male MOdel OF The Year crown. They are both portrayed as stupid himbos who have to rely on the brains of a female Time Magazine reporter when Zoolander is brainwashed to kill the Malaysian prime minister by a villainous fashion designer (Will Ferrell, deliciously camp). Part of the joy of this film is watching out for the cameo appearances..Jon Voight, Winona Ryder and Builly Zane have larger roles whilst you can also see Victoria BEckham, Paris HIlton on the down side!! The scene when Zoolanders mermaid advert is screened in a miners village with his dad and brothers [present is priceless and probably my favourite part of the film but also look out for the calendar and the MAgnum...You will be trying hard not to laugh..Give it a go. Great performances, lively show pieces, a good soundtrack and it aint exactly a long film film - 80 minutes! whats wrong with a bit of familiarity now and again anyway?\"', '\"Derek Zoolander is a dim-witted, but well meaning male model who is brainwashed into a plot to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia.

It\\'s a ridiculous but fun movie. It\\'s one of those movies that you can pull out on a rainy day for sh**s and giggles. But at the same time, it\\'s not overly hilarious of its own accord. You laugh because the movie is silly, not because the jokes are ingeniously funny. It\\'s completely random, it\\'s full of plot holes and stereotypes, and overall - it\\'s a stupid film, but it means well.

I was wrong. This was a first for me; my first DVD in which I had no desire to check out any of the extras on the disk. Indeed, I found myself calculating the remaining time during the last half of the film.Renee Zelwegger was fine, but the role was demeaning and sitcom-like.(spoiler) Typical is when she arrives at what she believes will be a costume party, only to find everyone dressed. Not only does everyone look at her with their noses in the air (curious, since they were all told last minute that the \\'tarts\\' theme was off), she does not explain, and does not pull off the bunny head and tail.Colin Firth is supposedly the good guy, the one we want her to end up with, but he goes around pouting and angry and miserable and bitter through most of the film. Really endearing.Hugh Grant is good, but (spoler2) his betrayal of her is so formulaic. Yawn. The fistfight scene with Firth is embarrassingly bad and could have been written by any 1st year film student.Is this what we\\'ve come to? This is what\\'s passing as great entertainment?

Just a few minor problems:  I think they should have made it more plausible for Gracie to get into the top 10. Recall that they were going to fix the pageant, but the fix was canceled when the other agents left, so she had to get into the top 10 on her merits, and did so, even though up to that point in the pageant she had made a total ass of herself.  After she made the top 10 her behavior improved greatly, and it was almost believable for her to be #2, but they could have made her improve sooner to make it more plausible.BTW, people describe this as an ugly-duckling-becomes-a-swan story, but I didn\\'t see that happen.

So if you\\'re not going to see it because you dont wanna see gross stuff just close your eyes on those parts the rest is fine. It was good though I wouldn\\'t recommend it to NE one under the age of 11. This is a parody of alot a movies, Scream Series, Sixth Sense, I know what you did series, Halloween H20(Buffy dragging on the ground after leg incident),Blair Witch, Matrix and Usual Suspects. So if you\\'ve seen all of these movies you can quickly recognize some funny s**t. AS to the reference it was racist the only part I thought was even border line but definitely was not racist is when the news guy goes \"White folks are dead we gettin the f*** outa here\" and Shorty(Waynes) is a druggie but there\\'s white guys right there next to him smokin pot.

He plays Greg Focker, a male nurse who loves Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He wants to marry her with her father\\'s permission. He hasn\\'t met her parents yet. The movie shows us the weekend where Stiller meets the parents. Pam\\'s father is Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother is Dina (Blythe Danner). The more Greg tries to impress the parents, especially Jack who is a former CIA-agent, the more he humiliates himself. Not only with his actions, also with his words and stupid lies to look better.Stiller is perfect in this kind of role. We already saw that, especially in \\'There\\'s Something About Mary\\'. The more he gets in trouble, the more painful it gets, the better Stiller gets and the more we laugh. There is also a fine little part from Owen Wilson as Pam\\'s former lover. Stiller and Wilson have made a lot of films together and for some reason their scenes always work, they at least make you smile. De Niro doesn\\'t try very hard to be a strict person who doesn\\'t give Greg a chance and therefore succeeds even better. The way he slowly gets harder and harder on Greg is good for a new laugh every time. \\'Meet the Parents\\', directed by Jay Roach who also directed the \\'Austin Powers\\' trilogy, is a fine comedy with a lot of sequences where you might feel a little uncomfortable.\"', '\"To say \\'Miss Congeniality\\' is brain-numbingly predictable is to give it an element of surprise it never even thought about having.

Sandra Bullock is Gracie Hart, an impossibly shlumpy young FBI agent who has, her entire life, suffered from the Ugly Duckling syndrome. A letter from the \\'the Citizen\\', a mass-murderer, leads the Feds to believe his next target will be the Miss United States pageant. And of course they\\'ll need an agent to go undercover. And of course it will be Gracie. They reckon she\\'s the only one who\\'ll look half-decent in a bathing suit, so despite her recent screw-up during an arrest, they send her to a pageant consultant (Michael Caine). The typical transformation into Swan commences, and there is, of course, a cute guy (Benjamin Bratt) who never really noticed her before but suddenly realizes she looks pretty nice in a miniskirt. Burdened with a weak script with little to recommend it but plenty of straggling plot points, the movie is still not without a few positive qualities. The performances are good enough, the jokes are cute enough, Sandy Bullock is beautiful and a good physical comedienne. There\\'s nothing wrong with any of that. The problem is that this same movie has been made about 3 dozen times under different titles in the past couple of years alone. And it\\'s been made better. If you are a Sandy fan, happen to love makeover movies or are in the mood for one while in the video store, by all means give \\'Miss Congeniality\\' a try. If you are looking for a movie with so much as a scrap of originality, though, give it a pass.\"', '\"This movie certainly cheers you up after you watch it. The acting was quite bad but it was like they meant it to be bad. Some might say that this movie is plain stupid. I think they meant to be stupid and it was very funny. This one is a parody of Scream. I must say that some of the humour is very crude so if you don\\'t like that sort of comedy then this movie is definitely not for you. I thought Anna Farris did a good job as Cindy Campbell. This movie is great if you compare it to other parody movies however if you compare it to other normal movies it\\'s obviously not that good. What they say most of the time is quite rude but it is expected. I recommend it if you want to have a laugh and forget about your problems.\"', '\"A pretty smart film that masquerades as a spoof of male fashion (who needed to spoof that, anyway) but is really a satire of Western culture on some levels.  On other levels, it\\'s mostly straightforward physical comedy, but there is enough visual quality and the actors are also good, so this is well pulled off.  Stiller is over the top as the model who uncovers an international cartel who use male models to assassinate world leaders (this is all in the first 30 minutes, folks).  He appears in many scenes with his father, and their chemistry is excellent.  Ferrell is excellent and also way over the top as the cartel\\'s lead muscle man/world famous designer.  There were 2 really funny scenes I don\\'t want to give away, but what really cracked me up here was how straight Jon Voight played his character, and it is his character if you know what I mean.  The movie never took a blink from a straight approach to his \"I\\'m a rugged coal miner whose son is a flamboyant male model\" role, and I applaud it for its judgement.Not a great movie that it perhaps aimed to be, but easily the best mainstream American comedy I\\'ve seen since \"Austin Powers\".\"', '\"Creud,lewd and just plain unfunny. These are just three of the words I\\'d use to describe this film.To call it family entertainment is laughable - in fact it\\'s probably the only laugh you\\'ll get. Stiller and co can do better than this and yet seem quite happy to be dragged into this horrible film and its two sequels.The only people who would find this funny are immature teenagers with nothing better to do. Every joke is signposted and even then are boring.If this is what passes for entertainment then I despair. It is a very poor film.\"', '\"OK, now I\\'m just checking, comedies are supposed to make you laugh right??? I\\'m just making sure, because I wasn\\'t 100% positive after seeing this.... OK so in a nutshell, I\\'m going to explain scary movie to you, it\\'s a poor attempt at comedy, that is FILLED with non-stop sex, nudity, and cuss words. I found the gags very offensive and just over-used!! Scream face smoking weed!! Seriously is that the best they could do? The Wayne Bros. Need an early retirement. This just wasn\\'t funny! I found it very hard to watch at some parts, because it was just sooo offensive and crude!!! It\\'s middle school potty humor, and I would hope that our filmmakers can do better than this!!\"', '\"Scary Movie was very disgusting but very funny! I was laughing the whole time- even at the parts that grossed me out so much I couldn\\'t look! I can\\'t wait to see it again! I definitely recommend this movie! But if you think it\\'s too gross, don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.\"', '\"I believe that just because the film had a combination of action, comedy, and a bit of romance does not make it bad.  The film was really funny and there was hardly a dull moment where you felt like you could fall asleep. Sandra Bullock played her role as an FBI agent pretty well and her humor helped the movie to make it even better.  I don\\'t care what the movie critics had to say- I liked it.\"', '\"Sandra Bullock has been known to be a little \\'typecast\\' sometimes â€“ always playing the \\'loveable, but kooky\\' leading lady. Okay, so despite a few attempts to move away from that image, \\'loveable and kooky\\' is what she does best. And she does it very well here.In \\'Miss Congeniality\\' she plays an FBI agent who has to go undercover in the Miss America beauty contest in order to protect its participants from someone threatening the event. I recently watched the X-files â€“ another show centring on FBI agents. I couldn\\'t help but laugh at the difference the \\'Bureau\\' is portrayed in both shows. In the X-files they\\'re all serious and professional, in \\'Miss Congeniality\\' they kind of behave like frat boys at a college party.But then that\\'s what Miss Congeniality is. It\\'s not meant to be taken seriously, nor does it ever try. It\\'s one of those perfect films that you can simply sit down and relax with. You won\\'t need much brainpower to appreciate it. Sandra Bullock is as lovable and endearing as she always is and you won\\'t care that the whole concept is kind of silly. How anyone fails to notice that Sandra Bullock isn\\'t attractive, just because she wears glasses and doesn\\'t brush her hair is beyond me!Although Bullock naturally carries the show as she\\'s transformed from \\'tom-boy FBI agent\\' to glamorous beauty queen (a process that can apparently be achieved overnight â€“ but, again, never mind, eh?), it\\'s worth noting that Michael Caine also has a role to play. He comes close to stealing every scene as the uptight Englishman the FBI have employed to mould her into \\'Miss New Jersey.\\' There are no surprises plot-wise. You\\'ll probably guess who the bad guys â€“ really â€“ are and there\\'s the natural romantic sub-plot thrown in, just because. But, as long as you\\'re only looking for pure entertainment, you probably won\\'t care.This is a great movie to watch with other people. Sit back, crack open the popcorn, put your brain on hold and enjoy. Miss Congeniality is a classic in its own, laid back, easy-going league. No, it\\'ll never be remembered in the same breath as the true cinematic greats, such as the Godfather etc, but then it\\'s not meant to be. Just remember that while you\\'re watching Sandra stumble into things and trip over on her heels.\"', '\"I noticed that some people have said that the gags in this movie are unfunny and predictable... they complained about not very many laugh-out-loud gags. I completely disagree.This movie is one of the smartest comedies of the last few years. It does not rely on gross-out gags (like Something About Mary, etc...) and still manages to be hilarious. All of the humor is contained in the intelligence of the writing and the tenseness of the situations in the movie. Yes, you feel very sorry for Greg, but it feels OK in this movie to laugh at his expense.When I initially saw the previews for this movie a few years ago I had no desire to see it, as it seemed like it would be just like any other generic comedy. I only ended up seeing it because I had nothing better to do some random Friday night. I was very pleasantly surprised!This movie is not at all a generic comedy. The gags are brilliantly crafted and completely original. I think that people who think this movie is generic do not appreciate intelligent, non-bathroom humor. The praying scene and Jack\\'s poem at the dinner table are brilliant. Also Greg\\'s run-in with the flight attendant is great.Maybe the thing that really did it for me in this movie is that, despite their weirdness, Pam\\'s family is completely believable and real. I actually know people like that. There is a whole culture of upper-class people who really do behave like the Byrnes family in this movie. I thought it was hilarious that the movie was making fun of that culture (I am also reminded of the groom\\'s family in My Big Fat Greek Wedding). That part really struck home with me and made the movie even more funny.Great movie! Not generic at all! Very original and laugh-out-loud funny.\"', '\"As a lot of comedies, Zoolander is disappointing and doesn\\'t live up to the expectation.The story is rather enjoyable to follow and the fashion theme was interesting and had potential, but it isn\\'t crazy enough and the gags, too rare and not enough striking, struggle to crack the viewer a smile which is prohibitive for a comedy, some are actually really bad.Apart from Mugatu played by the inevitable and always excellent Will Ferrell, the characters lack consistency, a characteristic that, in the end, applies well to the movie in its entirety. Let\\'s hope Zoolander 2 will be a lot more crazy.\"', '\"Typical (what I like to call) brain-dead entertainment. You think: \"How can one person be so totally stupid\", but it is so funny that you actually wouldn\\'t mind seeing it again and again. Could definitely be in the same class as Austin Powers\"', '\"\\'Male Models\\' is an easy target for some cheap shots, and at times, \\'Zoolander\\' delivers well. Then again, at other times...Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and Hansel (Owen Wilson) are two rivalling models who find themselves in some sort of killing-all-the-world-leaders scheme, which apparently is part of the Male Modeling job. They\\'re being helped out of the mess by Matilda (Christine Taylor), a reporter for Time magazine.Funny at times, though nowhere near the recent Stiller-Wilson team-up Starsky and Hutch. As my summary says: it\\'s all pretty average.5/10.\"', '\"Sandra Bullock, beautiful (maybe not in the beginning of the movie), funny and a very good actress. Probably the best actress (well maybe because its my favourite actress) that they could choose for the job.Of all the transformation movies out there, like The Matrix (by the way, my best Si-Fi Action), My Fair Lady (not a fan of old movies), Inspector Gadget (the worst of them all), She\\'s All That, etc. I think this was the best comedy one of them all.  I\\'m not very good at this comment thing (my first time and English is not my first language, I\\'m from South Africa and Afrikaans is my first language), but I\\'ve seen allot of movies (close to 300 movies a year) and this movie kept me interested and laughing the whole way through. Well done to Donald Petrie, Marc Lawrence II and Katie Ford for a wonderful movie!!!\"', '\"Pretty good, pretty funny, but why so many penises, and not one full view of a female breast or buns?  Just doesn\\'t make sense, I think it\\'s fine that more movies are showing the penis but to show so many without views of naked female genitalia or breasts is just wrong.  The South Park Movie had one life like penis and some cartoon female flesh so it was ok.  I just think there needs to be more balance.  If you have too many penises it\\'s gay (not that there is anything WRONG with that but if I want gay porn I would know where to look & not have to find it in a comedy spoof).\"', '\"I did laugh a handful of times during this movie but, at the moment, I don\\'t remember when.  A totally banal and insipid comedy with labored setups and meager payoffs.  Nearly every punchline is predictable and, thus, spoiled. Spoofs of \"The Matrix\", \"The Usual Suspects\", and that idiotic \"Whassup?\" beer commercial are just plain dull.  And whenever the filmmakers run out of material they rely on their secret weapon--male genitalia!I really have to rank this spoof below the likes of \"Spy Hard\", \"Loaded Weapon I\" and \"Fatal Instinct\".\"', '\"I was very excited to see this movie and finally found the DVD at the video store after looking for a couple of weeks. I wish that I hadn\\'t wasted my time searching. The Wayans family is a very funny one but they seem not to be able to get their act together since \"In Living Color.\" I am not one of those people who criticize a comedy because the story is dumb or the acting isn\\'t Oscar caliber, I love a good parody. This film however did not even come close to my expectations. There were a few genuinely funny moments, but overall the film was a stinker. I think the idea of making fun of the recent rash of horror films is a great idea, but this one never gets off the ground. Perhaps the Wayans\\' failed to realize that \"Scream\" was Wes Craven\\'s tribute to the predictable, rehashed horror movies of the 1980\\'s. It was a parody in itself. I hope the sequel is better, but with all of their hits so far, I\\'m not getting my hopes up.\"', '\"\"Bridget Jones Diary\" has been a book on my shelf ever since it was first released  and I\\'ve enjoyed re-reading it many times. I was so excited to hear about the film being made. I have to admit, when I first heard about who was playing Bridget I got this awful feeling. However, I\\'m glad I was VERY wrong. Renee is Bridget to the core; insecure, clumsy, terminally unlucky and absolutely hilarious. Colin Firth just had to be Mark Darcy and doesn\\'t disappoint. Hugh Grant was also a brilliant (but not entirely unexpected) choice for Daniel.I laughed and laughed through this film, admittedly as a hard core fan of the book I was disappointed that some of the plot of changed or was cut out completely. However, the film stands alone and works really well. Men and women of all ages seemed to be enjoying it equally and I am really hoping they make a film of the Sequel book \"The Edge of Reason\" ... it\\'d be fantastic.\"', '\"\"Meet The Parents\" is a movie that must be seen with a group of friends to get the most mileage out of it. Anything that can go wrong goes wrong when Greg Fokker (Ben Stiller) meets his father in law (Robert De Niro). I thought it was really sweet the way Greg tried proposing to his fiance with the group of school children holding up signs \"Will you Marry Me?\" and it was really funny when the kids had trouble spelling it. Every time (Robert De Niro) calls greg by his last name \"Fokker\" it brought me to a whole new round of tears and laughter. This movie has something for everybody and it\\'s about time a movie came out poking fun of things that all of must go through - to MEET THE PARENTS! If you have\\'nt seen it go run out and get it - you\\'ll love it!!!\"', '\"Although this film will probably not win any awards or raves from the critics, I thought it accomplished what it apparently set out to do ... provide some light entertainment and a few good laughs. A good choice for a Friday evening after a hard week, when you really don\\'t want to be challenged. I gave it an 8.\"', '\"There\\'s Something About Mary, The Matrix, Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and The Blair Witch Project. These are just some of the many movies that get parodied and parodied some more. No movie or celebrity is safe from the Wayan Brothers as they form some sort of plot out of many, many different movies of many different genres. This movie gets a lot of flak from critics and the general public. Most of it is because it is extremely crude and low-brow humour and let\\'s face it, it is just that. There are fart jokes, sex jokes, drugs, racist jokes. You name them, they\\'re there.Cindy (Anna Faris) while driving with her friends hit a body on Halloween. They dump his body only to have him stalk them a year later, or is it him? Cindy and her group of wacky friends: Brenda (Regina Hall), Shorty (Marlon Wayans), Buffy (Shannon Elizabeth), Bobby (Jon Abrahams) and Ray (Shawn Wayans) all have to solve this mystery before the killer wipes them out.All the actors in this may not be Oscar winners but they all give great comic performances. They are all funny and it\\'s partly due to the actors because they all seem to like their roles. They go the full nine yards to gross out with many odd gags (Ms. Mann the funniest).To anyone thats looking for a hilarious parody that just doesn\\'t take itself seriously, Scary Movie is that one.3Â½/5.\"', '\"Mediocre parodies of great scary movies glued together with childish humor. The teens simply don\\'t have any other character traits than being dumb and eager to have sex with anything their age. Most people in the movie are occupied with mainly sex and gore. The killer is too stupid to be true.The humor consists of underwear, farts, senseless violence which happens ofscreen anyway and kilos of stupidity. Even Leslie Nielsen can do this better.You\\'d better be on some serious good drugs before watching this movie. Although I\\'d think I\\'d turn around and rather watch the wall and maybe bang my head on it and enjoy the stars.\"', '\"Maybe they should have changed the title to Funny Movie. This movie truly is funny, I was laughing so much! I don\\'t usually laugh at movies and something has to be really funny to make me laugh. I loved the movie, although there can be some sick moments, making me turn my head.\"', '\"My friend told me that this film was hilariously funny, he has a weird sense of humour at times, but he is not usually wrong.I cant really make my mind up about zoolander though, I thought it was a bit of a let down on the story line, a bit more things going on wouldnt have made the film too messy, just more interesting.The acting is great, Ben Stiller has definitely gone up in my books since I have watched this.If you want a nice chilled out, relaxing film that you can sit back to watch and not have to think about too much but will make you chuckle a bit, then this film is great.\"', '\"When I first heard about this film, I had my doubts Robert De Niro could do comedy. His previous work has never really embraced the art of slapstick. But I\\'m happy to say he pulled this particular role off in spades. Meet the Parents and Midnight Run are among his finest comedies because of the way they skillfully avoid conventional clichÃ©s. It begins with male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller, and yes, Focker is his actual name) wanting to propose to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). But just as he\\'s about to pop the question, he learns her sister Debbie is about to get married. But her fiancÃ© asked her father\\'s permission first, so Greg decides to do the same before he marries Pam.He uses Debbie\\'s wedding as an opportunity to meet Pam\\'s parents, where he can ask for permission. So far, so good. But things quickly take a downward spiral for Greg. Pam\\'s father Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) takes an instant dislike to Greg, (being a male nurse doesn\\'t help matters) and in his eyes, Greg can\\'t do a thing right.Much to Greg\\'s consternation, Jack was in the CIA for 34 years. Jack is an expert at spotting lies, and Greg\\'s eagerness to please leads him to tell harmless white lies that balloon into an elaborate web of lies. They become so elaborate (Greg is a dab-hand at cat-milking) even Greg can\\'t keep up with them. Because of this, every attempt he makes to please Jack backfires in a spectacular fashion.From losing the cat, Mr Jinks (who Jack is crazy about), to burning down the wedding altar, Greg is a potential accident waiting to happen. The reason I like Meet the Parents is because it\\'s one of those rare comedies that has everything. Ben Stiller does an excellent job trying to appear like a suitable husband to be, and making a complete mess of things (the dinner table scene is a definite highlight). Not to mention how hilarious it is watching Greg back himself into corners and then trying to squirm his way out of them.Robert De Niro is also excellent, using his trademark sinister characteristics to great effect when judging Greg. They both have a terrific chemistry, and every gag in the film is tailor-made for their talents. A lot of people can relate to Greg in this film, because of meeting prospective parents to be and how to relate to them properly. A lot of their \"heart to hearts\" are hilarious, especially the way they degenerate into nightmarish situations for Greg:\"Right now look Focker. I\\'m a patient man. That\\'s what 19 months in a Vietnamese prison camp will do to you. Now I will be watching you. Studying your every move. And if I find that you are trying to corrupt my first-born child, I will bring you down baby! I will bring you down to Chinatown!\"Mrs Byrnes is good too (Blythe Danner), who\\'s brilliantly quirky and all the more likable for it. She\\'s the only member of the family that likes Greg, while the others unfairly crucify him every chance they get. Although at times, it\\'s understandable why they do.Owen Wilson puts in an excellent performance as Pam\\'s oh-so-perfect ex-boyfriend Kevin. He stands out very well among the whole family, while some of the others fade into the background. That may be the only complaint I have. With so many family members present they\\'re not given enough to do.Without giving too much away, the film has an ending that is very satisfying. Greg going insane at an air-hostess is one of the funniest things I\\'ve ever seen in a film, as is Greg getting a few things off his chest about being Jack\\'s son-in-law.Overall, the jokes range from small to enormous. Some are packed away into the background for you to find. Like a rare flower Greg buys to impress Jack. To the casual observer its a flower pot filled with soil. Because the flower hasn\\'t bloomed yet. In a later scene, the pot is put with the other flowers, where it looks really out of place. Its jokes like these that impress the most for the way the filmmakers don\\'t draw attention to them. Subtle puns that only further illustrate how far apart Greg stands from the Byrnes clan. Which is why you feel such sympathy for Greg while you\\'re laughing at his misfortunes. A rare thing.A magnificent film, and the best comedy I\\'ve seen since Groundhog Day. Because of it\\'s simple theme and a stellar cast, Meet the Parents becomes something quite special. It avoids all of the obvious pitfalls, it never becomes tedious, and there\\'s quite a bit of subtlety to the slapstick as the embarrassing humiliations escalate steadily.I can\\'t wait for the sequel!\"', '\"Ben Stiller has established himself as a super star. He is so good and so funny and is quickly becoming the \"sane\" more likeable version of Jim Carrey (whom I despise). His comedic talent is fantastic. DeNiro is always super and I believe he has launched a new career in his comedic roles. His facial expressions are wonderful, his timing and everything about him is great. We saw a preview of the movie last night and it was sold out and the house roared all the way through the entire movie. It is a must see movie. One of the funniest of the year. Ben continues his great work after keeping the faith and Mary..I can\\'t wait for Meet the Parents II or for those in the know, meet the Maath-a-toon-em!\"', '\"I enjoyed \"Miss Congeniality.\"  Most of the casting I was happy about. Candice Bergen, William Shatner & Michael Caine had outstanding performances in their supporting roles.  Even Sandra Bullock did a good job even though she is too old to do pageants.  Benjamin Bratt looked & seemed lost in the movie.   If he had a little more of his TV character, he would have done a better job pulling it off.  Blame it on the script. The average Bullock fan should enjoy this movie.  It\\'s worth renting.\"', '\"And I desperately hope it will stay that way. Apart from a maximum of about three or four funny ideas this cineastic disaster has accomplished nothing. The story is weak, the actors are weak, or making an effort on acting weak. And I do not wish to give a comment on the dialogues, for I am sure in return I would be excluded from this site. I respect everybody who can cope with that type of humour, I failed.\"', '\"I\\'ve got to admit, I laughed hard at a few of the sight gags. However, these were few and far between. Most of the movie is below locker-room level humor, with an emphasis on shock sexual jokes that left us shaking our heads. Like the movies it attempted to parody, it is uneven and senseless.By comparison, the Airplane movies weren\\'t paragons of plot, but they were creative and fast-paced enough to keep me grinning. This was just too predictable. But hey! It was better than Blair Witch! ;-)\"', '\"Sandra Bullock is one of the top Comedy Actresses \\nyet she has shown power as a dramatic star (BLIND SIDE)\\nShe knows comedy, has great timing, and though sometimes her characters are a bit extreme or daffy, she comes off as very smart.

So much fun, I have no idea why this has a low rating...we don\\'t have very many good comedies to watch.Sammy\"', '\"I will admit it up front, I really dislike Martin Lawerence, I think despite his comedic appeal, his act is normally hateful. But a couple friends told me that they kinda enjoyed Big Mama\\'s House, so I figured that I should give it a chance. I sometimes like these kind of movies, I especially enjoyed White Chicks, and Big Mama\\'s House seemed simular, so in some ways I guess that I was kinda excited, maybe it was stupid humor that only a few would get or not want to admit that they liked, but I was wrong.Malcom is a FBI agent who is investigating a deadly convict on the run, this convict might be paying a visit to an old girlfriend and their son. The girlfriend decides to go visit Big Mama, her grandmother, but when Big Mama leaves town unexpectidly, Malcom disguises himself as Big Mama and convinces the girl and the whole town that he is her. But he is falling for the girl in the mean time and has to keep his act up as her loving grandmother without going too far.Sometimes stupid, stereotypical, and offensive, I can understand why this movie isn\\'t well received by most. It isn\\'t well acted and it is completely predictable, this is better than most Martin Lawerence films I\\'ve seen, but that\\'s not saying much.

Long list of cameos are real fun, but it\\'s Stiller and Wilson together on screen that takes the cake.

In the first Friday, Craig himself is funnier, as are all the bit players.  Here, no one really has anything interesting to say or do at all.Clifton Powell\\'s turn as Pinky is by far the funniest thing in this movie. Otherwise, there isn\\'t much going on.

They used all the best gags in the ads (which isn\\'t saying much) and the presence of De Niro dominated. Maybe it\\'s just me, for I know this was a big hit, but I couldn\\'t stand seeing a highly regarded actor like Robert De Niro mugging his way through this lowbrow flick like it were a 108-minute Saturday Night Live sketch--which is what it should have been. It is staggeringly annoying watching Ben Stiller endure thinly veiled threat after threat, and it\\'s not even rewarding when he finally stands up for himself.Judging by this films box-office take, I guess I\\'m not in the majority when I say I am sick of the whole \"you\\'re not good enough for my daughter\" schtick in movies and TV (the dreck known as \"8 Simple Rules\" is another example). However, I would like to thank IMDb for this website which allows me to vent my extreme displeasure at this totally unoriginal and irritating trend. I found this \"comedy\" utterly awful.P.S. If you agree with me, you might want to check out the Roach\\'s previous film, Mystery Alaska. I wish it had been a hit, and Roach were making more subtle comedies like it today rather than succumbing to using easy gags and pandering to mainstream taste.\"', '\"\"Did I Know What You Did Last Summer make any sense?\". This is the question that is posed during one of the many funny scenes of Scary Movie. While I did enjoy those movies, I do acknowledge some of their flaws, therefore it was a pleasure to poke fun at those and many other horror classics. Scary Movie (Scream\\'s original title) is a 90 minute laugh out loud experience you need to witness. Sure it isn\\'t the smartest spoof comedy ever, but between the more pop culture oriented jokes, as well as the sexual references, you may find some gems in this Wayans Bros. script. As the movie that launched Anna Faris as a comedy heavyweight, one can definitely see her style present in this film. My favorite among the series, Scary Movie is ,in general, my favorite spoof movie, with Airplane coming in as the best of the genre as a whole. As far as this one goes, it is in my eyes a comedy classic since its serves its purpose of making your insides burst out with genuine laughter.

About the only \"positive\"thing about the movie was the fact that they intertwined inside jokes for movie buffs such as the 2001 reference and such. Also the appearance of DavidBowie was cool, but this is by far the dumbest movie I have ever seen. It was full of offensive humor. The story line was dumb. The fact that his friends get killed in a gasoline explosion--and the whole fashion thing. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. At least Legally Blonde went somewhere with the fashion thing. Don\\'twaste your time.\"', '\"The Whole Nine Yards gives you all sides to the story. Oz (good name) getting mixed up with his gangster neighbor Jimmy \"The Tulip\" Tudeski (what a great name) while rival gangster Janni Gogolak (what a great name) is wanting Jimmy and Oz dead but meanwhile Oz is falling for Jimmy\\'s ex-wife Cynthia (really good name) whilst Oz\\' current wife Sophie (name) is trying to get Special Agent Steve Hanson (fairly horrible name) to whack Oz all while Jill St. Claire (ok name), Jimmy\\'s biggest fan, and Franklin \"Frankie Figs\" Figueroa (niiiice name) try to team up with Jimmy and Oz to kill Janni and all his men. Bruce Willis is so funny, not in this movie, but just in general. Matthew Perry holds his own and is in no way disappointing. Kevin Pollack is comical and dialed in. Natasha Henstridge is worth all the risk. I cannot get enough of Roseanna Arquette\\'s character. Amanda Peet hands down gives the best performance, she really has nice tits. Michael Clarke Duncan provides a strong supporting presence. Harland Williams is well-cast and adds his bit of funny to the movie. The Whole Nine Yards is silly and entertaining the whole way through. The part at the very end on the boat where Jimmy tosses Oz the canned beer but it just flies right past his head, that\\'s a classic funny moment!\"', '\"This movie isn\\'t exactly an example of great taste but still you can\\'t help laughing at it.It\\'s one of those movies that is humor filled, with means that you are being bombarded constantly with jokes, of which some are just too lame for words, while others will make you laugh surely. Really a movie with hits and misses but luckily in this case the movie its hits make it worthwhile.Because it spoofs so many movie, the movie isn\\'t really being a one-joke movie. Its plot line provides the movie with plenty of opportunities to let spoof-sequences fill up the movie. It lets the story flow rather well and keeps the pace high but pleasant. Even though it\\'s all quite silly and very childish, it\\'s a movie that entertains and that was of course also exactly what this movie got made for. It\\'s a spoof in the same trend as the Naked Gun movies for instance, which on its own also aren\\'t exactly great movies but hilarious and entertaining ones nevertheless.You can say that this movie got made at the right time. Horror movies were starting to regain their popularity again at the time and the Scary Movie-series perfectly exploits this. It makes these movie very profitable ones and it also adds to the popularity of both the modern horror and comedy genre. I sort of feel that the Scary Movie movies are also somewhat responsible for the many horror remakes of classic movies. These movies showed, by spoofing them, how popular and still well known these classic movies were by the young movie goers and therefore also profitable and interesting to do for the big studios.This movie is simply good and fun for what it is!6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\"', '\"First off, I liked Zoolander. I laughed a lot, I loved the cameos, I couldn\\'t get enough of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, but I wished I could have given this movie a higher score than 7. I can\\'t. For some odd reason, I just wasn\\'t sold. Ben Stiller\\'s portrayal of Derek Zoolander came across very clunky at times, and the movie seemed to lack a whole flow, as if I was just waiting for the next laugh or cameo. I know it\\'s just a comedy, but Stiller led a little movie called \" There\\'s Something About Mary\" where I actually did care, and I just didn\\'t here.\"', '\"Zoolander pulled off what many see as an \"easily written movie, just act dumb!\" Acting dumb and writing dumb takes a huge amount of talent though, and Zoolander placed a huge 10 on my scale!

There were two or three flat spots, but they were more than made up for by the rest of it. You\\'ll need to have seen at least \"Scream\" and \"Scream 2\" to get about 95% of it, and there are also references to \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", \"I Still Know....\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", \"The Matrix\", \"The Blair Witch Project\", \"Sixth Sense\", and \"The Usual Suspects\". One reference I particularly liked, which might be a bit obscure especially to those not old enough to remember the shows: David Lander appears as Principal Squiggy. In the 70\\'s, Lander starred as Squiggy in \"Laverne and Shirley\", which was a spin-off of \"Happy Days\", which starred Henry Winkler, who played Principal Himbry in \"Scream\".\"', '\"I like most of Ben Stiller\\'s movies, but this one, in my opinion, was very lame.I kept waiting for the \"funny scenes\" of the film to appear...they did not!

I have always liked Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry, and I also quite like Michael Duncan and Amanda Peet. And of course, I love a good comedy. So I was pretty excited to see THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. It did not live up to my expectationsÂ…it soared past them.A resident of Canada, Oz Osercansky (Matthew Perry) is a dentist who is living with a wife (Rosanna Arquette) who he hates and she hates him, but they don\\'t get a divorce for money reasons. When a hit man named Jimmy \"the Tulip\" Tudeski (Bruce Willis) moves in next door, Oz finds out his wife is trying to find hit men that will kill him. Jimmy, who takes a liking to Oz, doesn\\'t agree to kill Oz, but seeks Oz\\'s help in getting Jimmy\\'s wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and his enemy, Yanni (Kevin Pollak), together so he can kill them. Oz, along with another hit man named Frankie Figs (Michael Duncan) finds himself unwittingly helping, but he starts to fall in love with Cynthia and won\\'t let her die.My plot description sounds quite bad, but the movie is very good and funny. The collection of actors in this movie are superb. Bruce Willis is good as the loveable murderer. Matthew Perry does a great comedic job as usual. Michael Duncan fit the part of the really big and scary hit man pretty well too. The adorable Amanda Peet was really good too as the hit-woman wannabe.I saw ANALYZE THIS a few days before I saw this, and I thought this one blew it away. The actors are better, the characters are cooler, the jokes are funnier (I was laughing out loud on many occasions) and the mixture of crime and comedy is pulled off a lot better in this movie, which is strange because there is more crime in this one than in ANALYZE THIS. Both the comedy and the crime are pulled off terrifically. Go see this movie now, you\\'ll love it.\"', '\"Seeing this film was a a pleasant surprise. I don\\'t remember laughing so hard since *There\\'s Something About Mary*. Not that I\\'m usually fond of outrageous comedies, but sometimes I am.The only cast member I knew when I got in the cinema was DeNiro. I didn\\'t know about Teri Polo or Ben Stiller, and sure this was a good way to get to know them. I think she is very cute and not yet the spaghetti-like figure Hollywood seems to be obsessed with. I enjoyed Robert DeNiro\\'s comic side, something he hasn\\'t showed too often, unfortunately, being Midnight Run the only exception as far as I know.Some detractors of Meet The Parents have come down really hard on it, saying the comic situations are too exaggerated, but that\\'s what makes the movie so hilarious ok? I will not spoil it because wouldn\\'t be fair to those who haven\\'t seen the movie.It may be not perfect, but who cares? To me, it turned out to be better and funnier than expected. 9/10.\"', '\"\"Zoolander\" is probably Ben Stiller\\'s silliest endeavor. I found it quite amusing, but its silliness did get to me at times. It\\'s an enjoyable movie in a juvenile, sophomoric kind of way. You obviously can\\'t take Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), or any of his male model friends, seriously. And you especially can\\'t take Hansel (Owen Wilson) seriously when you\\'re staring at that huge sniffer on his face.It is a fun movie with a fair amount of laughable parts. Will Farrell does an excellent job as Mugato and David Duchovny\\'s cameo is very amusing. Don\\'t expect much from this movie in terms of plot or logic and you can have yourself a good time.\"', '\"Meet The Parents is far better in terms of genuine comedy than most of the cr*p we get in cinemas nowadays. It has its cringe-worthy moments, it has its hilarious happenings and it has its occasional disgusting humour (especially when Focker flushes the toilet and covers the back garden in poo), but it actually manages to fit in a real plot and real character, rather than just feeling like some sort of overlong sketch show. A lot of the humour relies heavily on Focker getting himself into very sticky situations - and some of the more serious things will have you cringing to death. As the movie continues, luck gets worse for Focker and the cringe factor gets higher, until the end in which everything is resolved. From cats to shrines, Focker finds himself having trouble with everything he encounters. The ending sets the scene for the sequel - which was just as good, if not better. Sometimes the emotions become painful in the film - especially at the dinner table when Jack reads the poem in memory of his mother - which only helps to make Focker get into even more trouble. There\\'s nothing better than building up the tension... 9/10\"', '\"After watching Miss C. I thought Sandy B. was great.  She was funny and physically challenged in playing Gracie Hart.  I also thought Heather Burns was funny also; her simplicity and childish attitude was great backing to Bullock.  Everyone run out and see this movie.\"', '\"The only laugh I had in renting this movie was in reading on the box that someone considered it \"razor-sharp\" satire and an \"outrageously funny parody\".The box was hilarious!\"', '\"Bridget Jones (RenÃ©e Zellweger) is 32, over-weight, drinks too much, smokes too much, and perpetually single. At the New Year party, her mother tries to set her up with family friends\\' son divorced lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) who isn\\'t happy with the setup. She starts a diary vowing to fix her life. She has a crush on her boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) at the London publisher. She begins a relationship with him despite his womanizing past. It goes bad and she quits. She gets a spot as a TV reporter which results in some usual reporting. Darcy gets claimed by lawyer colleague Natasha (Embeth Davidtz). Darcy and Cleaver were once best friends but an affair with Darcy\\'s wife have made them enemies. She bounces back and forth between Darcy and Cleaver. All the while, Bridget\\'s parents\\' marriage is in trouble.RenÃ©e Zellweger is adorably awkward. She does some tough work transforming herself into a chubby Brit. I\\'m sure a real Brit would probably work better but Zellweger does a good job. Also there is a question of exactly how chubby she really is. The movie tries to accentuate her weight but she\\'s never not adorable. The story is fun and sitcomy. It has its own heart especially with her father played by Jim Broadbent. It has two dashing male leads and all the angsty love triangle fun in the world.\"', '\"All male supermodel Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) wants at the moment is to discover whether there\\'s more to life than \"being really really really ridiculously good-looking.\" But badguy fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell, in an inspired, hilarious charicature) has other ideas: he\\'s looking for the dumbest guy in the fashion industry to assassinate the president of Malaysia.It strings its gags together with the form of an espionage thriller: the plot of which has badguy Mugatu looking for a really Laugh-out-loud comedy performances, fun satire of modelling industry and terrific chemistry between duo Stiller and Owen Wilson.It has enough terrific lines and moments that a group of friends will see it together and feel like repeating the lines to each other for weeks on end. I\\'ve seen it happen - with more than one group of people.10/10.\"', '\"The 10/10 rating of course only applies to people who would desire to watch such a movie (for anyone else, it\\'s a zero). A spoof of \"Scream\", \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", and other such movies, \"Scary Movie\" is another in the gag-a-minute genre associated with the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, the \"Airplane!\" crowd, and so on. Some scenes were kinda gross (they can\\'t go without scatological humor, can they?), but overall harmless. The end was a real surprise. I never saw \"Scary Movie 2\" (I assumed that it was the same), but I did see \"Scary Movie 3\"...and it was pretty much the same. And there\\'s a \"Scary Movie 4\" coming out soon (we can probably assume that it\\'s the same).\"', '\"Surely, there is a Bridget Jones in all of us! At least I can certainly recognize myself in a lot of the things she says, thinks and does. This movie manages to be heart warming without getting too sugary and still it doesn\\'t lack guts! We have love, hate, disappointment, excitement and a fist-fight. There are some scenes that are absolutely hilarious (like Zellwegers tv-debut in a fire station and the \"Tarts & vicars party\") and others that are touching or heartbreaking (look at Zellweger\\'s face when she finds another woman in Hugh Grant\\'s bathroom). Every member in the cast is perfect. Grant plays a manipulative yet very charming creep, and does it well. It\\'s a long way from \"Four weddings...\" where he was the one who had a sort of Bridget Jones-character to play. You DO however understand why Bridget is attracted to him. Colin Firth is the straight-laced lawyer who develops a crush for Bridget early on (if not at first), but have great difficulties to express his feelings. A character like his isn\\'t easy to put across and might become a bore in the wrong hands. It is a great strength of Mr Firth that he conveys a sort of boyish awkwardness and lack of confidence instead of inducing yawns. Smaller parts are equally well cast with a few stand-outs, like Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent as her parents and James Callis as her gay friend. But finally there is Zellweger and she is perfect in her part! Absolutely amazing performance. You root for her all the way because you always feel she is so HUMAN. She makes foolish mistakes and put her foot in her mouth on quite a few occasions, but who hasn\\'t? She is sweet, funny and a fighter. And she is in every single scene in the movie(except for a few funny ones during the end-credits) and yet I didn\\'t spot a single false note in her performance. Academy-award stuff, really! If the movie has one small fault it is that a few scenes tend to drag a bit and are not as funny as they could have been. I also think that too many of the minor characters were reduced to clichÃ©s, but i have to admit that I probably wouldn\\'t have laughed as much if it had been otherwise. All in all, a treat!\"', '\"It seems that all of America has gone to see `Meet The Parents.\\' I do have to admit that it did take me awhile to `Meet The Parents.\\' Which explains why I always tend to break the romantic law once I meet some potential in-laws. But that is another story. I just recently saw `Meet The Parents\\' and did think it was a funny film, but not as funny as I though it was going to be. That was probably because of the hoopla. I guess I should have familiarized myself with `Meet The Parents\\' when it first came out in the theatre. But that is what happens for being a lazy `focker.\\' Oh `god!\\' I just thought Robert Deniro was so funny as the overprotective `father\\', and there is something about Ben Stiller that is making him the acting king of the bad luck characters in cinema today. By the way- even though most of you know, this film is about the hilarious bad luck situations that happen to Stiller\\'s character when he stays in at his girlfriend\\'s parents house for the first time. So go and `Meet Those Parents.\\' You will be a true `focker\\' if you miss this funny flick. **** Good\"', '\"This week I watched Meet The Parents (2000). The logline reads \"Male nurse Greg Focker meets his girlfriend\\'s parents before proposing, but her suspicious father is every date\\'s worst nightmare.\" The main characters are Greg, our antagonist, his girlfriend Pam and her father Jack. Greg\\'s main goal in this film is to win the approval of his girlfriend\\'s father and then ask his her to marry him. What stands in Greg\\'s way is Jack\\'s automatic disapproval of him and a continuous strand of bad luck that hijacks his every move. Although Greg tries his best to keep a level head this back luck is only further instigated by Jack\\'s disapproval. Although the movie is a comedy and I thought it fit into its genre quite well - it is not a movie that I found particularly \"moving\" mostly because I don\\'t enjoy this style of movie. However, I did enjoy watching it and will likely continue to watch it\\'s sequels.\"', '\"This is a MUST, MUST, MUST see film. There are too many funny moments to pick one out, although the knicker scene is destined to become a classic. The whole cinema was laughing at the misadventures of this 32 year old single female trying to have a life despite everyone else. In the end she finds happiness with the right man, of course. The journey there is in parts touching but the story is always told with humour. Anyone who said that a Texan could not play a sometimes dowdy Englishwoman had not allowed for the tour-de-force performance by Zellweger, any doubts about her acting ability, in some quarters are definitely laid to rest here. The supporting English cast were excellant as were Grant and Firth, (the fight scene!?)This is going to be one of the high spots of my cinema going year.\"', '\"Zoolander is a satire film, but unlike other films, this one touches a new territory, male modelling. This was an interesting experience for me because I have no real interest in male modelling and know very little about the subject.Despite this, I enjoyed it. The plot goes somewhat like this. Derek Zoolander, famous male model, is humiliated when his enemy, Hansel, wins the award he was aiming for. When his friends try to cheer him up, they all die in an explosion. Meenwhile, evil fashion designer Mugatu, is plotting to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia for his new policy against sweatshops, and he needs, Derek Zoolaner, the single stupidest male model in existence, to do it for him.Zoolander, Hansel and Mugatu are two of the funniest characters I have ever seen. The other characters though, are a little bland. I don\\'t hate them, I just think they\\'re a little bit boring.All in all, a good movie with a funny main lead, original premise, but some slightly boring support characters.\"', '\"For some reason, the makers of this movie (the Wayans brothers-who also star) decided to pretty much, in my view, make a scene by scene remake of the vastly superior horror/comedy \"Scream\".\"Scream\" was a witty hatchet job on all the conventions of the horror movie which we now take for granted-take for granted because of movies like \"Scream\".Now, presumably, the Wayans brothers missed all the wit of \"Scream\" and thought it would be funnier with low-brow humour. It definitely isn\\'t.From memory (it\\'s been a few years since I saw it on network TV) it also \\'parodies\\' other movies of around the time, like \"I know what you did last summer\". Can\\'t really remember too much about it...it\\'s more a narrative movie than the latter sketch comedy movies in this franchise. In any case, if you\\'ve seen \"Scream\", you\\'ll know how this movie plays out, but it will just have a more lowest common denominator sense of humour to it.Even though I did find this movie a dud (glad I didn\\'t pay to see it!), I do recommend the sequel-the second one I think, which parodies such movies as The Exorcist. That one, especially, really marked the high water mark for these comedy makers.Not sure how many of this franchise I\\'ve seen afterwards...I do know that I saw the last cinema release (Scary Movie 4) and was again disappointed by the Wayans\\' efforts. Some of the latter movies had the involvement of the guys behind the brilliant comedy \"Flying High\" (a.k.a. \"Airplane!\") (Zucker and Abrahams), which I\\'ve reviewed here. They couldn\\'t quite recapture the magic of their past efforts though.Overall-Scary Movie is a film to avoid. The second movie is well worth watching though-it helps if you\\'ve seen films like \"House on Haunted Hill\" for that though, to get some of the parody.\"', '\"_Scary Movie_ is a parody of many contemporary horror films (most notably, _Scream_ and its sequels). And to give it some credit, it does have its moments; it did make me laugh (out loud) on a number of scenes. But, as the film rolled on, I thought that it relied on too many \"gross out\" jokes to generate its laughs. Personally, I didn\\'t find some of its grosser scenes--scenes which might make the Farrelly brothers blush with embarrassment--to be funny at all. I just found them to be gross and disgusting. Also, the film contains a lot of attempted jokes that just fall flat. If one laughs at them, it might be more out of courtesy than out of perceived hilarity of the situation. Overall, the movie is okay; it\\'s worth seeing--but it is nothing to scream about\"', '\"\"Next Friday\" has the same slacker attitude as the first movie \"Friday\" with a little more plot line. The big disappointment is the lack of Chris Tucker as he was a big drawcard for the first movie. Once again this movie is completely watchable although it does edge into sequel territory where the storyline feels more worked and less organic in it\\'s development. Also the characters weren\\'t as good and felt typical to this style of movie.Not a bad effort as a sequel but it misses the mark. It\\'s lucky it is connected to a cult hit or it would not have been as successful (and I use that term lightly).\"', '\"I\\'m so disappointed in Ben Stiller.  I think he\\'s a very talentedwriter, director and actor but he blew it on this movie.  Zoolandermight have been a funny character for a MTV short, but is horriblyboring to watch for over an hour.  The plot is predictable andstupid.  It\\'s just no fun to watch someone act like such an idiot.  Noone is that stupid.  The trailer made the film seem reallyunappealing.  The trailer was right.\"', '\"One of the best in the genre. I like to watch it occasionally when i want to have a good laugh.\"', '\"I became a fan of Ben Stiller only recently, after watching him as a guest in the program called `Inside The Actor\\'s Studio\\' produced by James Lipton. He was so likeable and naturallyÂ… funny. When asked if being funny was a skill or a gift, he replied that he didn\\'t know how you could teach somebody to be funny. Before that, I had seen him in: There\\'s Something About Mary and Meet The Parents. At that time, I was more interested in watching Cameron Diaz or Robert De Niro\\'s performances.In his previous movies, Ben Stiller would portray a nice but unlucky guy, so incredibly unlucky that it was unnerving. With Zoolander, he remains a nice guy, but instead of being incredibly unlucky, he becomes a victim. He is no longer the hero - lacking super human powers though - who has to face adverse circumstances to achieve his goal (conquer the woman that he loves, or her family for that matter). In Zoolander, he is a kind of anti-hero who had no goal whatsoever (apart from having absolute FUN Â– even at the cost of human lives), until his fame shakes and he becomes a target of a dreadful manipulation...I\\'d say, if you are NOT a fan of Ben Stiller; or if you are a fan of the Ben Stiller of his previous movies; or if you expect the comedy genre to be witty and high-brow, stay home and wait until it\\'s available on video to rent Zoolander. You\\'ll have a good time if you keep your mind open and want to relax one evening.Derek Zoolander has only the look for him, and a big heart Â– but other than that, he is VERY stupid. In fact, he is a caricature, meaning that his character is based on real life traits. But those real traits are found in various persons. For the purpose of the caricature, they are mixed together in one character and distorted with great exaggeration. As a result, people are fooled: they think that someone like Derek Zoolander cannot be found out there in the real world, nor either of the other characters in the movie.I especially liked the opening scene in the warehouse, where they plan to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister and state the reasons why he is a threat to the industry. I also liked the shots for Derek Zoolander\\'s first appearance, through the journalist Matilda Jeffries. There is a suspense that was nicely built up: what is he going to look like?! Another of my favorite scenes was the brainwashing scene, where he is made to believe that the children themselves claim for their rights to be able to work in the factories. And I found the new historical perspective on Lincoln and Kennedy assassinations very funny.Because the whole thing is a true FARCE Â– nobody feels threatened, very rare are the people who will gain a new insight, a fresh outlook on what our everyday world is made of, how we contribute to model it by the choices or non-choices that we make. So all is well, we are safe and we still have fun!I found the theme of the movie very enticing: the modeling/fashion industry, and featuring a male model in a ridiculous manner is a great idea. The directing by Ben Stiller was good. There was a good pace and the movie moved along smoothly. The only thing I missed was more `insights\\' on the modeling industry, such as the flashback Derek Zoolander had on pretending to be a monkey during a photo shoot. The David Bowie cameo appearance was very nicely done.Some people didn\\'t like the fact that Zoolander appeared as a kind of `family movie\\', with Ben Stiller\\'s Dad (Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein) and his wife (Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries) play supporting roles. Jerry Stiller was perfect for the role and great in this movie. Christine Taylor was OK, but to me, she failed to inspire a special feeling for this female journalist (good girl/bad girl?). Maybe the script was at fault, but as a talented actress, she should have been able to carve an unforgettable character for Matilda Jeffries. Think about Milla Jovovich\\'s performance as Katinka. She was absolutely fantastic. We need more striking performances for female leads Â– which are unfortunately still too rare on the screen.I gave it 7 out of 10.\"', '\"God help me, I love movies about dumb guys, and this one is definitely a dumb-guy classic. And believe it or not, it\\'s all rather good-natured humor. I\\'d say it\\'s the best Ben Stiller movie I\\'ve seen so far, just edging out \"Meet the Parents\" and not a gross-out flick like \"Something About Mary.\" OK, it\\'s totally silly and frivolous, but it\\'s silliness and frivolity at it\\'s best. The best scenes are the brainwashing segment and the \"walkoff\" between Zoolander and Hansel with David Bowie as referee. And it\\'s great to see Ben and his dad working together.\"', '\"Well, first I\\'d like to say that I\\'m a big fan of the Wayans brothers, I watched \"Don\\'t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood \" (a 1996 movie that Marlon & Shawn wrote) and I immediately fell for them! I than noticed the huge talent those two had and that\\'s why I was pretty excited when I\\'ve heard that they wrote yet another Comedy-Parody movie. I went to the theater with lots of excitement and anticipation. And believe me, I wasn\\'t disappointed when I left the theater! \"Scary Movie\" is a real pleasant break out of life, I almost wet my pants... I never stopped laughing! The wayans brothers simply took every single ridicules thing out of the new yet old genre movies called \"teen-slaughter\" and found a refreshing way to totally mock them. I really enjoyed watching them for 88 minutes making fun of every single movie that was made in the last 5 years with a minimum funding and a bad line of actors that can\\'t even persuade an Eskimo to buy a heater (Maybe beside David & Courtney Cox Arquette) and made millions at the box office (It\\'s just not fare to art!). I also wanted to say that I\\'m really impressed by the way Lochlyn Munro manages to maintain a magnificent performance every single time (considering his small but wide roles). such as:\"A night at the Roxbury\" & \"Dead man on campus\". And also, the Amazing Anna Faris that did a great job on this breakthrough movie for her. In conclusion, I give this Movie a 10 out of 10 in the TRON\\'s scale of movies. And I would like to add that I saw this movie 4 times in the theater, that\\'s how good I thought it was!\"', '\"The reason why I was not disappointed about this movie is that I didn\\'t have many expectations. Yes, it\\'s funny in a couple of scenes, but nothing better than your average sex/sentimentality \"chick\" flick. I didn\\'t read the book and I still don\\'t think it\\'s one of my priorities but as the story was presented, I wonder who wasn\\'t already prepared to see Bridget disappointed with one guy and switch to the other, only apparently less likeable one. Good acting performances make me slightly raise the rating, but just like many other movies, \"Bridget Jones\\'s Diary\" is definitely not worth the hype.6/10\"', '\"Having seen the trailer and thought \\'doesn\\'t look very good\\', I decided to see it anyway since I have a membership that enables me to see as many films as I want.The film totally surpassed my expectations. Having recently decided that Jeepers Creepers and The Animal were two of the worst films I\\'ve ever seen I was completely unprepared for  what I was about to see. This is now only second to Showgirls for The Worst Movie Ever Made.How is it possible for the man who was hilarious in a five minute appearance in Friends and equally brilliant in There\\'s Something About Mary, Mystery Men and Meet The Parents take a giant step backwards create such a disastrously bad film? It failed to even raise a faint smile on my face for the entire 90 minutes.What I can\\'t believe are the ones who have given it good ratings. Are they mad? They\\'re probably the same people who think Showgirls is a brilliant American satire. I was surrounding by people laughing out loud and (this is no lie) applauding some of the jokes. I\\'m disappointed that it\\'s not possible to give a lower rating than 1.Easily the worst film I\\'ve seen in a cinema (I saw Showgirls on TV). Even though I didn\\'t pay to see it, I still demanded my money back at the end. Don\\'t watch it. Ever. You\\'ll thank me in the end.By the way, I thought The Cable Guy was very funny.I still can\\'t believe they were applauding...\"', '\"If you were to come up with a story of an ex-gangster trying to lay low and his nervous, spineless neighbor, you\\'d cast Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry, at the height of his FRIENDS fame, right? The Whole Nine Yards, a classic comedy at the cusp of the 1990s, perfectly reflects the times. It\\'s quick, intelligent, and rather tame, summing up the \\'90s; yet it turns the corner and gets slightly darker, weirder, and has a little more sex and nudity, representing the decade about to start.As perfect as the leads are in their roles, the supporting cast is even more memorable. Amanda Peet is bold and daring, sprinkling Tabasco sauce on her meal like it\\'s a watering can. Rosanna Arquette and Kevin Pollak both sport hilarious accents, and Michael Clarke Duncan, as the latter\\'s henchman, wears a great stone face so you can\\'t tell who\\'s side he\\'s on. Natasha Henstridge plays Bruce\\'s wife, and in her beautiful clothes, she\\'s polished and classy to balance out the rest of the movie. Check out this funny, off-beat comedy to pretend you\\'re still in the \\'90s!\"', '\"Bridget Jones is a real person.  She\\'s someone any of us knows, as are her two would-be suitors, her gadfly friends, her stroppy parents and the melange of people who populate her life in this year.  How they got a woman from Texas to sound so believably British is a minor miracle, and it\\'s one of the many ways Renee Zellweger shines in this role. British women need not despair that an American got this role, because she does them all proud. Though I\\'ve not read all of Helen Fielding\\'s book, the film captures the essence of a thirtysomething woman struggling for self-definition in a world of pigeon holes.What was even more refreshing was to see Hugh Grant playing a downright scoundrel, departing from the shy, erstwhile characters he usually plays. He, too, deserves kudos for a totally believable.  So does Colin Firth as the stodgy Mark Darcy.  Though a couple of characters in the book were a bit forgotten, the balance of the film is charming, endearing and down-to-earth. It\\'s a film one can enjoy \"just the way it is.\"\"', '\"The movie had great potential as a spoof of the modeling industry, but the makers threw much of that away by turning it into a rather absurd, and fairly predictable conspiracy movie.It still ended up being somewhat entertaining and many of the characters were great, particularly the two main models. The whole discussion between Zoolander and his friends about how meaningful it is to be a model is alone wonderful and hilarious.However, the decision to focus the plot on foiling an evil conspiracy, while providing some entertaining elements itself, overall adding nothing and instead distracted from the promising model-spoof theme. Almost all the humor in this film came from the portrayal of the modeling industry and they could have done so much more that was fresh and funny with that had they stuck with it. The conspiracy theme, on the other hand, took the film onto well-worn path that proved to be bland, tired, and predictable.\"', '\"Frankly, I did not find the film to be very funny or entertaining. It seems that the measure of a film now-a-days is not how much it entertains, but how well it does at the box office. Some pretty lousy films have done well with ticket sales, while some other films have had something to say, but have fallen short of the dollar mark. This was an OK film, but not one that I would call a \"must see\" movie. And then, for it to spawn a sequel is beyond all belief. I tried to give the movie a fair watching--after all, I assumed that with De Niro on the screen there would be much there to watch--but I kept finding myself mouthing off the words of the kids in the back seat of the van ...\" are we there yet??\" De Niro has a broad spectrum, a big range for his acting talents. But he is an extraordinary actor who, it seems, falls flat on his face when he is not cast as an extraordinary character. It was awfully big of him to take the role of the father, but it felt more like casting Humphrey Bogart as an extra. And as for Ben Stiller...he still has a ways to go to establish a screen persona. His character was somewhat nebulous...though he did well at defining how vulnerable the character was. Comparing Stiller to De Niro, or even to his father, Jerry, is something of an unfair comparison, but he has yet to come up with that defining character or characteristic. The situations are stretched somewhat out of proportion, and Jay Roach\\'s direction works far better with Mike Myers, where reckless abandon of plot and characters are the rule and not the exception. Based on what I saw in this film, I am in no hurry to see \"The Fockers\". I only recommend this film if you have nothing better to do.\"', '\"I absolutely LOVE this movie! There are some really funny parts in it. It\\'s a movie for people who just need a good laugh. My favorite part is about the cat! It\\'s hilarious! I just hope that will never happen to me. The whole trip was a complete disaster. I really hope you go and watch this movie!\"', '\"So I\\'m not 30 something, in fact I\\'m quite under that but Bridget Jones has me extremely worried about that 30 something when I hit it!!  I rolled off the chair at least 100 times during this british comedy! Not only did I see it once in theatres but I dragged along a group for it a second time!! And then one of my friends saw it five more times after that when she dragged along various friends and family members. While the humor may be sick at times and the \"f\" word a little over used (but well used at that!) I just can\\'t wait till it\\'s out on video. And the best part. It\\'s not a chick flick!!  I dragged along the boyfriend and a few male friends and they loved it too!! So there you go, hats off to you Miss Bridget Jones!\"', '\"Comedy starring Sandra Bullock as Gracie Hart, a tough girl cop who is obsessed with her job, doesn\\'t have time for relationships and despises anything girly. After bungling a police operation, Gracie is consigned to go undercover as Miss New Jersey in the Miss USA beauty contest, resulting in hilarious elocution and posture lessons from an etiquette coach, excellently played by Michael Caine. As she just about convincingly gets through the extensive eliminating rounds, the cynical Gracie gets to know some of the other girls and is gradually transformed in her outlook to femininity and love. Inevitably she spots the saboteur, saves the day and ends the film as a more understanding heroine.The plot idea is extremely thin and it\\'s only the charming performance of Bullock that gets the viewer through. She\\'s ably assisted by the wonderful Michael Caine who pops up in the great role of Victor Melling, the man that must transform Gracie into a beauty queen and William Shatner makes good work of his role as Stan Fields the master of ceremonies. It\\'s great to see these two old actors hamming their parts up for all they are worse. I\\'ll also mention the cute and appealing Heather Burns who as Miss Rhode Island personifies every clichÃ© of the pageant scene and yet still makes a lovely character. It\\'s not a classic comedy by any stretch of the imagination, but it\\'s still immensely delightful and immensely watchable.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.\"', '\"it does scare you out of the movie theatre. i was looking for some random jokes with a somewhat unifying story but what i found was some random cut scenes (some funny others utterly absurd) trying to range the most movies they could what was quite confusing and deadly to the movie\\'s interest. i did laugh though...\"', '\"On paper, Scary Movie must have sounded like a great idea: after all, this film spoofs a series of slasher flicks, mostly Scream, which was a clever satire on horror traditions. How hard can it be to take those traditions and make fun of them, yet in a more extreme way than Wes Craven\\'s opus did? Judging from the finished movie, it\\'s very hard.The Wayans brothers, who came up with the whole concept (one of them directs the film, two act), seem to think the only thing you have to do is insert as much (gratuitous) crude humor and tasteless situations as possible. Movie opening with a big-breasted woman (Carmen Electra) who gets killed while running around in her underwear? Check. Bunch of stupid teenagers who, when not thinking how to defeat the killer, only talk about sex and drugs? Check. Endless rude jokes involving the aforementioned topics, as well as some puerile gay stuff? Check.That said, not everything is that bad. All the scenes featuring the Scream killer are quite funny, mainly because he\\'s the only character the filmmakers can mock in new, unseen ways. Everyone else, however, is a boring stereotype, particularly Shorty (Marlon Wayans), an obnoxious stoner with almost no comedic charisma. Imagine my surprise when I found out Wayans could actually portray a drug addict convincingly in the harrowing Requiem for a Dream.Those who haven\\'t seen it yet might find Scary Movie amusing the first time, otherwise it\\'s just another throwaway comedy.5,5/10\"', '\"I really don\\'t understand the critics of this movie.  When I go to the movies I wish to be entertained.  When we went to this movie, the theater was full and everyone was having a good time.  You can\\'t ask for any more than that.\"', '\"More socially redeeming than any Scream movie, this is still a hard one to comment on.  Although I laughed all the way through it, the big question seemed to be why?  Some genius worked hard to blend comedy slights and sexual innuendo to get away with a PG-13.\"', '\"How do they get away with showing this kind of crap in public?  \"Scary Movie\" was much closer to pornography than comedy, and I did not even bother to stay to see the whole movie.Based on most of the other user comments, it\\'s the kind of stuff quite a few people like, but if you value keeping your mind pure of lust, never see this.  (On a side note, I wonder how many couples did something a little extra after the movie who wouldn\\'t have?)\"', '\"In comedic films, the plot is often a secondary consideration. Like an unplanned vacation, the destination is not what\\'s important--it\\'s the journey itself that matters. Meet the Parents is a predictable plot based on an overused clichÃ©, and I give it two thumbs up. What counts here is not the plot, it\\'s the humor and the performances that make it worth the ride.Jay Roach is the director who inflicted Austin Powers on humanity. Fortunately, he is able to dial it down a notch here and give us humor that is a little more subtle--not much, but every bit helps. Ben Stiller plays the unfortunately named Greg Focker, who is on his way to meet the parents of the woman he loves. His character here is almost a reprise of his character in There\\'s Something About Mary. Greg is desperate to make a good impression on his girlfriend\\'s parents and his general anxiety turns into full-blown terror when he meets Pam\\'s father, Jack Byrnes. Jack (played by Robert DeNiro) is a rather humorless man who deep down believes that no man could be good enough for his little girl.Greg has been led to believe that Jack is a retired florist, but he soon discovers that Jack has an entirely different, and much darker, past. DeNiro is perfectly cast as the foreboding father figure, and DeNiro plays the part superbly. Greg soon discovers that even the most benign chatter is a kind of test, and he feels--quite rightly--that he is failing miserably.Virtually every character in this story lies to another character at one time or another. Much of the humor revolves around little lies that necessitate either full confessions or even bigger lies. The characters choose bigger lies almost every time. (\"Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive\"). The biggest laughs come as we watch Greg trying to extricate himself from one of his self-spun webs or as we watch Jack setting another trap.The tone of the film reminded me of Father of the Bride. Like that film, the predictability of the plot doesn\\'t really matter. We know from the beginning how it will ultimately end. Films like this rise or fall on the strength of the writing and the power of the performances. While there are thoroughly adequate supporting performances here, the real dynamic comes in the chemistry between Stiller and DeNiro. This is not great art or profound social commentary. But the audience roared as they watched these characters play out situations that were close enough to real to make them feel the embarrassment and frustration of the central characters. If you don\\'t get a chance to see it at the theater, save it for a video rental. For extra fun, invite your future in-laws and see if they think it\\'s funny.\"', '\"To start with a summary, I hated it. To give a balance, I generally like parodies, going back to Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, up to Airplane, plus \\'college\\' comedies like Aminal House, so possibly I\\'ve been spoilt by the best, by I also know and understand offensive, toilet humour. This film mainly tries to parody \\'Scream\\' which was a parody in itself. How do you parody a parody? Other films included are generally the likes of \\'I know what you did last summer\\' and also \\'The Matrix\\', \\'The Usual Suspects and \\'The Sixth Sense\\'. However some, if not most of the parodies of those films fall extremely flat, or simply replay a certain type of scene without any real parody or joke.As said, Airplane is one of my favourite ever parodies, and it would be hard for any movie to match that, and many have tried and failed, but this movie seems like an attempt by a junior class of 12 year-olds. The \\'funny bits\\' are bashed together generally, almost as if the different writers did all of their stuff separately, and didn\\'t bother to a) make it gel and b) check if it was funny or not. The only way I can describe it is, a sub-sub-sub standard of other fairly okay parody movies. Zero out of ten from me.\"', '\"This movie is a pleasant improvement over Nurse Betty.  Renee does an outstanding job of managing an English accent though out the movie.  The is no lapse of accent and you would believe that she is a English young woman. The story is cute although the use of four letter words excessive.  This is not an academy award movie it is a pleasant hour and a half.\"', '\"This film was great for a laugh and provided a good escape from reality for awhile.  Sandra Bullock finally got another great role that she played to the T.  The romantic aspects were a little weak but all in all it\\'s a great date movie and a guaranteed renter for a rainy day laugh.\"', '\"The amount of people who really seem to despise this film surprises me. It is obviously not to everyone\\'s taste (what is?) but the love that went into it\\'s making seems palpable to me. Added to which it\\'s one of the funniest films I\\'ve ever seen, brilliantly acted and directed and has an individual feel all it\\'s own.\"', '\"... Mark Darcy , the name and the character are boldly stolen from Pride and Prejudice, and in fact, in an inside joke, Firth played Jane Austen\\'s Darcy in a famous BBC version of the bookÂ… an excerpt from a 2001 film review of Bridget Jones\\'s Diary. Like most others reviews, it didn\\'t look very far below the surface to see that screen writers\\' Richard Curtis and Andrew Davies borrowed far more from Austen than Mark Darcy; they stole the entire plot. Proceed if you dare:1. In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Bennet, the heroine\\'s father, kindly, satiric and unambitious; spends most of his time hiding in his study from his silly wife. Is it a coincidence that in Bridget Jones\\'s Diary, Mr. Jones, kindly, satiric and unambitious, spends most of his time hiding in front of the TV from his silly wife? OK, one coincidence does not plagiarism make.2. In Pride and Prejudice, Mrs. Bennet\\'s main concern in life is to find eligible bachelors for her gaggle of five daughters, doing so in such transparent schemes and so much mindless chatter as to constantly embarrass her husband and two oldest girls; in Bridget Jones\\'s Diary, Mrs. Jones main concern in life is to find eligible bachelors for her daughter, doing so in such transparent schemes and so much mindless chatter as to constantly embarrass her husband and Bridget. Another coincidence you say, your smile becoming less relaxed.3. In Pride and Prejudice, the two youngest girls are foolish and flirtatious, Mary is awkward and studious, Jane is kind spirited and Elizabeth has discernment and common sense. If you were lump all these personalities into a single character, it would look a lot like Bridget Jones\\'s odd amalgam of traits: foolish and discerning, flirtatious, yet awkward and kind. Beginning to see a pattern... anyone, anyone?4. In Pride and Prejudice, the main action revolves around a contest between Mr. Wickham, a handsome soldier/cad who woos his way into the youngest daughter\\'s heart and bed, and besmirches the character of his rival, Mr. Darcy; in Bridget Jones\\'s Diary, the main action revolves around a contest between Daniel Cleaver, a handsome publisher/cad who woos his way into Bridget\\'s heart and bed and besmirches the character of his rival, Mark Darcy. Anyone, anyone?5. In Pride and Prejudice, Mark Darcy defends his good name poorly because of his reserve, fastidiousness, and taciturn nature; in Bridget Jones\\'s Diary, Mark Darcy defends his good name poorly because of his reserve, fastidiousness, and taciturn nature. Blinders, remove... anyone, anyone?6. In Pride and Prejudice, Darcy eventually manages to show Wickham for the cad he is, restore his own good name, and win Elizabeth\\'s love in the process; in Bridget Jones\\'s Diary, Darcy eventually manages to shows Daniel Cleaver for the cad he is, restore his own good name, and win Bridget\\'s love in the process. This isn\\'t a send up, a nod or a homage; to put it bluntly, Bridget Jones\\'s Diary is simply Pride and Prejudice reworked for 2000, and if Jane Austen is not given a writing credit in the film, it\\'s plagiarism.\"', '\"I hadn\\'t seen this for maybe 17 years or so. I remember seeing it a year after it came out and laughed like crazy. I just watched it again and some parts were funny, but not as funny as the first time. If you didn\\'t see the movies and commercials this was spoofing then most of the movie would go right over your head. I still gave it five stars because it\\'s a goofy spoof that still gives some laughs to those who know the spoofs\"', '\"It comes to this, where I have to admit that I like Sandra Bullock, she makes me laugh and I don\\'t know who could beat her in romantic comedies, she is made for them, could she be the modern Doris Day? This film has a great plot, get an FBI agent into the miss USA pageant as there is a mad man on the loose trying to kill the ladies. unfortunately the only FBI agent available is a tomboy, with no lady like qualities, that\\'s Sandra, and she does a fab job with it.Having said how much I like Sandra, this film though belongs to Michael Caine in a great role as a camp mentor to the contestants, he plays this part to perfection and should have been nominated for a supporting Oscar. The other stand out performance comes from Candice Bergen as the ever so slightly mad organiser of the show. Brilliant.So it\\'s camp, has some great acting and cameo parts and William Shatner singing through the mayhem. It can\\'t get better than that can it. So I maybe odd and I\\'m sure there are many people out there who will disagree with me, but I don\\'t care I love this film\"', '\"This movie is \"ok\", fun, an amusement. Though it does contain a couple of brilliant jokes (i.e. \"Male Models having \"Fun\" at the Gas Station), basically the movie is aims very low. There are many idiotic childish jokes, which makes you feel sometimes uncomfortable, or may cause you regrets for buying the ticket/renting the DVD. But since it is a parody, we have to accept that level. Ben Stiller is a great comedian, but in my opinion he is much more funny as a loser type, rather than the \"idiot\" type he plays in most of his movies. That is why \"Meet the Parents\" and \"There\\'s Something About Mary\" are funnier more intelligent films than \"Zoolander\" or \"Dodge Ball\".\"', '\"I was watching this movie on TV and I think that it is real entertainment for whole family or maybe for some couple because it is so funny and it has two great leading roles . Of course they are Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro . I really enjoyed in this comedy and it is one rare comedy in which you can laugh . I didn\\'t like what other actors were maybe too calm but whole story was very well connected and so funny .Ben Stiller maybe confused but he played his role on high level . It was really enjoyable to watch him in this role . He always makes movie funny when he is doing something in which he isn\\'t good . In this movie it is babysitting .DeNiro was also damn good because he was playing retired agent and he was doubting whole time . He is funny with his calm humor . I liked the part when he is testing Gaylord . It wasn\\'t his best performance but it was OK.\"', '\"Hugh Grant and Colin Firth reprise \"Pride and Prejudice\" in modern dress. Heavens, Firth\\'s character is even called Darcy!  Well, at least he didn\\'t have to rehearse his expression or learn a new character. And he still gets the girl by playing the serious, brooding type. For all that, \"Diary\" is a lightweight, pleasant but improbable diversion. Not hard to see how how Zellweger\\'s character got to 32 without getting married. Not real bright, no interests, no talent for anything much other than feeling sorry for herself. Felt like screaming \\'get a life, you dozy cow\\'. Her best feature: voluptuous figure, even if a little on the short side (similar build to Marilyn Monroe).\"', '\"I didn\\'t have the age to watch this movie when it came out. However, I can say that it\\'s still pretty funny, and entertaining. I mean, of course you need to measure your definition of \"entertainment\", for me Scary Movie is just a funny, unpretentious, silly and short film, that you can watch (as I did) without any expectations, and just to past your time or clear your head, you don\\'t need to worry about the plot, character development, or anything like this, just sit and laugh along with the jokes.That been said, I think is clear that, if parody movies are not your \"thing\" there is basically no reason for you to watch it. On the other hand, if you like this type of movie (namely the ton of other films that came out after this one), go for it, you will not regret.I think that the only downside for me was Marlon Wayans\\' character, I think he was insanely over the top even for the standards of the movie, and besides the line \"I see dead people\" I didn\\'t laugh at all with anything his character did, just didn\\'t work for me here. His brother wasn\\'t that great either, but he at least had some moments.Before I forget, a shoot out to the references in the movie (Matrix, etc etc), just hilarious.Overall, if you have 1h20 hours, and just want to clear your head, laugh and forget about your problems with a silly movie. Go for it, Scary Movie will do it.\"', '\"Saw this movie this weekend and I couldn\\'t stop laughing!  One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.  Good acting, hilarious situations, and Stiller\\'s last name made this a flic worth seeing twice! (which you will want to do if you missed some of the movie like I did from so much laughter from the audience!)  Very funny movie!  Well worth seeing!\"', '\"Although occasionally awkward, Meet the Parents really is a time well spent at the movies. DeNiro was a real winner. The film was well worth watching if only for his sake. Meet the Parents takes every nightmare of meeting your future in-laws, and sticks it together for some hilarious situations. I recommend it to all parents, in-laws, and brides and grooms to be. ;)\"', '\"In 2001, the stupid-comedy sub genre of film was changed forever by one film. That film was Zoolander, which has since become one of the most commonly quoted/referenced films among the growing number of people that have been affected by it. Never before had a comedy at this level of stupidity been attempted. In its dumbest moments, Zoolander is second to none. Where Zoolander lags is in its attempts to develop a meaningful plot and moral to the story. Luckily, this is not often and the result is a classic with countless unforgettable moments.I think Zoolander owes the majority of its greatness to its actors as opposed to the writing or directing for example, which are quite inventive at times but otherwise nothing special. Owen Wilson is arguably the heart of the film although Will Ferrel, Jerry Stiller and of course Ben Stiller have their moments. The numerous cameo appearances (most notably David Duchovny and David Bowie) also turn out to be well executed opportunities for hilarity.Now, I don\\'t think there\\'s much more I can really say about Zoolander. Some people might not like it but then they obviously just don\\'t get it. Perhaps they just need to carefully consider the question \"But why male models?\" one more time and then finally they will appreciate the inevitably apparent fact that \"Dear God ... it\\'s beautiful.\"\"', '\"It\\'s very difficult to rate a movie which is a parody of a parody.  In fact, I think that in order to rate it properly one should work out all whole new system for thinking \\'what is a good movie\\'. When I saw this one the first time I thought \\'this stinks\\'. Lots of bad puns over gays, blacks people, gangstas, bimbos and well american high school over all. In short, I thought it sucked. But then I realized that I had used the wrong measuring tools. I mean when you do a parody you have to work your mind in a special way. When your making a parody of a parody, you have to take the whole thing two steps further. And really freak out. This is what this movie has done. Although they have filled it with clichees and really cheap jokes it is done with such a selfirony and distance that one just has to applaud. This is a good parody\"', '\"How could anyone have liked this movie?!  Bad plot, bad script, bad directing, and bad acting!  If you rent this movie, not only will you be tempted to ask for your money back, you will be tempted to sue the video store for renting it, the studio for making it, and the writer for being so untalented!\"', '\"What a waste of a good actor. The humor is -very- predictable. I\\'m sure I have been more surprised at the morning coffee finding out that we ran out of sugar. Too much stereotypes.\"', '\"This is another topic which has been extremely used in cinema: a young man who wishes to marry his girlfriend but first he\\'s got to ask her parents the permission. And sometimes things don\\'t go as they are expected...By making this movie, it\\'s clear that the director Jay Roach gave the actors a free hand perhaps so as to try to compensate an unremarkable plot. The success of the movie rests on their shoulders. I would grant a special award to Ben Stiller and of course to Robert De Niro who shows that as an actor he\\'s always at ease and excellent after all these years spent in the cinema. Of course, we\\'re obliged to recognize that the humor isn\\'t always subtle, certain characters are nearly stereotyped (Owen Wilson) and the sequence where De Niro blames Stiller for not being honest whereas honesty isn\\'t his strong point appears quite conventional. As Jack Lemmon said in \"Some like it hot\" (1959): \"Nobody\\'s perfect\". But there are quite a lot of funny situations and hilarious gags.So, a mastered topic that gives a spirited comedy.\"', '\"Wonderfully hilarious comedy has DeNiro arguably in better form than he was in \\'Analyze this\\', playing the anxious father of Pam Byrnes but also understating his role, and the subtlety makes his performance even better. A great film on all facets, it really is hilarious, and a great movie. Definitely one of the best comedies of 2000, and one of the best movies.\"', '\"The problem I have with this movie, which is the only reason I give it a 9 instead of a 10, is that it\\'s only funny once. The jokes are hysterical the first time, but each time you watch it again, they become predicted and give at most an internal chuckle. Matthew Perry does a fantastic job as a character absolutely out of his mind with fear trying to get out of the situation that he has landed himself in. Bruce Willis plays the part of an ex-mafia hit-man decent enough. I don\\'t exactly believe he would be interested in tomatoes, but that doesn\\'t make the punchline of that scenario any less funny. The writing of the story line is fluid and cohesive, making an enjoyable one-time viewing.\"', '\"The film is not bad at all, with a sparkling Willis in good form ....unfortunately that actress Amanda Peet with her idiotic ever smiling mask stamped in her face brings many times the standards down...big mistake done by cast directors....she annoyed me quite much\"', '\"After watching this movie I had one question in mind, \"What the **** did I just watch?\" This movie is ridiculous! I was hoping for a few laughs (which I honestly did get in the end), but I ended up having to sit through a giant lump of crap.I am a big Ben Stiller fan, and Will Ferrell fan, and Owen Wilson fan, but why the hell would they make a movie like this? This is the kind of crap that Sacha Baron Cohen would make, but when he does it I actually laugh throughout most of the movie. Zoolander features way too many attempts at humor, but fails far too often.If you are looking for a fun, enjoyable comedy... this isn\\'t it.\"', '\"Romantic comedies seem to have a hard time in reviews, they don\\'t seem to get the truly high ratings other types of movies get. Perhaps this is because they are slightly predictable and generally wearing a bit thin.Not so this one. Helen Fielding, who wrote the bestselling novel \\'Bridget Jones\\'s Diary\\' also co-wrote the screenplay and co-produced this film, which was probably a good thing. Instead of standardized, stereotyped U.S. romantic comedy stuff, we get some truly wacky British humour, somewhere between oddball and screwball, but never in bad taste (the elk sweater early on is as bad as it gets ;-) ).Considering the number of copies Fielding\\'s book has sold, the plot probably needs little comment. Bridget Jones, age 32, tries to find a man for fear that she may die a spinster and be eaten by alsatians.Great acting from RenÃ©e Zellweger, who manages to portray Bridget as clumsy, chaotic, but also as very likeable and believable. Despite the fact that there were many traps for overacting, she managed brilliantly to come across as a person rather than a caricature. Kudos.Hugh Grant was finally cast in the perfect role. This is so much better than the type of character he usually plays. I don\\'t think he\\'s a great actor or particularly good in this film, but this role was just so perfect.Colin Firth as the other possible love interest seemed very distanced and strangely cold -- that\\'s okay considering his role, but I felt he should have thawed a bit more towards the end.Of the remaining cast, Jim Broadbent stood out in a brief, yet remarkable performance as Bridget\\'s father.All in all, one of the better comedies this year. Usually I\\'d give it an 8, but this has a serious acting bonus for a great ensemble who seemed to have enjoyed themselves, so I\\'ll give it a 9.\"', '\"To begin with,I have not yet read the book that this film was based on so my opinions are based only on the film itself.On the plus side I found the film to be quite well cast. Renee Zellweger is outstanding as Bridget. She perfect adapts a British dialouge and fall so deeply into the role that You forget she is an american.She is perky,caustic,cynical and quite fetching. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are priceless as the objects of her affections. Grant finally gets another chance to stretch his acting muscles as a vapid womanize who prove quite unloveable...and Firth finally gets another big screen role to equal \"Valmont\" or his stage performaces.He develops his character slowly and deeply throughout the film. Special attention must be given to the wonderful Jim Broadbent as Bridget\\'s Dad.Although not on screen for any length of time,It is another well drawn character in his ever growing list of great portrayals. On the down side I can only state the under developed nature of some of the supporting roles,I would have liked to see more of Bridget\\'s friends,Mother and family.\"', '\"\"Zoolander\" is a stupid, silly, ridiculous farce that has to be accepted for what it is.  It\\'s a harmless comedy with no hilarious moments, but it\\'s funny to a degree.  The problem is most of the time I found myself laughing AT the film, rather than with it.  There\\'s very little wit, and you simply have to laugh at Derek Zoolander\\'s sheer stupidity.  The plot is meandering, and seems to purposely set itself up for a million cameos.  Don\\'t get me wrong, the cameos are amusing, but it seems like Stiller was taking cheap shots by inserting big-time celebrities into every scene.  And I\\'m not exaggerating when I say this film is jam-packed with cameos.  Hell, if you made \"It\\'s a Mad Mad Mad World\" into a 90-minute feature, you very well might get \"Zoolander.\"  Just to name a few, there\\'s cameos by Cuba Gooding Jr., Christian Slater, Winona Ryder, Billy Zane, Vince Vaughn (in a disappointing, non-speaking role), Andy Dick, David Duchovny and Stiller\\'s own parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara.  I\\'m surprised Stiller couldn\\'t find screen time for his long-time buddy Janeane Garofolo.  Stiller puts his best foot forward in his lively comic peformance, and seems to be having a lot of fun, but Zoolander is a bit of a one-joke caricature and he tries his best to salvage laughs despite that.  Owen Wilson delivers a delightful comic performance as his arch rival, Hansel.  The walk-off montage between the two of them, set to Michael Jackson\\'s \"Beat It\" is my favorite moment--a very funny scene which is very well choreographed.  Of course, Stiller has to give his wife Christine Taylor a significant role.  All I gotta say is Ben--you\\'re a lucky man!  Christine is a very beautiful woman, and a charming actress to boot.  Will Ferrell is one of today\\'s best comic actors--capable of making almost scene work with his magical schtick.  I just wish he could\\'ve had more screen time as the villain Mugato.  He\\'s one of those comic actors who can make an audience laugh with a simple facial expression.  The soundtrack is great, including such great 80s hits as \"Working for the Weekends\" and \"Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.\"  \"Zoolander\" is not a great movie, nor a hysterically funny one, but it\\'s worth renting and does have its moments.  My score:  6 (out of 10)\"', '\"Absolute classic that will always be a good watch, amazing play on pride and prejudice\"', '\"This is the first film in what would become an on-going series of spoof movies parodying the latest horror films, television and popularised celebrity news, unfortunately it also gave birth to the various other terrible spoof films from the same \"writers\", e.g. Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie, Vampires Suck, but at least this film has some alright laughs. This film predominantly parodies the teen slasher movies, specifically the Scream trilogy (the fourth film came much later) and I Know What You Did Last Summer (and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), as well as spoofing or referencing Baywatch, The Exorcist (quoted), Dawson\\'s Creek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Election, Halloween, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Run Lola Run, the Budweiser \"Wassup!\" adverts, Candyman (quoted), The Blair Witch Project, Titanic, Amistad, Murder on the Orient Express, The Sixth Sense, American Pie, American Beauty, Psycho, The Matrix; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Usual Suspects, The Shawshank Redemption, Final Destination, Beetlejuice, Clueless, Cruel Intentions, The Dead Zone, Die Hard, Friday the 13th, Friday the 13th Part 2, Friday the 13th Part III, Grease, Gridlock\\'d, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, Heathers, Kids, Men in Black, Trigger Happy TV, Twin Peaks and Xena: Warrior Princess. Basically Drew Decker (Baywatch\\'s Carmen Electra) is murdered by a psycho killer wearing a Ghostface mask, her high school classmates Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), her boyfriend Bobby Prinze (Jon Abrahams), Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), her gay boyfriend Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), Buffy Gilmore (American Pie\\'s Shannon Elizabeth) and her easily angered boyfriend Greg Phillippe (Lochlyn Munro) think it coincidence that was she was killed exactly a year after they accidentally killed a man on the road and dumped his body. The psycho killer is now stalking the teens and one by one killing them and a couple of other students, and in the meantime news reporter Gail Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri) is trying to get the exclusive story with her hopeless cameraman Kenny (Dan Joffre) and seducing Buffy\\'s mentally disabled \"Special Officer\" brother Doofy (Dave Sheridan) for police information. Greg is killed at the beauty pageant, Bobby is arrested but released being innocent, Buffy is killed in the locker rooms mistaking him as a prankster and sarcastically playing along with killer clichÃ©s, and still mocks after being decapitated, Ray appears to die getting stabbed through the ear by a penis through a bathroom glory hole, and Brenda is stabbed not by Ghostface there but the various cinema-goers who are getting agitated by her constant interruptions during a film. At a house party held by Cindy to keep everyone safe a fat girl (Marissa Jaret Winokur) is killed being crushed by the opening garage door collapsing on her, Bobby and Cindy have sex and she is no longer a virgin, and Brenda\\'s stoner brother Shorty (Marlon Wayans) is in the basement with his friends as they get more and more stoned, along with the killer. Bobby turns on Shorty shooting the gun at him and killing him, and Ray turns up to join him, they corner Cindy claiming to be the ones who committed the crimes, Bobby explaining because he was refused sex and being gay with Ray, he denies this, and planning to give themselves stab wounds to look like survivors, but the real Ghostface pops up to kill them. The killer and Cindy have a Matrix style fight until he goes through the window and disappears, the Sheriff (Kurt Fuller) informs her that the killer is not the man who they accidentally killed as he is buried, then she works out that it is Doofy, and he walks out the station becoming normal and throwing away the Ghostface mask, and Cindy screaming gets hit by a car. The final moments of the film see Shorty on a surveillance camera giving a posthumous message telling the viewer three rules to help survive the situation, but he is actually explaining how to get away with a snatch-and-run, and we also see Doofy trying to break up with his first love, the vacuum cleaner he uses to masturbate, because he has fallen in love with Gail, but he does masturbate with it one more time. Also starring David L. Lander as Principal \\'Squiggy\\' Squiggman, Keenen Ivory Wayans (the director) as Slave and James Van Der Beek as Dawson Leery. This film is certainly reminiscent of the classic spoof films, like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, where most of the characters are pretty stupid and the jokes are laughably ridiculous, the best characters of the film are obviously Cindy who would go on to do three sequels with Brenda as well, Ray is funny making it obvious that he is gay, and Shorty is my favourite with his moronic personality, constantly being off his head and high-pitch voice, laugh and catchphrase \"S*** son!\". If you have seen the films being parodied it makes it all the more fun, and if you can\\'t you can simply enjoy the spoofing of all the clichÃ©s and tricks that go into real horror films, it should be noted that Scream was originally meant to be called Scary Movie, so it is good that it wasn\\'t and you can see the irony with this title, a not bad and funny horror comedy spoof film. Worth watching!\"', '\"I can\\'t say I hated this film at all, though I have a lot of pretty major problems with it. Ok, the first: I don\\'t think Briget is a likeable or sympathetic character. Her romance with Mark seems not only contrived but also lacks even the slightest chemistry or realism. Its little more than a ridiculous feminine fantasy lacking anything deeper, like actual emotion for instance. Her boss is a much more realistic and likeable figure - he makes one mistake and has to pay for it over and over again. The fact that he doesn\\'t want to settle down with Briget and get married, etc, makes him evil. Are men then meant to wait their entire lives for the perfect woman and forsake all others? Come on. Secondly, it bothers me that for an English film to be accepted by America (I class this as an English film very loosely) it seems that it has to be concerned only with the dull lovelives of obnoxious upper middle class London media types, who amount to less than 0.1% of the population. As an Englishman I see nothing of the England I know in this film, or in Sliding Doors, Notting Hill, etc. Thirdly, the music is gut-wrenchingly appalling. Having said all this, I still don\\'t hate it.\"', '\"Just a quick and easy comment. Love it, hilarious by times. Just see it.

If a character takes a wrong turn somewhere and tries to get back on course but in the process takes an even more wrong turn and fun ensues, that\\'s fine. But if a character gets lost and instead of trying to turn back decides to set his pants on fire or run over someone sitting on a park bench for no apparent reason, that is not funny to me. That\\'s why I rated Meet the Parents a 5.The main character, played by Ben Stiller, lies for no reason and then gets caught in his lies and makes them worse. He takes actions that he isn\\'t supposed to and has been warned not to do then lies when he is asked if he did so and blames something (a cat) else. And when Greg tries to find the missing cat, he quickly stoops low enough to paint a different cat\\'s tail and try to pass it off as the missing feline (why no one notices the paint smell until later that night, and then they do, is a mystery).  The guy isn\\'t especially likeable and you keep wanting to slap him and say, \"Just tell the truth! It works!\"Meanwhile, his girlfriend expects Ben (called \"Greg\" in the movie) to instantaneously act like he is a member of a family he has never met. When Greg needs clothes, his girlfriend tells him to wake up her brother -- whom Greg has never met and whose bedroom door is closed while the brother is apparently asleep -- and borrow some of his. Uh, not a good idea. Later, his girlfriend drops little bomblets on Greg, such as the fact that the best man at a family wedding is her ex-finacee (by the way, Greg never even knew that his girlfriend had been engaged), or that the dad had a different career than what she had told Greg earlier.All in all this group of characters spends a lot of time cleaning up messes that would have been easily avoided if a little truthful communication had taken place beforehand. It is that fact that kept me from enjoying any of the contrived situations that ensued. In fact, to me the funniest part of this movie was an airline gate agent who acts like, well, an airline gate agent, regardless of the actual situation around her. *That* was not contrived at all and was laugh out loud funny.\"', '\"While most of the comments I have read so far from my fellow IMDb\\'ers have been negative towards this film many of the ones I have read at a different board have not been.  I would like to suggest that, if anything, this shows that users of IMDb are significantly more knowledgeable about film than others, or at least those who happened to post messages on this particular forum that I happened to be reading not an hour ago.That said, here is my review.If you think that THIS is the best movie or one that \"rocked the theatre\" then might I humbly suggest that you increase your maturity level by 300% before seeing another movie.Granted, I admit giggling a couple (as in 2) times, but what Mr. Wayans needs to realize is that repeating other movie\\'s scripts line by line until someone farts or ejaculates does not a spoof make.I shudder to think that the future of cinema will be shaped by those who would give Scary Movie an Academy Award.\"', '\"You will not regret seeing this movie. It is so funny. From the opening scene at the hospital to when Robert DeNiro watches the video tape at the end to see if Jinx can flush the toilet it doesn\\'t let up for a second.Ben Stiller plays a male-nurse by the name of Gregg falls in love with A school teacher Pam. When he wants to ask the question to marry him he finds out he has to ask Pam\\'s father played by Robert DeNiro, Jack. When Gregg and Pam get an invite to stay at her parents house while her sister is having her wedding there that is Gregg\\'s chance. This is a comedy you won\\'t want to miss. From getting spit on from a baby to hitting Pam\\'s sister with a volleyball right in the nose to chasing Jynx on the house, losing him and bringing in a whole new cat Ben Stiller is in his best role since Happy Gilmore. 8/10\"', '\"I rented the movie and did not like it. The jokes were wasted, it felt like a Troma film (even some of those have been funny).

(I refuse point blank to watch spoofs like Scary Movie, Meet the Spartans, etc). I must admit, though, I enjoyed this film more than anticipated. Maybe mostly thanks to Sandra Bullock\\'s naturally funny acting. Maybe because Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses (just not in \\'Murder by Numbers\\', where she ruined the film in my opinion!). I also immensely enjoyed Michael Caine in this film. The interesting-ish plot was wonderfully done, me thinks. I did find Sandra\\'s bad girl impression a bit forced, as it doesn\\'t really suit her, but the \\'transformation\\' was fun to watch. The whole set-up of Candice Bergen\\'s character together with her son\\'s evil plot was a bit silly, though, and not really believable. It could have been done so much better.

A great cast and lots of laughter, Love and intense moments. A++ Film!!!\"', '\"This is a really funny movie. Sandra Bullock is truly excellent with physical humor, much the way Chevy Chase used to be in his early movies. Good script and excellent supporting cast.This film is something of a rarity. A comedy that is actually funny and witty.\"', '\"I expected this film to be quite bland but I must say that I became surprised by it\\'s qualities. The script is sharp and the humour is surprisingly intelligent with some great punchlines as well as some hilarious moments provided by the great cast. I usually hate hysterical characters but Matthew Perry shows that he is a reliable leading actor playing the extremely nervous Oz. Bruce Willis, who is always great, may perhaps not deliver the best performance of his career but he is nevertheless a fully credible lead. But this film belongs to it\\'s supporting actresses. Rosanna Arquette is overacting a bit but she still delivers a memorable portrait of Sophie, Perry\\'s bitchy wife from hell with the most horrible accent imaginable. But the real gems of this film is Natasha Henstridge and Amanda Peet who both deliver great performances. Peet\\'s performance has Oscar-potential. Not only is she really good but the Academy usually like offbeat supporting roles. Catherine Keener in Being John Malkovich is good example. Amanda Peet\\'s performance has also been critically adored which is also a good sign. Said shortly, The Whole Nine Yards is a really good (if not tremendous) movie with some minor flaws. For example, reliable actors like Michael Duncan Clarke and Kevin Pollak are both far from as good as they could have been. Still, this movie has enough assets to be worth watching at the cinema.\"', '\"Although it ends differently from the book (something I usually do not like), I really enjoyed this movie.  I laughed, the audience laughed, my husband laughed.  Colin Firth is dreamy, Hugh Grant sexy and Renee Zellweger played Bridget as she was written--I liked her, cringed for her and laughed at/with her. The slo-mo things were weird at times.  But from the first sing-along scene, I knew I\\'d like it.  The scene at the lake with Daniel Cleaver had the entire audience rolling.  Well\"', '\"This is one of the best comedies I\\'ve seen in a while. Granted, that\\'s not saying much, there haven\\'t been too many great comedies of late, but The Whole Nine Yards is a very enjoyable movie. The characters are well developed and the plot has enough unexpected little twists to keep you interested. Bruce Willis is good as Jimmy, and Matthew Perry is especially hilarious as \"Oz.\" Amanda Peet also does a good job as Jill, the contract killer in training.Now, this isn\\'t exactly an extremely deep movie that\\'s really thought provoking, and there are some aspects of the plot that I find a bit unbelievable (some stuff involving Jimmy\\'s wife...I won\\'t spoil it). But, it\\'s not a serious movie so there\\'s really no need to expect it to be too realistic. The Whole Nine Yards is simply a funny movie that you\\'ll definitely enjoy if you\\'re in the mood for something light-hearted.\"', '\"There\\'s a moment, around four minutes into Scary Movie, where Carmen Electra, playing the preprocessed meat role originated by Drew Barrymore in Scream, makes a joke about having a black boyfriend who\\'s going to beat up the psycho who\\'s taunting her on the phone. It takes several seconds to remember that for about thirty seconds Carmen Electra was married to Dennis Rodman. But when the killer turns on the pool lights to reveal the boyfriend he\\'s kidnapped, it isn\\'t Rodman, but Prince. Well, what percentage of the teen audience that made Scary Movie such a huge hit even remembers Prince before his name became a glyph? And how many remember, or care, that Carmen Electra was once musical hopeful in the Prince Paisley Palace empire. Electra, of course, has gone through several lives since then. She posed nude; she co-hosted an MTV gameshow; she was on Baywatch. Basically, Electra was the perfect star for this opening sequence. Not because she gets such a kick out of self mockery, which she clearly does, but because she is the perfect disposable (and reusable) icon for this film, which may be the most disposable film ever made.First of all, Scary Movie is funny. It\\'s frequently even very funny. In a crowded theater or crowded room, the laughter is largely wall to wall. With that out of the way, it\\'s tempting to ask if anybody is ever going to pick the film up in twenty years and still find it funny. It\\'s my guess that they won\\'t have a clue what\\'s going on. And that\\'s why Scary Movie is so sad. It\\'s hip. It\\'s current. And it sure won\\'t have a legacy.Airplane was made more than 20 years ago. It\\'s still the funniest film (in terms of laughs per second of screentime) ever made. Blazing Saddles, The Producers, and Young Frankenstein are also still amazingly funny films. Were these films funnier at the second they were released than they are now? Inevitably. All the films get much of their humour from boundary breaking. Compared to Scary Movie, they\\'re all pretty tame. They also get much of their humour from parodies of cinematic conventions. They all look 100% original compared to Scary Movie.The most hilarious thing about Scary Movie is how it reflects on the self-cannibalization rampant in Hollywood. In this case it\\'s Miramax\\'s Dimension films that represents the serpent devouring its own tail. Scary Movie, of course, is a parody of the Scream movies. And Dimension produced both the Scream trilogy and Scary Movie. Scary Movie is Dimension\\'s assurance that there\\'s no point in another Scream movie (arguably there wasn\\'t a point in the third). After all, what can you do when you get a movie that parodies a movie that parodied a genre? Nothing. You hit a dead end.Similarly, Scary Movie hits a cultural dead end. Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans (who you probably forgot directed Low Down Dirty Shame, as well as creating In Living Color) and written by several Wayans siblings, Scary Movie pokes fun at the Screams, The Matrix, The Usual Suspects, The Sixth Sense, and any number of other recent movies and commercials. The problem is that when the movie came out this summer, it\\'s Matrix jokes were already a little past their freshness date. Watching them on video, it seems positively stale. Already. Sure it\\'s funny, but for how much longer? The Usual Suspects jokes are old. The \"Wassup\" sequence will be absolutely meaningless within three years. After all, would you still get a kick out of a movie from the 80s making Spuds jokes? Or if the \"Yes I Am\" guy showed up in an early 90s movie would you laugh? Perhaps, but only at the lameness.The expiration date on Scary Movie is accelerated by the fact that the non-parody jokes (including a legion of gay jokes) are the least funny parts of the film. Scary Movie frequently mentions the fact that it\\'s a near scene-by-scene remake of the original Scream and as a result, the humour is similarly paint-by-numbers. Some of the quality slapstick will always be funny, and the stoner elements (mostly in the person of Marlon Wayans\\'s Shorty) will always have their adherents. But at a certainly point the film will hit a brick wall.I\\'m overanalyzing Scary Movie, of course. Dimension made the film on the cheap to make a quick buck. They succeeded. And, more importantly to me, people were happy with the movie. Some of the reviews were positive and audiences kept coming back from more. And despite the tag line \"No mercy. No shame. No sequel,\" a sequel is inevitable. So look at your TV or movie screen now and see what\\'s hot. That\\'s what\\'ll be mocked in Scary Movie 2, which will certainly cost a penny, make a mint, and spawn another sequel. Perhaps against all odds, one of those movies will look beyond the instant gratification of the cheap laugh  to try to create something that will last.But why would anybody want to do a silly thing like that?I give this one a 5.\"', '\"For all the people who read Helen Fielding\\'s book, this movie may seem a bit flat. While the novel greateat point was to focus on Bridget and her fellow friends\\'life, the movie is only centered on the romantic aspect.It makes an entertaining, cute and funny movie, but not something that can truly be originalAll the actors are fine. They are all funny and likeable, and Rene Zellweger portrays Bridget with great talent. Hugh Grant is charming and Colin Firth is as always perfect.The direction is correct, but not more.The weakest point of this movie come from the ending, too predictable and silly to be eprfectly enjoyable.\"', '\"I had read the generally tepid reviews, so I expected a predictable farce. Instead, I found a lot to laugh about, and some deeper content as well.  I\\'m not surprised that women are giving this movie a more favorable rating in the IMDb poll than men.  Bullock\\'s FBI agent represents what a lot of women would like to be if they dared free themselves from conventional behavior, and her eventual appreciation of the other contestants\\' value appeals to women who are put off by strident feminism\\'s criticism of the more traditional point of view.  Men, however, may appreciate less seeing some of their typical behavior towards women (such as the male agents\\' reactions to having the hidden camera in the contestants\\' dressing room.)  But I\\'m getting too heavy here.  The film is enjoyable on the surface, and well worth the time.\"', '\"for years i heard people talk about this movie and that its funny and over the top and stupid...basically just a classic dumb funny movie. well i finally got to watch this on TV in the holidays, it was on at like 10 or 10:30 and i watched it with my cousin.this movie is basically dumb and stupid...but not in a bad way. does that sound weird? anyways it definitely is a classic to remember.Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander who is a three time male-model-of-the-year who has his look that he gives (which is the same look, but don\\'t tell him that) and he ends up losing to a hippy style new male model, Hansel, played by Owen Wilson. after this loss and a tragic death of three of his friends in a fight accident at a gasoline station (somewhat disturbing) he decides to pursue higher goals in life.\"i\\'m pretty sure there\\'s more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking\".this movie follows his path of discovery and the trials in the way with some pretty funny scenes. like Derek and Hansel\\'s walk off judged by no other than David Bowie himself.Will Ferrel playing as Mugatu (with freaky hair) adds to the stupidity of this movie, as well as its strange story line.but this definitely is memorable and funny so i recommend to watch this.\"', '\"Having held the two books by Helen Fielding about Bridget close to my heart, I\\'ll admit I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie. I was excited about the casting of Colin Firth as Mark Darcy for innumerable reasons, not least of which was the question of the scene in the second Bridget book, when she interviews Colin Firth. Will they have him play himself and Mark Darcy? I wondered. But I guess I\\'ll have to wait for the (much anticipated and hoped for) sequel for the answer to that question. As the credits rolled, I immediately noticed that Andrew Davies name appeared as one of Fielding co-conspirators on the script. Knowing that he wrote the adaptation of the BBC Pride & Prejudice mini-series in which Firth played Austen\\'s Mr. Darcy, I thought that I might see something a little different from the Bridget Jones Diary I know and love so well. And right from the beginning, it appears that the intention is to cleave the books together much more than in the original incarnation. Mark Darcy is much sweeter in the book, and Bridget is much less independent. Mum gets her tv job for her, and overall she is much more reliant on her friends and family to guide her than she is in the movie. They\\'ve boiled down the story to the Bridget and her two romances, and that\\'s not necessarily a bad thing. To try to include everything would have required a four and a half hour mini-series along the same lines as P&P. I think they\\'ve accomplished what they\\'ve set out to do. They\\'ve made a happy little romantic picture based on a limited Bridget. She\\'s been Americanized so even though Renee does a great British accent and scarfs down Branston Pickle (ugh!)this movie really is most palatable to an American audience who might not take to Bridget\\'s hard-drinking and ultimately British ways.Oh and Hugh Grant was good too.\"', '\"DeNiro plays the part of a retired intelligence about to marry his daughter to the character Gaylord Focker. They claim in the movie that the character Jack used to be in the Central Intelligence Agency. But if anyone knows about the intelligence community this could be any organization authorized to operate with U.S. intelligence data.From my point of view I like to think of the actor DeNiro using and wearing his yamaka in some film to express his hidden heritage as being Jewish. As in the movie Analyze That when DeNiro ties up customers in a diamond shop. So in this movie Meet The Parents I think DeNiro again is playing the the concept of religion with the Jewish Kabbalh and Hasidism. This religious concept has the religious concept written from my research that it is common to pass on the family secrets to a son-in-law.Of course throughout the movie Jack is cautious and skeptical, which is probably common for a retired intelligence agent with world culture. The acting is pretty good creating a relaxed environment for entertainment with good setups for the short exciting action sequences.

Save yourself <length of film> - 30 seconds by watching the trailer.The trailer is funny, the film is not, in my opinion, except for these trailer bits. Be prepared to watch padded out sections, waiting in anticipation for something to be uniquely funny, as opposed to many other films of this genre, and be disappointed until you recognise something that you\\'ve seen before...from the trailer.I watched this movie waiting for sections that were funny, and just thought, \"Ah, that\\'s where it fits in with the trailer\".

Yes, I know that applies to a lot of American ones as well, but there\\'s something so quintessentially BRITISH about it by definition, right down to the wandering American star who appears in the film apropos of nothing... All of which isn\\'t intended to suggest that \"BJD\" is a bad film.  It\\'s quite the opposite in fact, it\\'s just that this particular sub-genre has been so well MINED by Brit production companies that its in danger of becoming a target for parody before too long, much as \"Scary Movie\" did with the \"Scream\" series.   Honestly, if this is your sort of thing then watch it, because it\\'s not bad at all.  I just suspect that I\\'ll be growing a little weary when I hear the phrase \\'This year\\'s Bridget Jones\\' Diary\\' trumpeted loudly about the British Film Industry\\'s \\'Great White Hope\\' for 2003.  It\\'s got a grim sense of inevitability about it, it really has...\"', '\"I can\\'t remember watching a film after which I felt less interest in the fate of ANY of the characters. The story is told without any feeling or energy whatsoever, with the sole exception of the Hugh Grant role (Daniel), and even he is far below his usual standard. Colin Firth is so wooden he has caused me to re-evaluate my opinion of the acting talent of Keanu Reeves. The film is nominally a romantic comedy, but the degree of apparent romantic attraction between Bridget and Mark (Firth) can only be described as microscopic even at the end of the film, when they\\'ve managed to get together. It\\'s also hard to see what Daniel (Grant\\'s \\'Mr. Wrong\\') sees in Bridget, who is consistently presented unattractively, with respect to clothing, behavior, physical attributes, and personality. Perhaps it\\'s that the two of them are equally shallow. As for comedy, the film (ie. the director) time after time walks away from potential significant comic scenes with a whimper, not a bang. This, after taking some pains to set those scenes up. Cases in point: the fire station interview, and the tarts and vicars party. In both of these cases we are apparently supposed to take the semi-exposure of Bridget\\'s ample backside as sufficient comic payoff for the setup. This is more like British TV humor of the Benny Hill genre than what I expect to see as humor in a major motion picture. Given all of the above, and in all fairness, there are indeed four reasons to see this film: (1) Bridget\\'s speech at the book launch, which is actually quite funny, (2) the fight between Daniel and Mark with their apologetic asides to the restaurant patrons as they trash the place, (3) Zellweger\\'s British accent, which I wouldn\\'t have thought possible, and (4) Daniel\\'s stunning book-lined apartment, which appears, unfortunately, only briefly. None of these, of course, are important.\"', '\"I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever understand why this movie got such bad reviews. Too stupid for most critics? Whatever. Zoolander is a consistently hilarious movie.Ben Stiller should have more parts like this. It reminded me of some of the hilarious stuff he did on his show (no, I didn\\'t watch it when it was first on, but I did buy the DVD when it came out). I was so glad to see him break the \"There\\'s Something About Mary\" mold of nice, regular schlub who keeps having hilariously bad luck. Derek Zoolander was miles away from this stock character. He was a brazenly stupid man who got the good fortune of having ridiculously good looks, but he couldn\\'t even turn left! One of the funniest things I\\'ve ever seen was the scene early on when he was beaten for best male model by Hansel (He\\'s so hot right now), but just walks up to the stage anyway, completely clueless about his loss (despite the fact that the loudspeaker keeps booming \"Hansel\" over and over again as he\\'s walking up. That electronic billboard he passed by with the words \"Confused Loser Zoolander Tries To Steal Award\" was classic. I thought that the movie actually had a lot of smartly written jokes.The supporting cast was great too, particularly Will Ferrell as Mugatu, who almost stole the movie (like he usually does). And Owen Wilson was great as Hansel, and so was Ben\\'s dad Jerry Stiller. Christine Taylor was fine as the love interest, but she didn\\'t really have much to do except react to the idiocy that was going on around her. I also liked the smaller parts, like Milla Jovovich as Katinka, and Jon Voigt as Derek\\'s not-too-proud dad (his reaction to Derek\\'s merman commercial, and Derek\\'s subsequent reaction, was priceless), and David Duchovny, spoofing his character on \"X-Files\" and in the bargain doing the funniest spoof of the show I\\'ve ever seen. The cast was good all around, and even though I thought the movie fell apart a bit toward the end (I think it was the orgy at Hansel\\'s place that started to lose me... I couldn\\'t see Christine Taylor\\'s character changing so abruptly), the laughs kept going to the end, and as a comedy, as well as a satire of the modeling business, I thought it performed admirably on the whole. Like I said, I think Ben Stiller should do more movies like this; for the first time in a while, I think we saw in this how much of a comedic genius he truly is.\"', '\"...or money.This is definitely not a movie for kids, nor for your parents, nor anyone with any sense of embarrassment, dignity, morals or shame. Nor is it for anyone who wants to see a good movie.  It\\'s tiresome. I heard people say \"that was cute\" more than twice on leaving the theater. That\\'s being diplomatic. It\\'s crude and, other than a few laughs, the humor is lower than sophomoric. It makes \"Dumb and Dumber\" (or \"Beavis and Butthead,\" for that matter) look like \"I Love Lucy,\" and the \"hair gel\" sequence in \"Something About Mary\" look like Victorian parlor banter.It isn\\'t a total waste, but nearly so.  There\\'s a big difference between effective parody and satire and a \"two-by-four\" of crude juvenile bathroom humor (don\\'t mention THAT, for those who have seen the movie) being beaten across your forehead.My advice: don\\'t take out the usual second mortgage to see this one.\"', '\"Although Miss Congeniality does not give anything new to viewers, considering the whole beauty pageant bit has been done time and time again, along with the gay hairdresser/make-up guy and etc, this movie is just plain fun.  Sandra Bullock, who plays tomboy like FBI agent Gracie Hart transformed into a gorgeous beauty pageant contestant, delivers a great performance.  If you haven\\'t liked Sandra Bullock in the past, after this film, I think it is nearly impossible not to love her.  There may not be much in the movie which keeps you rolling in laughter for hours, but the funny lines never stop coming, and along with that, neither does the fun. Surprisingly enough, although the plot is not unique, the actors and actresses in the film give it to you in a way that is sure to be pleasurable.  Once you see it, you\\'ll want to see it again..and again..and again.  See this one, it\\'s more than worth the outrageous ticket prices!\"', '\"Of course, as a horror fan or anyone who knows anything about horror at all, there are some funny moments as a nod.\\nMost jokes are sadly seen from miles away, but some still are unexspected.\\nThough this is quite tasteless and low intelligence, though the dumb humor makes it funny again. But watching it in 2019 means cringing at some really outdated \"memes\"/references (Matrix,WAZZUP,etc)\"', '\"Though I gave it an 8 out of 10, I am very fascinated with this flick (I intended to rate it 9). This film again consolidates my theory that the British really knows how to offer the first class romance without humiliate the audienceÂ¡Â¦s intellect. Many of American romances appeal to the sensual attraction, with poor performance and terrible story, while English counterparts usually carry on with extraordinary casting and more serious implications. B.J. is no exception. Again we see the energy and power of British actors and actresses, with whose excellent jobs enrich the texture of the whole film. Of course Renee Zellweger is brilliant, who actually enlivens the woman with all kinds of foibles but at the same time makes it impossible for viewers to dislike her. The songs fit into the story seamlessly, and cinematography and composition of certain shots are unforgettable. However there is one reason that keeps me from rating it higher. While I expected to see a female enlightenment in this film, I found the ending quite disappointing in this dimention. B.J.Â¡Â¦s success in her career is a gift offered by Darcy, and her happiness, obviously, relies mainly on her love life. I donÂ¡Â¦t know what other feminists think of this film, but I really think itÂ¡Â¦s a setback.\"', '\"I actually have always really liked this film. It is predictable and a bit on the cheesy side but there is a place for that. Not every film has to be Shakespeare. Sandra Bullock is just a flat out likeable actress and Michael Caine you could tell had a lot of fun in his role.It is just a fun movie and really in some ways about a rough around the edges woman kind of finding herself. You won\\'t care so much about the crime being solved but just the fun of the movie.\"', '\"Great series of books, great movie, and great cast!  Bridget is a less than perfect girl, seeking a more than perfect life.  She does her best to succeed in work, sex, and fun, and more often than not she does her best at failing with hilarity!

Instead, they serve up disgusting (sometimes obscene) gags that should only be funny to a nine year old, but at the same time should never be seen by a nine year old.  While watching the movie I was acutely aware of young teenagers in the audience--so much for the R rating.  I was embarrassed and worried that they were present.  This movie is guilty of what Socrates was innocent of:  corrupting the youth.  Because of its raunchiness, only adults should see this movie, but it\\'s not fit for adults to watch because it\\'s merely raunchy and devoid of humor, intelligence or wit.\"', '\"It\\'s a little slow at the beginning, but, once the plot\\'s set up, The Whole Nine Yards is a pretty funny film, though it does lose some stream near the end, too.  Of course, it helps that the film is well cast, at least in the cases of Willis, Perry, Duncan, and Peet (luckily, they\\'re the four characters with the most screen time) - Pollak and Arquette seem disinterested in their characters and deliver poor accents.Expect most of the film\\'s laughs to stem from the conversations between Willis, Perry, and Peet as most of the physical humor is pretty ordinary genre fare.  Incidentally, a lot of the jokes are fairly subtle (an aspect of the film I like), so be aware.  Also, there\\'s some good quotables here. Granted, you probably won\\'t want to watch this movie more than once, but there\\'s enough jokes here to make it worth a viewing. 7/10\"', '\"I really expected a lot more from Ben Stiller. I am surprised because I can find the humor in even the worst comedies on TV or at the movies. It seemed bland and pointless. The only thing I laughed at in the whole movie was the fact that their house looked Exactly like my girlfriend\\'s on the outside. In fact my girlfriends dad was in some ways like the guy played by Robert DeNiro. I found it even more strange that even though I related to the character in the story in some strange way, I found it to be one of the most boring movies I have seen in years. Oh well, I hope the next one is better.\"', '\"Big Momma\\'s House By Dean KishMartin Lawrence stars in his second Hollywood vehicle but can his film overcome the comparisons to an `Eddie Murphy comedy\\' or `the black Mrs. Doubtfire\\'. Lawrence stars as undercover FBI agent Malcolm Turner, who is trying to capture a nasty prison escapee and bank robber before he can escape with the money. While tracking the con, Turner discovers the bank robber\\'s girlfriend is leaving the abusive con and fleeing to her grandmother\\'s (or Big Momma) house. After assembling a stakeout outside of the grandmother\\'s house, Turner discovers that the grandmother is leaving for a trip. Panicking Turner assumes the role of  Big Momma and greets her arriving grand-daughter. Big Momma has a lot of problems. Lawrence tries his very best to try to make the material funny. It\\'s sometimes sad to see such a talented man so lost in such an ugly script. Why did Hollywood place this poor actor in this so obviously unfunny project? I can remember the 1980\\'s and the huge success of Eddie Murphy but what made Eddie so successful was that the scripts accented his unique comedic talents. In recent years, the subtler Murphy has found success with the `Nutty Professor\\' and `Dr Dolittle\\' but they have never recaptured the magic of his earlier works. I believe the key problem with `Big Momma\\' is the script and that it can\\'t seem to bring out the comedy trapped in Lawrence. Also the main comedic elements in this film are things we have seen countless times before. Some of the elements are the fat jokes, the man in the woman clothes gags and the dashing around as the main star tries to assume two identities at the same time. Some scenes are a direct rip-off of Mrs. Doubtfire with a black theme tucked in. During the cooking scene, I was waiting for Lawrence\\'s huge fake breasts to catch fire but they never did and neither did the humor. Maybe within this film there are some elements that will appeal to some audiences but for me I found the whole experience very trying. (1 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.\"', '\"I am a fan of Trey Parker and South Park, and for that reason some people would call my sense of humour \"sick\". But when I saw this movie I was severely disappointed by the overuse of offensive material that just wasn\\'t funny.My favorite parody movies are Naked Gun-type parodies. Another favorite of mine is \"Orgazmo\".Scary Movie just was not funny enough to warrant all the disgusting material. With the exception of the opening scene I didn\\'t laugh at all. The rest of the theatre laughed quite a bit, but it was mostly out of horror, shock and necessity. My laughs seemed forced. They were artificial.And to top all of that off, some of it made no sense. The \"riverdancing-in-midair\" scene made absolutely no sense.Most of the jokes were unoriginal. I\\'ve seen the Blair Witch Project flashlight scene on about ten different television shows and commercials. Why did Keenan Ivory Wayans think I\\'d laugh at it just one more time? There wasn\\'t anything special about this movie, with the exception of an overabundance of male genitalia.If you\\'re into movies with some offensive material that are ACTUALLY FUNNY you should check out some Trey Parker films, such as the under-rated \"Baseketball\". You might actually laugh at something funny.\"', '\"I must say that this movie was absolutely awful.I cant believe I actually sat through it .It wasn\\'t a little bit funny how anybody rates Owen Wilson is beyond me,I have yet to see him in anything funny,and his two mates Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are not that much better. I feel that David Bowie has let himself down appearing in this pile of trash .Could somebody please explain how they find this a little bit funny.I love stupid films (Dumb And Dumber)and great comedy films.But the only stupid thing about this was me wasting an hour and a half of my life.The only tears rolling down my face were tear of woe ,roll on the next Jim Carey movie\"', '\"Martin Lawrence is often trusty in the world of comedy.  Maybe I\\'m just overcoming his awful \"Blue Streak,\" but I felt this comedy--though saggy at times--was quite funny.  The premise is undoubtedly implausible.  How\\'s a whole neighborhood going to believe that this undercover cop with a latex body that looks somewhat like Big Momma is actually Big Momma?  There\\'s a lot of disbelief to suspend.  But the gags often worked and I can say I laughed about 75 percent of the time.  Some are predictable, like when Big Momma takes a karate class and starts beating the teacher--played by Anthony Anderson--to a pulp, but they still work due to the way they\\'re handled. And Lawrence turns in yet another fine comic performance, with a script that could\\'ve used a rewrite but was nowhere near as bad as the crackerjack script he had to work with in \"Blue Streak.\"  The talented comic helps keep the movie togehter, with a little assistance from the supporting cast.  Paul Giamatti, who was great as Pig Vomit in the acclaimed \"Private Parts,\" is funny as Lawrence\\'s partner.  We also have \"Me Myself and Irene\\'s\" Anthony Anderson and Cedric the Entertainer.  The plot is chaotic, sometimes predictable, and becomes more and more implausible by the minute but the comedy works and because of that we\\'re able to excuse the script\\'s shortcomings.  \"Big Momma\" doesn\\'t deliver the biggest laughs, but it\\'s good, fun entertainment on a lonely weekday afternoon.  My score:  7 (out of 10)\"', '\"Hollywood seems obsessed with the character type played by Ben Stiller. Supposedly intelligent but displays amazing levels of stupidity, but in the end proves that he does have a brain. I thought things were looking up with the early scene with the kids. I thought it was clever, funny and romantic, but due to the overheard comment he backs down on this planned event. His intelligence went down from there. The gags are all predictable as were the characters. De Niro & Danner give solid performances. What is it with Stiller and animals? The bit with the volleyball...one minute he\\'s a dork, the next he\\'s Michael Jordon...lame. Other reviewers have said it better than I, in summary, wait for the video. P.S. The trailer bits would have been SO much more funny if the cat DID flush...\"', '\"I watched this movie unwillingly--a friend encouraged me to see it, since I thought it was just going to be a sex-diary sort of movie. As a fan of Zellweger\\'s from \"Nurse Betty,\" I really enjoyed seeing her in this film. She looked like a \"normal\" woman, and the humor was wonderfully down-to-earth. I\\'ve never been a fan of Grant\\'s, but I was happy to finally seeing him playing the greasy playboy I\\'ve always thought he was, and happy that he DIDN\\'T get the girl! (Drove me nuts that he kept playing stuttering nice guys in all these period movies, getting all dressed up and looking innocently lost. Gag.) But the guy who DID get the girl... \"Ummm,\" I thought (since I was unable to really get out a coherent thought :), \"Who IS this guy?!\" He gets the girl in this movie opposite two well-known movie stars, and I\\'ve never heard of him before!? So I wandered over to the IMDb and discovered Colin Firth (and \"Pride and Prejudice\"! WATCH THIS MOVIE!! :), and have never been the same since. :) People wrote articles asking the question: \"Grant or Firth?\" and I snort. Firth, of course. Hands-down. No competition, and there never was. Grant is just an overly-confident British guy with a posh accent. Firth...is worth admiring. The final sequence of the film with him in that great coat and turtleneck and look oh so...um... Anyway, that whole sequence makes up for all of the grating you have to endure for Bridget\\'s sake to get through the Grant parts to the really good parts at the end of film, when Grant\\'s character is finally out of the picture.In any case, all three actors (and the supporting cast) do a really wonderful job with this movie. You will laugh--guys AND girls--and not mind watching it again. I\\'ve never before seen a fight scene like the one this movie has. Downsides: a lot of obscenities. Otherwise, though, this is a really fun movie. And you have to appreciate the whole \"Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy\" background to understand how truly ironic and wickedly funny this movie actually is. There is a whole subculture in the female English-speaking world surrounding Mr. Firth, and this film capitalizes (and is actually partially based on) this subculture. Bridget Jones is the embodiment of 30-something unmarried females who love watching \"Pride and Prejudice.\" :) Enjoy!\"', '\"A bomber is targeting the Miss America beauty pageant and Agent Matthews selects tom boy Fed Gracie Hart to go undercover as a contestant. First, however, Gracie must be shown the ropes by disgraced pageant expert, Victor Melling.\\nOver in America, this slight comedy restored some of Sandra BullockÃ†s box office lustre. A genuine crowdpleaser boasting a charming star turn, Miss Congeniality is indeed difficult to dislike, but hey, sometimes it\\'s worth the effort.Much more believable as a beauty queen than a scruffy, ill-mannered Fed, Bullock snorts sweetly and falls off high heels very well. Which is just about enough to carry the first 30 minutes. After that it would be nice if the script gave her something else to do.There are some incidental pleasures away from the leading lady: the screenplay mines broad comedy from the all-American crassness of beauty contests - although the film won\\'t criticise them too far; the banter between Bullock\\'s bumbling cop chums is amusing; and the growing rapport between Bullock and Caine\\'s gay makeover expert is nicely, if programmatically, played out. Moreover, it\\'s good to see Candice Bergen and William Shatner shine as fading pageant hosts. That said, there is a completely inconsequential feel to the whole exercise.There are too many storylines, too many characters, too much sentiment: Miss Congeniality is a prime example of moviemaking by committee, a disease which kills comedy in particular. Each teeny character has their own little arc, each identifiable audience demographic is pandered to with a story beat here, or a cameo there. Baloney.Do we care whether the shy contestant who befriends Bullock comes out of her shell? Do we care if Caine\\'s character restores his pride and prestige? Do we even care if Bullock and Bratt get together?No matter. This is not a complicated story - it\\'s about a tom boy Fed who shaves her legs in order to go undercover at a beauty pageant, gets into a few scrapes, falls over a lot. And whenever director Petrie remembers this fact and points the camera at his engaging star, his film is good, easy-on-the-brain fun.Gossamer-thin entertainment of the sort that would make for an inoffensive first-date movie. Nice to see Sandy back on home turf, but this is unlikely to give Julia Roberts sleepless nights.\"', '\"I thought that this movie was so funny and the acting was uplifting, it lived up to everything it was advertised as and also what I thought it would be like.

Do you convulse with laughter when you see someone have a nervous twitch?  If you said yes to both those questions then The Whole Nine Yards is the movie for you! Unfortunately the film is not the smart, intriguing comedy that the previews set it up as.  The film does have two high points, namely Bruce Willis and Michael Clarke Duncan who do a commendable job portraying contract-killers. Unfortunately the rest of the cast does not bring the same charisma to the movie and Matthew Perry in particular is extremely disappointing in the lead role.  The Whole Nine Yards tries to be too many things: comedy, mystery, romance and action.  Instead of being a quality film in one of those genres it tries to hard to combine the four and winds up faltering.  If you went into this movie and didn\\'t know what it was about, there\\'s a good chance you could enjoy parts of it, but if you expect an intelligent comedy you will be sorely disappointed.\"', '\"Not a chick flick but something we can all relate to.

Derek Zoolander is on his way down after three years of continuously winning the \"Male Model of the Year\" award. He has been beaten by the hot newcomer Hansel and starts searching for a new meaning in his life, because he wants to give up modeling. But exactly now, the biggest of all fashion tycoons, called Mugatu, wants him in his show... at least that\\'s what they all think. In reality Zoolander will have to kill the new Malaysian Prime Minister on his visit to New York, so that cheap child labor is still available for Mugatu\\'s fashion producing. But a smart and beautiful journalist finds out the truth and will try to stop Zoolander...It\\'s probably me, but in this entire movie there was only one moment that made me laugh out loud. For the rest of the time this movie only annoyed me. There really wasn\\'t much that appealed to me in this movie and I had the feeling that they only wanted to make this movie more interesting by adding some stars or famous people like David Bowie, Lenny Kravitz, Donald Trump, Tommy Hilfiger, Paris Hilton, Heidi Klum and many many more. The acting from Stiller is the same as always, so you exactly know what to expect, but the story of the movie doesn\\'t make too much sense and didn\\'t do it for me. I give this movie only a 2/10. I\\'m sure many will love it, but I certainly didn\\'t.\"', '\"True to the book and appealing to non-reader\\'s of Fielding,too and newcomers\\'s too. If Notting Hill is a 10 this a 13.

While Ben Stiller simply acts retarded as Derek Zoolander (that whole \"D-A-I-Y-E\" scene made me want to throw my shoes at the screen), Wilson applies his unique brand of charm to his character, which is just about the movie\\'s only saving grace.\"', '\"A decent but uneven comedy about the fashion industry, celebrity culture and male modelling. One cannot accuse the various makers of cluelessness or ignorance : many of their barbs are well-aimed and spot-on. (The various grin-inducing costumes are particularly successful.) It\\'s clear that these people did their homework, bigly.The plot about child labour - where do you think your clothes come from ? - is not treated with the depth and seriousness due to such a subject, but at least the movie is brave enough to mention the elephant in the room, which is more than can be said about many fashion- or lifestyle-related comedies. It\\'s a deeply depressing thought that the global situation has not improved since 2001, in spite of all the promises and campaigns.Ben Stiller is superb as a male model with incredible cheekbones and less brains than God gave to a baby mouse. Watch his merman commercial about \"Moisture is the essence of wetness\" - it\\'s one for the ages... Also priceless : the line about bulimia (\"So you can read minds ?\").\"', '\"`The Whole Nine Yards\\' just doesn\\'t go the distance.  Short of a first down, it never gets close to scoring a touchdown.  In fact, it barely has enough kick for a field goal.  Cracking a smile here and there, it\\'s one of those run-of-the mill comedies you forget the minute the clock runs out.The lead performances are efficient but smack of dÃ©jÃ\\xa0 vu.  By now Bruce Willis has a patent on the cool, smirking, know-it-all tough guy and he barely lifts a finger here to do anything effortful.  You know his game. And though he has top billing as an infamous contract killer on the lam, he pretty much passes the ball to Matthew Perry, in typical sheepish form, as an innocent dentist by trade who, goaded by a greedy, acrimonious wife, gets caught up in new neighbor Willis\\' murder-for-hire imbroglio.  Granted, we\\'ve seen THIS Perry many times on TV (his comedy bag of tricks is littered with little \\'Chandler\\'-isms), but he is still an undeniably talented and appealing actor.  Somehow Perry manages to hustle on the field a bit, pulling off some great (if not always fresh) physical schtick and reaction shots along the way.   He is the comedy quarterback in this film.But while Perry and (to a lesser extent) Willis front the team decently enough, the featured cast comes off more like bench-warmers than players -- supportive but ineffectual.  A tightly-coiled Kevin Pollak as Willis\\' `brutal\\' nemesis carefully toys with his eyebrow to establish his character\\'s menace and that\\'s about the extent of it.  The usually interesting and offbeat Rosanna Arquette is jarringly ineffective and annoying as all get out as Perry\\'s nasty, ungrateful Gallic spouse anticipating the joys of widowhood.  Her talent for comedy is suspect here and highly questionable too is her attempt at a foreign accent (ditto Pollak).  Michael Clarke Duncan, who was so poignant in `The Green Mile,\\' has yet to find an equally rewarding part, finding himself typed yet again as a looming behemoth.  Though his henchman gets to play both sides of the war zone, his role is pittance and adds little to stir up the proceedings. Natasha Henstridge starts off promisingly as a femme fatale type, but her character quickly turns to jelly and peters out by film\\'s end.  Amanda Peet\\'s idea of comedy is to use a lot of overt facial gestures, mugging shamelessly throughout.  Memorable more for her gratuitous topless scenes, at least she and Henstridge fill the bill as fetching eye candy.Director Jonathan Lynn\\'s comedy record has been rather mediocre thus far -- some hits (`My Cousin Vinny\\'), some misses (`Sgt. Bilko\\'), mostly errors (`Clue\\').  Add this to the list of errors.  The gags tend to strain for laughs, the set-ups are frequently pat, predictable and calculated, and the situation covers old ground (1979\\'s `The In-Laws\\' starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin).  After a somewhat diverting first half, the story dries up, running out of clever maneuvers.  I\\'d say a passable time-filler at most.However, if you are a Matthew Perry fan, get out the popcorn, the beer and the pennant because he IS the entire game.\"', '\"This film is one of the funniest films that i have seen, the film stars Academy Award winner Robert DeNiro, Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Blythe Danner and Owen Wilson. The film starts of with male nurse Gaylord \"Greg\" Focker (Stiller) wanting to marry Pam (Polo)but to do this he must first ask Pam\\'s ex CIA agent father Jack (DeNiro) for her hand in marriage. Gaylord\\'s quest for approval gets sidetracked as Murphey\\'s law takes over and a whole string of mishaps begin to happen. The jokes about Gaylord\\'s name never get tiring in this film and both Stiller and DeNiro give great performances, from the director of the Austin Powers Trillogy Jay Roach comes another hilarious film, I recommend to anyone who hasn\\'t seen this movie to go out and find a copy. I give Meet the Parents 7/10\"', '\"BEWARE! GREAT BIG SPOILER! (Especially for Stiller fans)Indeed. How stupid does Ben Stiller actually think his paying audience is? \\'Zoolander\\' is THE worst film I have seen in a very long time. Considering that Mr. Stiller has done some really good comedy, one might like to think that the film could have been extremely funny, since the idea of using the fashion industry as a frame for a comedy does indeed have a lot of potential. However, what was a good concept turned into a film full of unoriginal slapstick, clichÃ©s, one-dimensional characters and dialogues bordering on cretinism. Who ever told Mr. Stiller that outright stupidity was funny? Isn\\'t it the very essence of comedy to present us with more-or-less normal, everyday characters - people one can identify with - who find themselves in situations which, once again, one might be likely to experience onesself? In short, isn\\'t it just about caring for the characters and feeling with them? Mr. Stiller, however, preferred to exaggerate a potentially lovable and dim yet good-hearted character, thereby turning him into a more- than-anything-else stupid, stupid, stupid character hardly anyone could care less about. And a character I couldn\\'t care less about is just plain boring. And bored I was. I waited in vain for something resembling a catharsis at the end, just to make me feel the film hadn\\'t been an utter waste of time and money, but any hint of character development obviously was not the prerogative of \\'Zoolander\\'. (A comparison with \\'Legally Blonde\\' might be appropriate at this point, as the main characters could be seen as being similar. However the \"dumb blonde\" played by Reese Witherspoon sets out to achieve something, learns and matures through the course of the film, and turns out to be not quite the dim-wit she seemed. Derek Zoolander on the other hand constantly confirms our hunch that he might possibly be a complete and utter moron.) So, add to all this a weak plot, lack of suspense, overacted and stereotypical characters and a kind of banal humour which can only be seen as an insult to any adult and you have \\'Zoolander\\', a film I would not even bother watching on TV.  Not even if I were bed-ridden for a month, with 39Â° fever, no good books around and nothing better to do. Sorry, but not even in such a situation would I want to be taken for a fool.\"', '\"Ok, we already seen thousand times the story of a ugly girl becoming a beautiful one. With Sandra Bullock in the movie, it was at least funny. This is the kind of character that she likes to play. She is not afraid of looking ridiculous, unlike many actresses. Benjamin Bratt, Michael Caine and Candrice Bergin are very good in their characters. The love story is inevitably clichÃ©, but it didn\\'t bother me that much.So for a great acting, a most of the time clichÃ© plot and many funny moments, I give 7 out of 10 to this movie.\"', '\"I went into this movie expecting to find a sad and funny tale of loneliness. What I got was an atavistic lecture in antediluvian sexism. Never mind if a woman is slovenly, overweight, smokes, drinks, and totally inept: all that matters is that if she appears pathetic enough, and speaks like a sex kitten, she will snare The Right Man (older, richer, smarter, and higher class) who will then Fix Everything. The last scene says it all: Bridget in Underwear in Snow Embraced by Protector. Please. As for men who do not fit the perfect mold, well, they\\'re Losers and don\\'t deserve sex. And as for attractive, competent women, well, they\\'re \"Stick Insect\" castrating witches.This movie displays a reversion to sexual politics as crude and pathetic as anything I\\'ve seen post-feminism. Its myopism is the funniest thing about it. Bridget can hardly see that she is imitating perfectly her mother\\'s choices and is headed for exactly the same misery. Maybe that is the film\\'s subtle message, but I won\\'t give it the credit of being that intelligent. Too bad, because the cast are all fine actors.\"', '\"i don\\'t how on earth this movie is getting a 6.6 on this site. this movie was hilarious. it had all the great stuff you\\'d expect from ben stiller. add to that owen wilson, who is easily one of the funniest actors out there, and you have a great movie. if you don\\'t already know this whole movie is based on a skit stiller did at the vouge fashion awards. i didn\\'t see the skit, so i thought it wouldn\\'t be that good, plus the trailer makes it look pretty dumb. thankfully this movie was as funny as any movie to come out this year. i don\\'t know what else i can say without giving away too much, other than will farrel was funnier than ever, and the whole movie was ben stiller at his best. go see it.                                              10/10\"', '\"...

Now having seen it, I still don\\'t know why people quote this movie. I rented the movie knowing full well that I have never liked Ben Stiller in any movie I\\'ve seen him in. This movie was completely laugh-less for me, except for one part I can\\'t quite recall (might\\'ve been the part where Zoolander and Hansel were trying to use the computer).The only bright point for this movie was the cast (except for Stiller and Wilson). I thought making Jerry Stiller Zoolander\\'s agent was a great choice, and the tons of celebrity cameos I felt were wasted on such a bad movie (Paris Hilton, Natalie Portman, Fred Durst, Lance Bass, and ESPECIALLY David Bowie). In fact, 2 of the three stars I\\'m giving it are for all the cameos, because I love me some cameos.All in all, a terribly disappointing movie.\"', '\"I missed this when it came around first time but watched it recently with a friend who extolled its virtues. I don\\'t have anything personal against the Ben Driller brand of comedy but I do find Will Farrell hugely overrated. This Mugatu character was painfully unfunny, I felt awkward seeing Ferrell and the Ballstein chap on screen. Granted, I chuckled at some of the set pieces but for a supposedly successful comedy, it didn\\'t click with me.\"', '\"Just the idea of making a parody of Scream should get you suspicious. Scream is already a heavily self-ironic movie, which is part of its greatness. Making fun of a movie already this self-ironic is a difficult matter. It can be done, but this is a very bad attempt.This movie is essentially Scream covered with stupid sex jokes and lame references to other movies. They routinely manage to spoil even the potentially good scenes with disgusting infantile  \"jokes\", if that is what to call them.If you manage to sit-through the whole movie, you will probably find some scenes you find funny, but overall this is a disastrous movie, the world would be better of without. (1/10)\"', '\"Vanity project for Ben Stiller, one of my least favorite comedic actors of all time. Stiller has one joke and that one joke is a facial expression. That should tell you where he\\'ll rank in the pantheon of comic greats. Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell aren\\'t much better. Oh and there\\'s a ton of celebrity cameos because...that\\'s comedy now, I guess? Obviously I\\'m in the minority as a lot of people seem to love this. If you\\'ve never seen smug celebrities being smug or Ben\\'s one joke before, then please watch this movie.

I wouldn\\'t recommend this to anyone.\"', '\"\\'Scary Movie\\' is a teenage film which parodies horror films, such as \\'The Sixth Sense\\', \\'The Blair Witch Project\\', and others. The film is about a group of teenagers who are being stalked by a killer. There is a large cast of characters who end up in different situations and who risk to avoid being killed off. This is another one of those throw-away films that you will either love watching a couple times or hate before it is finished. It\\'s generally a film for teenagers with some crude humor and situations, which can be funny if you appreciate that sense of humor. There is no artistic merit here nor any novelty. It\\'s one of those that have ended up in the discount racks where you buy your DVDs.\"', '\"Every scene that would of made me laugh, I already saw on tv two weeks before.  They take line for line dialogue right out of the scream movies and change the plot a little by using a penis to kill someone instead of a knife.  Total rip off!\"', '\"First of all, I must say that a thought Matthew Perry was great in this film as Nicholas \"Oz\" Oseransky, the bumbling, good-guy dentist, who just wants to do the right thing.  Bruce Willis was also in a good role as Jimmy \"The Tulip\" Tudeski, the ruthless Hungarian Mafia hitman.  Oz is a really funny character with a knack for trouble following him.  The movie starts out with Oz finding out that Jimmy \"The Tulip\" has moved in next door.  Oz is scared out of his mind and wants to move  away, but his \"charming\" wife Sophie has something else planned for him.  Sophie tells Oz to go to Yanni Gogolack in Chicago, a Hungarian mobster with a score to settle with Jimmy, and rat out Jimmy\\'s whereabouts to Yanni.  Of course, everything goes awry and the plot twists and turns in a hundred directions, until the rather predictable, yet decent ending.  The movie has some really funny parts and a well-moving plot, as well as likeable characters.  Go see it for a light-hearted evening.\"', '\"This movie is absolutely horrible.  There is no redeeming value to this movie.  It was probably the worst of the summer.  The jokes were not funny, the plot was weak, and of course the acting was terrible.

Shawn and Marlon Wayans are hilarious, loved them in the Wayans Brothers TV show. This movie is hilarious, it takes all those teen horror flicks and parodies them. What movies does it parody you might ask, well flicks like \"Scream\", \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" and the unforgettable, \"The Sixth Sense\".I love Anna Faris as well, she\\'s so talented, hard to believe this is her first movie. She\\'s very funny, Baywatch fans will love Carmen Electra in her cameo role. Jon Abrahams, he\\'s very funny to, all around good guy. Lochlyn Monroe, totally loved him in this, Shannon Elizabeth too, she\\'s great at doing a parody of Sarah Michelle Gellar.The movie is pretty funny, if you thought \"Scream\" was pretty hokey, you\\'ll love this movie, it\\'s pretty good. It does have some toilet humor, but hey, what teen movie doesn\\'t. It\\'s really funny. I remember when this movie came out on VHS, I had to rent it at least 3 times, before I bought it, just so I could show everybody how funny it was. There\\'s a lot of great lines, as well great acting, oh they also parody the \"Matrix\" it\\'s good. Watch it and see how many movies you can see that they made fun of. It\\'s great.\"', '\"Gosh, this movie is awful.  I cannot stress it enough.  \"Scary Movie\" calls itself a parody.  It\\'s not.  I really don\\'t know what it is.  It tries to parody the \"Scream\" series, which is, in fact, a parody of slasher flicks! How can you make a parody out of a parody?The only good thing that I have heard about this film is that it is funny. Well, I guess it is pretty funny if you\\'re still calling your friends poo poo heads.  This is a rated R movie (a very rated R movie at that), so I don\\'t think the Wayans brothers were trying to target an elementary school audience.  What were they trying to do?

OK I thought it was pretty well written for the most part, but it does have it\\'s fair share of Plot holes, however just enjoy it for what it is a highly entertaining film, that\\'s meant to entertain!. I thought it was hilarious when Sandra brought in pizza and took the Pageant contestants out partying and drinking, plus it also amusing when she kept falling and tripping.

There\\'s a lot of talk on the IMDb about it being the funniest comedy ever and the best film of its decade to date, but in all honesty such talk is rather naÃ¯ve. Instead, Meet The Parents comes across as a solid, enjoyable comedy of errors. Anyone who watches a lot of comedies will see some of the punch-lines a mile off, but the performers demonstrate a nice sense of comic timing that raises a smile from even the more obvious gags.Male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) plans to propose marriage to his steady girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). However, she mentions during a conversation that her father is a very traditionally-minded man who believes that potential \"suitors\" should ask his permission before proposing to his daughters. Greg decides to accompany Pam on a weekend visit to her parents\\' place, hoping to make a good impression in their eyes before asking for their approval in his plans. Pam\\'s father Jack (Robert De Niro) turns out to be a pretty intimidating guy, and things only get more and more awkward for Greg when he learns that his future father-in-law is an ex-CIA interrogator. Trying too hard to make a good impression, Greg almost always invariably does just the oppositeÂ…. an attempt to shower everyone with champagne results in a vase containing Jack\\'s mum\\'s ashes getting smashed; a game of water volleyball ends with Jack\\'s other daughter getting her face wounded; an innocent cigarette causes some pretty disastrous fire damage to the Byrnes\\' house; etc, etc. Ultimately, Greg causes so much unintentional havoc that he virtually shatters his chances of being accepted by the Byrnes.The film is actually based on a rarely seen low-budget 1992 film of the same title. Here it gets a more polished makeover, though is not necessarily the better of the two films. Stiller is likable in his accident-prone role while De Niro shows a nice flair for comedy as the terrifying father. Polo doesn\\'t have a great deal to do as the girlfriend, since her role mostly consists of hugging the insecure Greg and assuring him that he\\'s doing great, and Blythe Danner is similarly under-used as De Niro\\'s sweet-natured wife. Of the lead actors, the other one who has the best of things is Owen Wilson, in a small but amusing part as Pam\\'s ex boyfriend. In essence this is a situation comedy of the kind seen on TV virtually every day, but scaled-up with A-list stars and an expensive, cinematic sheen. The script contains some funny one-liners which the actors seize upon with plenty of verve, and Jay Roach directs it with the pace and confidence he invested in his Austin Powers movies. Meet The Parents is plenty of fun, especially when treated on its merits, but you shouldn\\'t be hoodwinked into expecting the comedy-to-end-all-comedies. If that\\'s what you expect and demand of the film, you may come away feeling a little let down.\"', '\"Has Ben Stiller made a good movie yet? Not so far as I can tell. He is living proof that nepotism works. Even though his dad has never been that funny either. How he continues to make movies is beyond me, all he does is string together a series of events that have shock value but no real humor. Plus teaming him up with Owen Wilson is a double negative. Let\\'s see: he\\'s not a good actor, he\\'s not a funny comedian, he\\'s not cute enough to get by on his looks... Explain why people continue to waste money on any film he pollutes. Somebody told me that dodgeball was funny, it had it\\'s moments and it was one of Stiller\\'s best--which ain\\'t saying much... It stills sucked! And so does he!\"', '\"I never imagined the death of feminism would be celebrated socheerfully.  And by women, yet.  Renee Zellweger\\'s warmth andtalent only compound the heartbreak.  Nearly everything else aboutthis film, down to the sound effects, is false, degrading or irritating. Watch this back to back with, say, SEX AND THE SINGLE GIRL orsome equally smarmy 60s sex farce and ask yourself, \"Is thisprogress?\"\"', '\"Just when I thought that \"fat, drunk and stupid\" wasn\\'t the way to \"go through life\", cinema provided me the perfect example of a man doomed for failure. His name? Gaylord Focker. His profession? Male nurse. How does he look? Slightly below average, but a Tom Cruise, he ain\\'t, if you except some pretty blue eyesÂ… no really, he looks like that poor schmuck who thought he had a chance with Cameron Diaz in \"There\\'s Something About Mary\" Â… see? What else from that glorious portrait? Well, he\\'s in love with Pam (Teri Polo), a pretty blonde from a Conservative WASP family, and being Jewish wouldn\\'t help either. Except that she loves him, she would probably say \\'yes\\' if he manages to propose her, granted Pam\\'s sister doesn\\'t steal her thunder and the ring doesn\\'t get lost with the luggage in the airport Â… yes, I forgot to mention Greg (that\\'s how they call him) is also unlucky but that was quite easy to find out. Anyway, Pam loves him and her sister\\'s wedding seems like the perfect opportunity to introduce Greg. Except that opportunity doesn\\'t rhyme with formality, there has to be a catchÂ… otherwise, the film wouldn\\'t be one of the funniest of the 2000\\'s.The catch is a hard-nosed man in his early sixties, who loves his wife Dina (Blythe Danner), his two daughters and Jinx, his Siamese cat. He\\'s over-protective and over-suspicious, he\\'s a Conservative Christian, and much more than this, he\\'s an ex-CIA Agent. His name is Jack Byrnes and he\\'s played by Bobby De Niro, who else could? \"Meet the Parents\" all relies on the antagonism between Greg and Jack and it follows a simple yet effective pattern: whatever Greg does, he\\'ll be ridiculous. No matter how hard he\\'ll try to make himself within the family circle, Jack\\'s beloved concept, he\\'ll end up displeasing him. It feels like a one-note approach to the subject, but for some miraculous reason, it never feels redundant and here\\'s why.The credit goes to Jay Roach, the director, each scene prepares us to a funny pay-off. Secondly, there\\'s not one single \\'funny\\' character, they\\'re all, within their own state of mind, normal and well-meaning persons. One might argue that a CIA agent who trained his cat to use the toilet might be a little twisted, or a name like Gaylord Focker is too funny not to belong to a goof-ball, but fact is, there\\'s no clown in the film, the two opposite leads are straight men with clearly defined personalities. The average schmuck who wants to propose the blonde daughter and must get the approval of the father, and the conservative father who believes his baby girl deserves the best.The comedic situations result in all the interactions between Greg and Jack, and their one-sided attempts to get along. There is a family dinner scene that crystallizes whatever is funny in the film, Greg tries to make a joke, he ends up insulting Greg\\'s mother, he start talking about a random subject such as \\'milking\\' cat, making the gesture as if we didn\\'t get it, and arguing that you can milk anything with nipples to which Jack\\'s \"I have nipples, Greg. Could you milk me?\" is the perfect comeback and the film\\'s most memorable line. There\\'s also a jar containing Jack\\'s mother ashes which makes us expect the worstÂ… but the point is to laugh, not at Greg, but at his desperate attempts to accommodate with his soon-to-be family-in-law. The film is never mean-spirited, well, maybe a little but, but we never laugh in a mean-spirited wayÂ… I think soÂ…I believe one of the reasons the film succeeds is because the recurring theme is being an outsider, which is a situation most viewers can relate to. And meeting the parents of your beloved one is probably one of the nightmares everyone must get through once in the life, the issue is undermined by Greg\\'s differences, which are never mocked, he\\'s proud of his job, which is all to his honor. He\\'s Jewish but accepts to say the blessing, although it doesn\\'t really turn out as we\\'d expect. The point is that there are more cultural gaps in America than anyone would believe, and at a time, where \\'mixed\\' marriages are so common, it\\'s also something many can relate to. And God, what can be worst than a lie detector test from your father in law? The film introduces Pam\\'s sister and her future husband, a doctor (a real one, from Jack\\'s perspective), the ideal man for his daughter, there\\'s also Owen Wilson as a priest and carpenter who lived a passionate romance with Pam, \\'only physical\\' (was that supposed to comfort him?) and Jack\\'s son who\\'d be responsible for a minor drugs\\' subplot, not the best part of the film. Indeed, it loses its pacing at some point where Greg becomes the public enemy number one, Greg, but then it takes us to a hilarious airplane climax where Greg finally goes berserk and vent his anger out on flight attendants and a last and final confrontation with Jack.Ben Stiller has already proved his value as a character â€“actor for poor and well-meaning schmucks, he reprises his role from \"There\\'s Something About Mary\" but gives it an even deeper feeling. De Niro has no comparable talent to make fun of his own intimidating presence and knows how to parody his own gangster mimics for grabbing a few laughs. He was rightfully nominated for the Golden Globe. Blythe Danner also provides a sweet touch as the understanding mother who asks Jack to \"go easy on Greg\", but fate is that no matter what can go wrong, it all go wrong. Murphy\\'s law indeed.And if one thing, the film proves right the idea that marrying someone, no matter what we want, is also marrying the family.\"', '\"Don\\'t have a chance to see it at the cinema, then get it at home video. This movie is one of the most enjoyable and comical comedy i have ever seen. The story is excellent, goes as plan and the casts are well picked too. They all act perfectly.Haven\\'t seen much of Mr DeNiro movie on comedy, he obviously did a very good job in this one, like him much in his character.The part in the airport is also one of the best. The acts seem pure and original.Worth it and excellent movie, well done.\"', '\"A horrifying example of a chick movie. I admit that I kind of like it when I first saw it on 2001, and gave it a good rating and review for IMDb. However, viewing the movie again a number of times over the years showed me there are many things that are wrong with this film. Look, Renee Zellweger has a good performance (though right now, her cinematic persona has kind of overstay her welcome). The plot is basically about Bridget having to choose between dour lawyer Darcy (Colin Firth) or sexy cad Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Neither of them is a very satisfactory individual. Arguing who was the best guy for her, as I did in my original review is besides the point. Besides, what is more off putting about this film is that Bridget stupidity is supposed to be representative of the modern woman. I want to believe that this is not true, but unfortunately, the huge success of this film shows that many women agree with that judgment. (in order to not be totally negative about this movie, let me say that the sequel is way worse).\"', '\"Matthew Perry is going to have to live with a curse.  That curse is that whenever you see him, you think of \"Chandler Bing\".  The moment I knew that this was a good movie was when I no longer saw him as Chandler but as Oz.This movie is not a laugh a minute.  But it is without a doubt a giggle a minute with a few fall down laughs.  It is cute and funny and somehow makes hitmen lovable. The cast is well put together even though Kevin Pollack\\'s little speech impediment is a tad annoying.  Yet the cast meshes regardless.  And if you don\\'t cheer when OZ gets the girl (I will not reveal which one) you might have lost some mirth in your heart.  Maybe this movie will help bring it back.\"', '\"The whole film is a parody of the horror movie \"Scream\" with a few altered segments from other films combined and a slightly different twist at the end, to try and create a more unexpected finish. Overall the plot isn\\'t the best (although parodies of other movies are adeptly entwined into the film) and the acting is far from great (but in a film such as this that can be excused and perhaps even makes the film seem all the better), the overall effect creates an extremely crude and funny movie that\\'d be great if you\\'re looking for just one night to relax and lighten up, with some hilarious moments and great adaptations of other movies. But all in all it\\'s just a parody that\\'s been stretched to a movie length that you may or may not find funny, depending upon what you are expecting from the film, and though it may make you laugh uncontrollably for some time it\\'ll just be a movie that you\\'d forget about shortly after.\"', '\"Zoolander (2001)A preposterous and often hilarious (and often very goofy) comedy set in the world of high fashion. And international politics, kind of.Ben Stiller is the title character, and he\\'s so affected and \"stupid\" he\\'s perfectly funny. Even when he makes the same move with his head, pursing his lips and looking blankly across the room, over and over, it\\'s funny. Every time. He has to deal with being exceedingly stupid, vain, good looking, and now, suddenly, unsuccessful.He loses his \"crown\" as best model to Hansel, played by Owen Wilson. He also manages to very be funny, though less by acting and more by having an absurd role â€”new hippie hedonist. As supermodel. Okay, whatever!There is an extremely dull if pretty reporter who is looking into this fashion world, especially a bizarre Mugatu character played by Will Ferrell. Evil ensues. David Bowie shows up for a contest. A whole slew of actual fashion names lend themselves for cameos. It\\'s a rollicking movie. It even makes a little sense, which is good because it doesn\\'t need to, and we want the resolution to happen.And oh yeahâ€”you get to relax to Frankie Goes to Hollywood, the perfect empty hyped up pre-techno dance studio bland band, which has a key role, via vinyl. Milla Jovovich has a small role that\\'s a little like Uma in \"Kill Bill\" and her name is worth the ride: Katinka Ingabogovinanana. Look for little appearances by big names: Christian SLater, Donald Trump, Jon Voight, Natalie Portman, Paris Hilton (duh, yeah!) and Heidi Klum (her too), Fabio, Lenny Kravitz, K-Roc, Richie Rich, Billy Zane, Vince Vaughn, and so on! Is this any good? I suppose not. But what are comedies for? To make you laugh. And this does that enough times to make it worth the suffering elsewhere if you hunker down and don\\'t worry too much. And there\\'s even a sequel.\"', '\"stars:Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell, Mila Jovovich, David Duchovny, Jerry Stiller, Jon Voight, David Bowie, Billy Zane and Vince Vaughn. cameos: Natalie Portman, Christian Slater, Steve Kmeto, Cuba Gooding Jr., Sandra Bernhard, Lance Bass, Andy Dick(as the ugly masseuse), Fabio, Donald Trump, Tom Ford, Tommy Hilfiger, Lenny Kravitz, Gwen Stefani, Heidi Klum, Mark Ronson, Paris Hilton, Nora Dunn, Tyson Beckford, Steven Dorff, Patton Oswalt, Anne Mearra, Victoria Beckham, Claudia Schiffer, Lukas Haas, Wynona Ryder and several others.Derek Zoolander(Stiller) is a stupid male model that becomes devistated when he loses the Male Model of the Year Award to Hansel(Owen Wilson) and then loses his father\\'s respect(Voight). To top that off, his best friends die in a freak gasoline fight accident, reporter Matilda Jeffries(Taylor) is writing mean articles about Derek and he is being brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia by fashion guru Jacobim Mugatu(Ferrell) and his assistant Katinka Ogoboginaghahada(Jovovich). Of course, Derek is stupid beyond belief, so he can\\'t figure out that he\\'s being brainwashed, so Matilda and hand model J.P. Pruitt(Duchovny) help him along the way. There are over a hundred cameos in this film, which all add to the zaniness. This is one laugh after another, especially when his friends have the gasoline fight, which is a classic scene! my rating....90%. PG-13 for sexuality and dirty humor. 83 minutes.\"', '\"By being way too obvious and over the top with it\\'s humor and choosing to make fun of movies that were popular at the time rather than the horror genre as a whole or even a horror movie so iconic that it was worth satirizing, \"Scary movie\" definitely stands out from other parodies of the past, but much like most of the movies it makes fun of, it feels all the more dated as the years go by. As far as it\\'s sense of humor is concerned, while there is no denying that there are a lot of really funny moments, the rest either trys too hard, doesn\\'t try at all or gets completely out of hand depending on the situation.\"', '\"Funny how it was banned in Malaysia. When did the world stop having a sense of humour? This film will have you in stitches! Ben Stiller is the king of all artists.\"', '\"I actually wanted to see this at the time. Maybe thats why I ended up hating it so much. It was incredible....I didn\\'t laugh even once. Any parts that seemed at least half humorous ended up being shown in the commercials. What is really disappointing to find out is that the usually very funny Wayans lay claim to this piece of garbage.\"', '\"Sandra Bullock doesn\\'t disappoint in this movie.  I really like this movie. Sandra Bullock plays a detective who doesn\\'t have a life outside of her work.  She and a group of detectives begin working on a case concerning the miss united states pageant.  I don\\'t know how interesting that sounds, but it\\'s really funny.  4/5.\"', '\"So i decided to watch this because Sandra Bullock is in it and this is one of her most well-known movies and i can see why. This movie has a good plot that was really intriguing till the end and there were a lot of funny moments especially from Sandra Bullock who i have to say was great in the movie. The action scenes were good, but I think there should have been more of them and that\\'s probably the reason why the movie has a low rating and has gotten negative reviews. However, i still think the movie is good and hilarious and i would definitely recommend comedy movie fans to watch this if they haven\\'t before.\"', '\"Wonderful. After seeing this movie, not only am I in love with Renee Zellweger, I have fallen for Bridget Jones as well. Ms. Zellweger is truly the only actress to do Bridget justice, and she does so with amazing accuracy.  Hugh Grant also turns in a good performance as Bridget\\'s boss, Daniel Cleever. I gave this movie a 9 because in a season with so much special effects garbage and overall bad movies (i.e. Mummy Returns and Knight\\'s Tale), Bridget Jones\\'s Diary has restored my faith in Hollywood to put out a good movie every once in a while.\"', '\"Zellwegger continues on from \"Nurse Betty\", and is the best thing about the film. The film dispenses with the anguish and insecurity, instead settling for the cheap laughs. Having said that I only get to see a romantic comedy every other year, and it held my attention.Why does Hollywood in 2001 still have to portray London as a Dickensian winter wonderland??\"', '\"This movie is essentially a parody of \"Scream\" and \"I know what you did last summer\" but also contains parodies of \"Matrix\", \"Sixth Sense\", \"The Blair Witch Project\", \"Baywatch\", \"Titanic\" and \"The usual suspects\", among others. Very recomendable movie, but I must warn you, it\\'s extremely pornographic. I think the most pornographic movie I\\'ve seen in my whole life!\"', '\"Shoot yourself in the foot.  This would be better than watching ZOOLANDER. Better yet, pay someone $3.95 to do it.  Or burn the money, that\\'s still good because you can enjoy the few seconds of flame.  But do not watch this. It will devour your soul.  It is a movie that makes me want to puke until I am dead.Seriously though this movie lacked a few things.  While having plenty of cameos and famous people it did not have any of the following:1.  Funny Things 2.  A Plot Line 3.  Anything that made sense 4.  Understandable lines 5.  A reason to existSave yourself now.  Run.  Before its too late.\"', '\"Wonderful film with a fantastic performance by the super-talented Renee Zwelleger, ably supported by Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, both marvelous, as was the entire cast.Strangely, I saw this film and \"Someone Like You\" around the same time -the basic plots are the same, though the subplots are quite different.  And, of course, both use the song \"Someone Like You\" at the end!  But Bridget Jones is a real film and Someone Like You a TV movie reject someone got Ashley Judd to star in.  Amazing how the same basic plot can be so differently handled.There were many laugh out loud moments, to the extent that a man behind me said, \"I\\'d like to hear the movie,\" after Hugh Grant gave a line reading that rocked the audience.  I had one criticism and that was that the film could have been a little shorter.  Bravo, Renee and the entire cast on a great time at the movies.\"', '\"Well, there really isn\\'t that much to say about this movie. It\\'s very enjoyable and has plenty of jokes. Bruce Willis really does a great job as hit-man Jimmy The Tulip, Matthew Perry does his usual funny shtick, and Amanda Peet gets topless, which isn\\'t unusual but always nice.Director Jonathan Lynn, whose 1985 adaptation of Clue is a hilarious underrated comic masterpiece, delivers a fine mob comedy here which you should definitely check out if you\\'re a fan of either of the two main stars, comedies in general, or more precisely other mafia-type funnies such as the Analyze This series or Hugh Grant\\'s Mickey Blue Eyes.I hear the sequel isn\\'t that good. Maybe that\\'s true, won\\'t stop me from watching it though, but you can\\'t really go wrong with this movie which is pretty much a guaranteed good time.\"', '\"Well it\\'s about time someone made a movies that was as spiritually bankrupt and amoral as this movie was. Thank whoever for Mr Wapner and Mr Lynn for bringing this to the screen.\\'The Whole Nine Yards\\' was a light yet fun film who made being a hitman more like a viable career option than an immoral murderous activity. The plot was easy to follow and Willis proved he could make fun of his hard-man roles. Matthew Perry also shows a flair for slapstick and plays comedy well away from the awful froth that is \\'Friends\\'.A nice waste of a couple of hours. Recommended but not for the more moral and uptight amongst us.\"', '\"I liked the movie a lot, saw it already 2 times, although I liked the book better, I think they changed the story too much. Nevertheless it is a witty , very well casted film. As a true fan of Colin Firth, once again he is proving his versatile actorship and moreover he is adorable good looking, once again his P&P Mr Darcy fans could melt away . Finally Hugh Grant got the opportunity to show us he really can play another character than the stammering , insecure, confused  worshipper. And RenÃ©e, she is  captivating. I am looking forward to the sequel, wit CF in a double role?\"', '\"Bridget Jones\\'s Diary is a very entertaining and very light romantic comedy that is well written, well cast and subtlety humorous from start to finish. Renee Zellweger captures the character of Bridget very well, quickly allowing the audience to empathise with her vulnerabilities and relationship issues, and thankfully Hugh Grant and Colin Firth support her excellently along with the rest of the cast.On the down side, I did find some of the scenes a little cringe worthy to endure and i did feel that there were not enough laugh out-loud moments.All in all Bridget Jones\\'s Diary is a winner, and although better suited to a female audience; is still has enough to entertain most fans of the genre.7/10\"', '\"WARNING: MILD SPOILERI don\\'t believe this film deserves either the high praise or damnation it\\'s getting from IMDB users here.  It works well for what it is: an entertaining, frothy film, not out to deliver any sort of message or grand theme but just to deliver laughs.  Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis do journeyman work here, but the real joy here is in the supporting roles, especially Amanda Peet\\'s twisted receptionist-cum-hitwoman and Michael Clarke Duncan, proving that he\\'s going to be a screen presence for some time to come.Aside from the resolution of Duncan\\'s character, which seems oddly harsh and out-of-place, the movie will flow over you as smoothly as a vanilla milk shake, with as much meaning or impact.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy.  If you want deep meaning in your comedy, wait for the next Woody Allen movie.7 out of 10\"']\n"

In both cases, the MSE values are quite large, indicating a significant amount of error or deviation in the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the R-squared values, we can observe that the R-squared for the comedy regression analysis (0.0798) is higher than the R-squared for the action regression analysis (0.0125). The R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (box office revenue) that can be explained by the independent variable(s) (sentiment scores). In both cases, the R-squared values are relatively low, indicating that a small percentage of the variance in box office revenue can be explained by the sentiment scores. However, the comedy regression model performs slightly better in explaining the variance compared to the action regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, both the action and comedy regression models have limitations in their predictive performance. The sentiment scores alone may not be strong predictors of box office revenue for either genre. Improvements to the models may involve considering additional variables or factors that influence box office performance, such as movie release date, marketing strategies, or other relevant features.\n",

    "# Managerial implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "For comedy movies: Given the higher R-squared value, sentiment scores seem to have a more significant impact on the box office revenue of comedy movies. Filmmakers and studios can pay closer attention to audience sentiment and use it as a potential indicator of the movie's success. They may consider investing in marketing strategies that target the sentiments associated with comedy genres to attract more viewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For action movies: The lower R-squared value suggests that sentiment scores have a relatively weaker influence on the box office revenue of action movies. Filmmakers and studios should focus on other factors such as star power, action sequences, and storyline to attract audiences and drive box office success. While sentiment scores may still provide some insights, they may not be as reliable in predicting revenue for action movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, understanding the differential impact of sentiment scores on different genres can help movie industry professionals make more informed decisions regarding production, marketing, and audience targeting strategies for comedy and action movies."
